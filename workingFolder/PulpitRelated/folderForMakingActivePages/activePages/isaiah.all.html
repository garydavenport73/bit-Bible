A foreign conquest, accompanied by slaughter, and the deportation of captives, is not obscurely intimated. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 20, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-23.htm">Isaiah 5:23</a>, etc.).

It was certainly prevalent in Judah, it may also have been practiced in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And that write grievousness</span>, etc. Translate, <span class="accented">and unto the writers that enregister oppression</span>. The decrees of courts were, it is clear, carefully engrossed by the officials, probably upon parchment, every outward formality being observed, while justice itself was set at naught.

These were the classes who were the chief sufferers by the perversion of justice (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17, 23</a>). They were exactly the classes for whom God had most compassion, and whom he had commended in the Law to the tender care of his people (see note on Isaiah 9:17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-3.htm">Isaiah 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation <i>which</i> shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What will ye do in the day of visitation</span>? "The day of visitation" is the day when God reckons with his servants, and demands an account from each of the work done in his vineyard, being prepared to recompense the good and punish the bad (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>). It is oftenest used in a bad sense because, unhappily, so many more are found to deserve punishment than reward<span class="cmt_word">. The desolation which shall come from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the crashing ruin</span> (Cheyne). It is sudden, and complete destruction, rather than mere desolateness, that is threatened. Previous prophecies, especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-20</a>, had informed the Jews that it was to "come from far," "by them that were beyond the river." <span class="cmt_word">To whom will ye flee</span>? The prophet speaks in bitter irony. Is there any one to whom ye can flee? any one who can protect you from the wrath of God? Ye well know there is no one. <span class="cmt_word">Where will ye leave your glory</span>? With whom will ye deposit your riches, your magnificence, your jewels, your grand apparel? You cannot save them. They will all make to  themselves wings, and "fly away like a bird" (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-4.htm">Isaiah 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand <i>is</i> stretched out still.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Without me</span>. That this is a possible rendering of the word used seems proved by <a href="../../par/hosea/13-4.htm">Hosea 13:4</a>. But here it scarcely suits the context. God does not speak directly, in the first person, elsewhere in the entire prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8-10:4</a>), but is spoken of in the third person throughout, as even in the present verse, where we have "his anger," "his hand." It is better, therefore, to give the word its ordinary meaning - "unless," "except." Have they anywhere to flee to, unless they shall crouch amid the captives that are being carried off, or fall amid the slain? In other words, there is no escape for them; they must either submit to captivity or death. <span class="cmt_word">For all this</span>, etc. Even when the two kingdoms were destroyed, and the captivity of both was complete, God's wrath was not fully appeased, his anger was not wholly turned away. Both peoples suffered grievous things in their captivity, as appears from the Book of Daniel (<a href="../../par/isaiah/3.htm">Isaiah 3, 6</a>.) and other places. It took seventy years for God's anger to be appeased in the case of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>), while in the case of Israel it was never appeased. Crushed beneath the iron heel of their conquerors, Israel ceased to exist as a nation. SECTION V. PROPHECIES OF WOE UPON FOREIGN NATIONS (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-23</a>) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-19.</span> - ASSYRIA, AFTER BEING GOD'S INSTRUMENT TO PUNISH ISRAEL, SHALL HERSELF BE PUNISHED IN HER TURN. The wicked are a sword in the hand of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/17-13.htm">Psalm 17:13</a>), wherewith he executes his judgments; but this fact is hid from them, and they imagine that they are successful through their own strength and might. So it was with Assyria (vers. 5-14), which its long career of victory had made proud and arrogant above measure. God now, by the mouth of Isaiah, makes known his intention of bringing down the pride of Assyria, and laying her glory in the dust, by a sudden and great destruction (vers. 15:19), after she has served his purposes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Assyrian</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Ho! Asshur</span>. "Asshur" is the nation personified, and is here addressed as an individual. The transition from vers. 1-4 is abrupt, and may be taken to indicate an accidental juxtaposition of two entirely distinct prophecies. Or Assyria may be supposed to have been in the prophet's thought, though not in his words, when he spoke of "prisoners" and "slain" in the first clause of ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of mine anger</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>, where it is said of Babylon, "Thou art my battle-axe and weapons of war; for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy the kingdoms"). So Assyria was now the "rod" wherewith God chastised his enemies. The true "staff" in the hand of Assyria, wherewith she smote the peoples, was "God's indignation." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will send him against an hypocritical nation</span>; or, <span class="accented">against a corrupt nation</span>. Israel in the wider sense, inclusive of Judah, seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">The people of my wrath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the people who are the object of my wrath." <span class="cmt_word">Will I give him a charge</span>. In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-25.htm">2 Kings 18:25</a> Sennacherib nays, "Am I come up without the Lord (Jehovah) against thin, lace, to destroy it? The Lord (Jehovah) said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it" (compare below, <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a>). It has been usual to consider Sennacherib's words a vain boast; but if God instructed Nebuchadnezzar through dreams, may he not also by the same means have "given charges" to Assyrian monarchs? <span class="cmt_word">To take the spoil, and to take the prey</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to gather spoil</span>, <span class="accented">and seize prey</span>. The terms used carry the thoughts back to <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>, and to the symbolic name, Maher-shalal-hash-baz. <span class="cmt_word">And to tread them down</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to make it a trampling</span>. "It" refers to "nation" in the first clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but <i>it is</i> in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit he meaneth not so</span>. "Assyria," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "does not view the matter in this light - is not aware that she is merely God's instrument in working out his will. On the contrary, it is in her heart to destroy the nations for her own advantage, and she imagines that she is doing it by her own strength." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">For he saith, <i>Are</i> not my princes altogether kings?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are not my princes altogether kings</span>? One mark of the superiority of Assyria to other countries was to be seen in the fact that her king had not mere officers, but vassal kings under him. Hence the title "king of kings" assumed by so many Assyrian monarchs. While conquered territories were by degrees and to a certain extent absorbed into the empire and placed under prefects (see the 'Eponym Canon'), an outer zone of more loosely organized dependencies was always maintained by the Assyrians; and these dependencies continued ordinarily to be administered by their native monarchs (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 524-526). These are the "princes" who were "altogether kings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is</i> not Calno as Carchemish? <i>is</i> not Hamath as Arpad? <i>is</i> not Samaria as Damascus?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is not Calno as Carehemish</span>? A further proof of superiority, and ground of confidence, lay in the further fact, that the strongest cities had, one and all, succumbed to the Assyrian arms, and been laid in ruins to punish them for offering resistance. Six such cities are mentioned - Calneh, probably Niffer, in Lower Mesopotamia; Carchemish, on the right bank of the Euphrates in Lat. 36&deg; 30' nearly; Hamath, the "great Hamath" of Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>), in Coelesyria on the routes; Arpad, perhaps Tel-Erfad, near Aleppo; Damascus, and Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Calneh</span> was one of the cities of Nimrod (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>), and, according to the LXX., was "the place where the tower was built." It may have been taken by Tiglath-Pileser in one of his expeditious into Babylonia. Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>) speaks of it as desolate in his day. <span class="cmt_word">Carchemish</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Gargamis</span>) was a chief city of the Hittites, and has been called "their northern capital." Long confounded by geographers with Circesium at the junction of the Khabour with the Euphrates, it has recently been proved to have occupied a far more northern position, and is now generally identified with the ruins discovered by Mr. George Smith at Jerabis or Jerabhs. It was conquered by Sargon in  <span class="date">B.C. 717</span>, when "its people were led captive, and scattered over the Assyrian empire, while Assyrian colonists were brought to people the city in their place; Carchemish being formally annexed to Assyria, and placed under an Assyrian governor" (G. Smith, 'Assyria,' p. 97). <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span> was originally a Canaanite city (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>). By the time of David it had become the scat of an independent monarchy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9, 10</a>), and so continued until its reduction by the Assyrians. We find it leagued with the Hittites, the Syrians of Damascus, and the Israelites against Assyria about  <span class="date">B.C. 850</span> ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 361-363). About  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> it was taken by Sargon, who beheaded its king, and probably reduced it to ruins (ibid., p. 411; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). The name remains in the modern <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, where many curious inscriptions have been recently dug up. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span> was attacked by Tiglath-Pileser in the early part of his reign, and reduced to subjection. It revolted in conjunction with Hamath from Sargon, and was severely punished ('Ancient Monarchies,' l.s.c.). <span class="cmt_word">Is not Samaria as Damascus?</span> This mention of Samaria among the subjugated and ruined cities may undoubtedly be prophetic; but the connection with Carchemish, Hamath, and Arpad all of them towns reduced by Sargon within the years  <span class="date">B.C. 720-717</span> - points rather to the verse being historical, and would seem to indicate that the date of the entire prophecy - vers. 5-19  - is subsequent to the capture of the cities, and so not earlier than  <span class="date">B.C. 716</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols.</span> "Found" here means "reached," "punished... subjugated." It is quite in accordance with Assyrian ideas that the conquered countries should be called "kingdoms of the idols" (literally, "no gods"). The Assyrian monarchs regarded their own gods as alone really deserving of the name, and made war very much with the object of proving the superiority of their deities over those of their neighbors. Hence their practice of carrying off the idols from the various cities which they conquered, or else of inscribing on them "the praises of Asshur." <span class="cmt_word">And whose graven images</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and their graven images</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Did excel</span>. In preciousness of material or in workmanship, or both. The Assyrians went near to identifying the idols with the gods themselves. <span class="cmt_word">Those of Jerusalem and of Samaria</span>. The chief Samaritan idols were the golden calves at Dan and Bethel; but, in addition to these, "images and groves were set up in every high hill and under every green tree" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>), images of Baal, and Ashtoreth, and perhaps Beltis, and Chemosh, and Moloch. Even in Judah and in Jerusalem itself there were idols. Ahaz "made molten images for Baalim" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>). The brazen serpent was worshipped as an idol at Jerusalem until Hezekiah destroyed it; and probably, even after the reformation of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), many Jews retained privately the images, which he required them to destroy (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). Isaiah had already declared, speaking of Judah rather than of Israel, "Their land is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-8.htm">Isaiah 2:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-11.htm">Isaiah 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I not... so do to Jerusalem and her idols</span>? The speaker ignores the fact of any difference in kind between the religion of Judaea and that of the neighboring countries. He speaks as if he knew nothing of any religion without idols. No doubt Assyrian ideas on the subject of the religion of the Jews were at this time, as they were even later (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-22.htm">2 Kings 18:22</a>), exceedingly vague and incorrect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. The final result shall be such as "the Assyrian" little expected. <span class="cmt_word">When the Lord hath performed his whole work.</span> The "work" assigned to Assyria was the destruction of the kingdom of Israel, and a share in the trial, punishment, and discipline of Judah. The last task seems to have been the humiliation of Manasseh, which brought about his repentance (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11-13</a>). Soon after this the troubles began which led to her destruction. <span class="cmt_word">I will punish</span>. The sudden change from the third to the first person is harsh and abnormal, but not without parallels in other passages of Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-3.htm">Isaiah 5:3, 4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The fruit of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">stout heart</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the actions, language, etc., which flowed from the stoutness of heart - such language, e.g., as that of vers. 8-11 and 13, 14. <span class="cmt_word">Of the King of Assyria</span>. The menace is not leveled against any one particular king, as Sargon, or Sennacherib; but against the monarchy itself, which from first to last was actuated by the same spirit, and breathed the same tone, of pride, selfishness, and cruelty. (See the royal inscriptions, <span class="accented">passim</span>, which become more revolting as time goes on.)

Neither this speech nor that in vers. 8-11, nor again that given in <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24, 25</a>, is to be regarded as historical in the sense of being the actual utterance of any Assyrian monarch. All are imaginary, speeches, composed by the prophet, whereby he expresses in his own language the thoughts which Assyrian kings entertained in their hearts. <span class="cmt_word">I have removed the bounds of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of peoples</span>. Assyrian monarchs take as one of their titles "the remover of boundaries and landmarks" (G.

The plunder of conquered countries is constantly recorded by the Assyrian monarchs as one of the most important results of each successful expedition. It is not infrequently represented in the sculptures (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 85). <span class="cmt_word">I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</span> The passage is obscure; and many different renderings have been given. Perhaps the best is that of Mr. Cheyne, "I have brought down, like a mighty one, those that sat on thrones." <span class="accented">Abbir</span>, however, the word translated "a mighty one," as often means "a bull" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-13.htm">Psalm 50:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-30.htm">Psalm 68:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>).

The Assyrians are fond of comparing their enemies to birds ('Records of the Past,' vol. 7. pp. 36, 62, etc.); but the exact metaphor here used does not, I believe, occur in the inscriptions. The nations' treasures are like eggs found in deserted nests, which the hunter gathers without any, even the slightest, risk. <span class="cmt_word">All the earth</span>. Oriental hyperbole. Assyrian monarchs often say that they "have subdued all the races of men," or "carried the glory of their name to the ends of the earth," or "overthrown the armies of the whole world in battle." <span class="cmt_word">Peeped</span>; rather, <span class="accented">chirped</span> (see note on Isaiah 8:19).

A continuation of ver. 12, showing what the nature of Assyria's punishment shall be. The prophet expresses it by two images - first, that of a wasting sickness; and secondly, that of a fire. The first image expresses that gradual decay of national spirit which saps the vital strength of a nation; the second is more suited to denote some external attack under which the weakened nation should succumb. There are traces, in the later history of Assyria, both of increasing internal weakness through luxury and effeminacy, and of violent external attacks culminating in the combined Median and Babylonian invasion, before which her power collapsed (Abyden. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' pars <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 9; Syncell., 'Chronograph.,' p, 210, B; Tobit 14:15).

A new name of God.

God enlightens his people, cheers them, comforts them spiritually, as the light of the sun enlightens, cheers, and comforts men physically. Christ, as true God, is "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for a fire.</span> As the same material fire which gives light, warmth, and comfort may burn and destroy, so the spiritual light, finding fit material, scorches and consumes.

Scarcely "in one battle" (Cheyne); for the destruction of Assyria was effected by many battles, many sieges, and much exhausting ravage. "In one day" rather means "at one and the same time,"  "within a brief space." It is not to he taken literally.

"Forest" and "fruitful field" (<span class="accented">carmel</span>) are sometimes united together, sometimes contrasted. Literally, they denote wild and cultivated woodland. Used symbolically, as here, they are not so much intended to designate different parts of Assyria's glory, as to convey the idea that the destruction will be universal. <span class="cmt_word">Both soul and body.</span> Here metaphor is suddenly dropped, and Isaiah shows that he is speaking of the Assyrian <span class="accented">people</span>, not of the land or its products. Their destruction, wicked as they were, would be one both of body and soul. <span class="cmt_word">As when a standard-bearer fainteth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as when one that is faint fainteth</span>.

Still, there is reason for the faithful to take courage and be of good heart; Assyria will shortly receive a check (vers. 24-27) - when her armies swoop upon Jerusalem, God will swoop down on her (vers. 28-34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "at that time"  - the time of the destruction of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Israel</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>).

This promise had been fulfilled (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>); but now the sins of the people would produce a reversal of it. It would be a remnant, <span class="accented">and only a remnant</span>, of the nation that would escape.

Isaiah uses the metaphor of the "scourge" again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16, 18</a>.

An allusion to the drowning of Pharaoh's host in the Red Sea. This was a nearer parallel to the destruction of Sennacherib's army than the slaughter of the Midianites, since it was wholly miraculous. By "his rod" we may understand the rod of Moses, endued by God with miraculous powers (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-3.htm">Exodus 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After the manner of Egypt</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of his action in Egypt."

Isaiah sees it in vision (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>), and describes it like an eye-witness. There are at present no sufficient means of deciding to what particular attack it refers, or indeed whether the march is one conducted by Sennacherib or Sargon. Sargon calls himself in one inscription "<span class="accented">conqueror</span> of the land of Judah" (Layard, 'Inscriptions,' 33:8), and the details of the present prophecy, especially ver. 9, suit the reign of Sargon rather than that of his son, so that on the whole it is perhaps most probable that some expedition of Sargon's is portrayed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is come to Aiath</span>. "Aiath" is probably Ai (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-1.htm">Joshua 8:1-28</a>), with a feminine termination. It lay about three miles south of Bethel, which had become Assyrian with the conquest of Samaria. If an Assyrian army mustered at Bethel, it would naturally enter Judaean territory at Ai. <span class="cmt_word">He is passed to Migron</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he has passed through Migron</span>. "Migron" is mentioned as a village in the territory of Gibeah of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a>); but the Migron of this passage must have been further to the north. <span class="cmt_word">He hath laid up his carriages</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "has left his baggage-train." Michmash was about seven miles nearly due north of Jerusalem. The heavy baggage might conveniently be left there, especially as it was difficult of attack (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-4.htm">1 Samuel 14:4-13</a>), while a lightly equipped body of troops made a dash at Jerusalem.

Ramah is, no doubt, <span class="accented">Er-Ram</span>, a village on an eminence, as the name implies, about six miles north of Jerusalem, and on the direct road from Beitin. Gibeah of Saul is thought to have occupied the site of the modern <span class="accented">Tuleil-el-Ful</span>, two miles nearer Jerusalem. It is certainly a distinct place from Geba.

Gallim and Laish must have been villages between Geba and Jerusalem; but it is impossible to fix their site. Anathoth (now <span class="accented">Aaata</span>) obtains mention in Joshua as a city of refuge in the territory of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-18.htm">Joshua 21:18</a>).

The recovery is connected - or rather identified with the coming of Messiah, whose character is beautifully portrayed (vers. 2-5).

Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant"). "The stem of Jesse" must mean the house of David, for there is but one Jesse (<span class="accented">Ishai</span>) in Scripture - David's father. <span class="cmt_word">A Branch shall grow out of his roots</span>. That which is at first a sapling gains strength and grows into a "branch" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>, where the word used, though different, is synonymous). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him</span> (comp, <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-40.htm">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1, 14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, etc.). The human nature of our Lord required, and received abundantly, the sanctifying and enlightening influences of the Holy Spirit. These influences were not in him transient or occasional, as in too many men, who more or less "<span class="accented">resist</span> the Spirit," but permanent and enduring. They "<span class="accented">rested upon"</span> him; from first to last never quitted, and never will quit, him. <span class="cmt_word">The spirit of wisdom and understanding.</span> The influences of the Holy Spirit are manifold, affecting the entire complex nature of man (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-8.htm">1 Corinthians 12:8-11</a>). Here, three pairs of graces are set forth as specially manifested in the Messiah through the power of the Spirit: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Wisdom and understanding," or intellectual and moral apprehension (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) the ability to perceive moral and abstract truth; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "counsel and might," or the power at once to scheme and originate, and also to carry out thought into act; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "The knowledge and the fear of the Lord," or acquaintance with the true will of God, combined with the determination to carry out that will to the full (<a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-7.htm">Hebrews 10:7</a>). It is needless to say that all these qualities existed in the greatest perfection in our blessed Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall make him of quick understanding</span>. This rendering of the original, though defended by Dr. Kay, is quite without support from any other passage where the same word is used. Modern writers almost all translate, either "the breath of his nostrils shall be in the fear of the Lord" (Herder, Ewald, Meier, Cheyne), or "a sweet savor shall he find in the fear of the Lord" (Gesenius, Delitzsch, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">He shall not judge after the sight of his eyes.</span> "God sooth the heart." Our Lord "knew men's thoughts" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>, etc.), and therefore did not need to "judge according to the appearance" (<a href="../../par/john/7-24.htm">John 7:24</a>). Thus his judgments were always righteous. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With righteousness shall he judge the poor</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>, "A king shall reign in righteousness"). It would be characteristic of the Messiah's rule that the poor should be eared for, that oppression should cease, and judgment be no more perverted in favor of the rich. There is an intended contrast between the Messiah's rule in this respect, and that of the princes of Judah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-15.htm">Isaiah 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1, 2</a>). Christian countries still, for the most part, follow their Lord's example in this particular, if in no other, having judges that are incorruptible, and tribunals that are free from any leaning against the poor. <span class="cmt_word">Reprove</span>; or, <span class="accented">plead</span> (as in <a href="../../par/job/16-21.htm">Job 16:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The meek of the earth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the humble</span>, or <span class="accented">afflicted</span>. Low condition, not meekness of spirit, is what the word used expresses. <span class="cmt_word">He shall smite the earth.</span> A slight alteration of the text produces the meaning, <span class="accented">be shall smite the terrible one</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>), which improves the parallelism of the clauses. But there is no need of any alteration, parallelism in Isaiah being often incomplete. The Messiah at his coming will "smite <span class="accented">the earth"</span> generally (see <a href="../../par/malachi/4-6.htm">Malachi 4:6</a>, and comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34</a>, "I came not to send peace on the earth, but a sword"), and will also especially chastise "the wicked." <span class="cmt_word">The rod of his mouth... the breath of his lips</span>. "The Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). The sayings of Christ pierce the conscience and penetrate the soul as no other words that ever came from a human mouth. In the last day words from his mouth will consign to everlasting life or to everlasting destruction. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-5.htm">Isaiah 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "righteousness shall be ever with him, ever ready for active use, ever (as it were) bracing him for action."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-9.</span> - Messiah's kingdom, when fully realized, shall be one of perfect peace. "<span class="accented">They</span> shall neither hurt nor destroy in <span class="accented">all</span> his holy mountain." Primarily, no doubt, the passage is figurative, and points to harmony among men, who, in Messiah's kingdom, shall no longer prey one upon another (see especially ver. 9). But, from the highest spiritual standpoint, the figure itself becomes a reality, and it is seen that, if in the "new heavens and new earth" there is an animal creation, it will be fitting that there harmony should equally prevail among the inferior creation. Human sin may not have introduced rapine and violence among the beasts - at least, geologists tell us that animals preyed one upon another long before the earth was the habitation of man - but still man's influence may prevail to eradicate the beasts' natural impulses and educate them to something higher. Already domestication produces an accord and harmony that is in a certain sense against nature. May not this be carried further in the course of ages, and Isaiah's picture have a literal fulfillment? Jerome's scorn of the notion as a poetic dream has about it something harsh and untender. Will not God realize all, and more than all, of love and happiness that poets' dreams can reach to? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wolf... the leopard... the young lion... the bear</span> are the only ferocious animals of Palestine, where the tiger, the crocodile, the alligator, and the jaguar are unknown. That the Palestinian bear was carnivorous, and a danger to man, appears by <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-10.htm">Lamentations 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-19.htm">Amos 5:19</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A little child shall lead them.</span> Man's superiority over the brute creation shall continue, and even be augmented. The most powerful beasts shall submit to the control of a child.

There is nothing impossible in this. Cats are fond of some kinds of vegetable food. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by the hole -</span> near it. The "asp" is probably the <span class="accented">Coluber Naje</span> of Egypt, whose bite is very deadly. The cockatrice den. The "cockatrice" is another deadly serpent, perhaps the <span class="accented">Daboia xanthina</span> (Tristram, 'Natural Hist. of the Bible'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My holy mountain</span>. As the Jewish Church is always bound up with the "holy hill of Zion," so the Messianic one receives the designation of "the mountain of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), or "the holy mountain" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>). What was physically true of the type is transferred to the antitype, which is "a city set upon a hill" in a certain sense. <span class="cmt_word">The earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord</span> (romp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/28.htm">Matthew 28</a>:29). A fruitful knowledge, guiding and influencing conduct, seems to be intended (see below, <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord, and great shall be the peace of thy children"). <span class="cmt_word">As the waters cover the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "as the ocean covers and fills the bed prepared for it." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-13.</span> - THE JEWS AND GENTILES SHALL BE GATHERED TOGETHER INTO MESSIAH'S KINGDOM. It is characteristic of "the evangelical prophet" that he dwells earnestly and frequently on the calling of the Gentiles (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-22.htm">Isaiah 19:22-25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-13.htm">Isaiah 27:13</a>, etc.). The prophecies to Abraham had repeatedly declared that "in him," or "in his seed," "all the families of the earth should be blessed" (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>); and some of the psalmists had echoed the glad sound and spoken of God as worshipped generally by "the nations" (<a href="../../par/psalms/117-1.htm">Psalm 117:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-11.htm">Psalm 148:11</a>). But the idea had taken little hold upon the chosen people generally; and was practically new to them when Isaiah was inspired to preach it afresh. To render it the more palatable, he unites with it the promise of a great gathering of the dispersed Israelites from all quarters to the banner of Messiah, when it is set up. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall he a root of Jesse</span>. The "root" of this place is the same as the "rod" and "branch" of ver. 1. The "rod" springs up out of a "root," and is inseparably connected with it. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall stand for an ensign of the people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the peoples</span>. The "rod" shall lift itself up, and become an ensign, seen from afar, and attracting to itself the attention of "the peoples" or "nations" generally. The Acts and Epistles show how speedily this prophecy was fulfilled. Greeks, Romans, Galatians, Cappadoeians, Babylonians (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>), saw the ensign, and sought to it. <span class="cmt_word">His rest shall be glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his resting-place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his Church, with which he abides forever (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The Shechinah of his presence makes the Church "glorious" (literally, "a glory") throughout all ages; but the glory will not fully appear till the time of the "new heavens and new earth" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; Roy. 21, 22.), when he will dwell visibly with it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover</span>, etc. The first recovery was from the servitude in Egypt. Isaiah now foresees that there will be a dispersion of the Israelites through several distant lands, instead of a mere transference of them from one land to another, as in Jacob's time (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1-29</a>). God, who brought them out of Egypt, will likewise some day "set his hand" to recover them from the various countries through which they will have been dispersed, and restore them to their own land once more. The first fulfillment of the prophecy was undoubtedly, the return from the Babylonian captivity. A secondary fulfillment may have been the gathering of so many Jews from all quarters into the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9-41</a>). It is possible that there may be ultimately a further fulfillment in a final gathering together of Israel into their own land. <span class="cmt_word">From Assyria</span>. Assyria is placed first because already the bulk of the Israelites, as distinct from the Jews, had been carried into Assyria by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) and Sargon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>), and were captives there at the time when Isaiah wrote. The transportation of Israelites to the other places mentioned was subsequent to his day. <span class="cmt_word">Egypt... Pathros</span>. There was a great migration of Jews into Egypt in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>), and a steady influx for some generations under the early Ptolemies. There was also a second large migration in the time of Onias. The Jewish element in Alexandria for some centuries both before and after Christ was very considerable. Pathros was probably a portion of Upper Egypt, perhaps the Phaturite nome, which was the district about Thebes. It is mentioned as the residence of certain Jews in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1, 15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From Cush.</span> "Cush" here may he either the African or the Asiatic. It is slightly in favor of the African that we hear in the Acts of an Ethiopian eunuch who was a Jew in the service of Candace, Queen of the African Ethiopia (<a href="../../par/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>). And it is against the Asiatic that it was so remote. It adjoined, however, upon Elam. <span class="cmt_word">From Elam, and from Shinar</span>. "Elam" was the fertile tract of alluvial land to the east of the Tigris, between that stream and the mountains, parallel with Babylonia. Its capital was Susa, and in Isaiah's time it was an important country, frequently at war with Assyria. Shinar was an ancient name of Babylonia (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/11-1.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The word is used also by Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>) and Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>). Some regard it as meaning "the land of the <span class="accented">two fleers</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>From Hamath.</span> (On this town, see note to <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">From the islands of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the islands and coasts of the Mediterranean. During the Maccabee period, there was a gradual spread of Jews over the Western world. Alliances were made with Rome end Sparta (1 Macc. 8:1 1 Macc. 12:2-21 1 Macc. 14:20-23, etc.), and Jews became familiar with both Greece and Italy. St. Paul finds numerous Jews at Rome, and in almost every city of Greece.

It is not to be supposed that actual war is intended. The subjects of the Prince of Peace will not draw the sword. But the Church will for many centuries be confronted by enemies, and must contend with them with legitimate weapons. It is this warfare of which Isaiah now speaks.

On each of her deliverances the Church is hound to praise God. In some parts of the Church it is customary on every such occasion to sing a "Te Deum." The ordinary Israelite hymn of praise appears to have been the hundred and thirty-sixth psalm (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-34.htm">1 Chronicles 16:34, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>; 1 Macc. 4:24); but on extraordinary occasions special thanksgivings were sung (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-21</a>; 1 Samuel 7:18-29, etc.).

Kay understands an actual hank-fullness for the severe discipline, which had checked them, and not allowed them to glide on smoothly to ruin. But perhaps the idiom is rather that of the passage, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes" (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>), where it is only the last clause that expresses the true object of the thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Comfortedst</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hast comforted</span>, since the effect continued.

The pronoun "I" is emphatic - "I myself." Not only will an external summons go forth, but God will lay his own orders on them whom he chooses for his instruments, and bid them come to the muster. All who carry out his purposes are, in a certain sense, "sanctified ones" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a>, etc.).

The high spirits, however, natural to gallant soldiers on going out to war, rather than any special haughtiness or arrogancy, are intended. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of a multitude in the mountains</span>. I do not know why Isaiah should not have been "thinking of his geography" (Cheyne). As soon as the Greeks knew anything of the Persians, they knew of them as a <span class="accented">mountain</span> people, and attributed their valor and their handy habits to the physical character of their country (Herod., 9. <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.). Jeremiah connects the invading army which destroyed Babylon with mountains, when he derives it from. Ararat (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-4.htm">Genesis 8:4</a>), Minni (Armenia), and Ashchenaz (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>). At any rate, the mention of "mountains" here is very appropriate, both Media and Persia being, in the main, mountainous countries. <span class="cmt_word">A great people</span>; or, <span class="accented">much people</span>  - not necessarily of one nation only. The host of the battle; rather, <span class="accented">a host of war</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a multitude of men, armed and prepared for war. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, <i>even</i> the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They come from a far country</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>). Both Media and Persia were "far countries" to the Hebrews, Persia especially. There is no indication that they knew of any countries more remote towards the East. Hence the expression which follows, "from the end of heaven" - the heaven being supposed to end where the earth ended. Isaiah, like the other sacred writers, conforms his language on cosmical subjects to the opinions of his day. Even the Lord. With a most effective anthropomorphism, Jehovah is made to march with the army that he has mustered (ver. 4) against the land that has provoked his wrath - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">The weapons</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:25; 51:20). <span class="cmt_word">To destroy the whole land.</span> Many critics would render <span class="accented">ha-arets</span> by "the earth" here. It may be granted that the language of the prophecy goes beyond the occasion in places (especially vers. 11 and 13), and passes from Babylon to that wicked world of which Babylon is a type; but, where the context permits, it seems better to restrict than to expand the meaning of the words employed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">Howl ye; for the day of the LORD <i>is</i> at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl ye; for the day of the Lord is at hand</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>); literally, the expression used in both passages is <span class="accented">a day of Jehovah</span>. The idiom would not, however, allow the use of the article, so that the phrase is ambiguous. "The day of Jehovah" is properly "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient" (Cheyne). But any great occasion when God passes judgment on a nation is called in Scripture "a day of the Lord." "a coming of Christ." And so here the day of the judgment upon Babylon seems to be intended. <span class="cmt_word">It shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</span> Isaiah is thought to quote from Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>) here; but perhaps both prophets quoted from an earlier author. Shaddai (equivalent to "Almighty') is an ancient name of God, most rarely used by the prophetical writers (only here, and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-5.htm">Ezekiel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>), and never elsewhere by either Isaiah or Joel. It has generally been said to mean "the Strong One;" but recently the theory has found favor that it meant originally "the Sender of storms," from the Arabic <span class="accented">sh'da - jecit</span>, <span class="accented">effudit</span>. However this may be, the word is certainly used in the later times mainly to express God's power to visit and punish, and the present passage might perhaps be best translated, "It shall come as a destruction from the Destroyer (<span class="accented">k'shod mish-Shaddai yabo</span>)."

Here the prophecy certainly goes beyond the destruction of Babylon, and becomes a general warning to the wicked of all court-tries. Each country is to feel that its turn will come.

Isaiah may, perhaps, pass here from signs connected with the fall of Babylon to those which will announce the last (lay - each "day of the Lord" being, as already observed, a type of the final and great day (see the comment on ver. 6). Or, possibly, the allusion may be to some "shaking" by God of a supra-mundane kingdom as preliminary to his passing judgment on Babylon (so Dr. Kay; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a>).

When a town was taken by assault, they were ruthlessly slaughtered. When spared, it was only to be dragged off as captives, and to become the slaves of their captors in a foreign land. Assyrian sculptures often illustrate this latter practice. Their wives ravished (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-11.htm">Lamentations 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>).

Isaiah's knowledge that the Medes should take a leading part in the destruction of Babylon is, no doubt, as surprising a fact as almost any other in the entire range of prophetic foresight, or insight, as set before us in Scripture. The Medes were known to Moses as an ancient nation of some importance (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>); but since his time had been unmentioned by any sacred writer; and, as a <span class="accented">living</span> nation, had only just come within the range of Israelite vision, by the fact that, when Sargon deported the Samaritans from Samaria, he placed some of them "in the cities of the Medes" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The Assyrians had become acquainted with them somewhat more than a century earlier, and had made frequent incursions into their country, finding them a weak and divided people, under the government of a large number of petty chiefs. Sargon had conquered a portion of the tribes, and placed prefects in the cities; at the same time planting colonists in them from other parts of the empire. That, when the weakness of Media was being thus made apparent, Isaiah should have foreseen its coming greatness can only be accounted for by his having received a Divine communication on the subject. Subsequently, he had a still more exact and complete communication (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not regard silver</span>. The Medes were not a particularly disinterested people; but in the attack on Babylon, made by Cyrus, the object was not plunder, but conquest and the extension of dominion. The main treasures of Babylon - those in the great temple of Bolus - were not carried off by Cyrus, as appears both from his own inscriptions, and from Herodotus (1. 181-183). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Their</i> bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their bows</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9, 14</a>). Both the Medes and the Persians were skilled archers. Herodotus tells us that every Persian youth was taught three things  - "to ride, to draw the bow, and to speak the truth" (1. 136). At Persepolis, Modes and Persians are alike represented as carrying bows and quivers. AEschyius regards the contest between the Persians and the Greeks as one between the arrow and the spear ('Persae,' 11. 135, 136). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Babylon, the glory of kingdoms</span>. The "<span class="accented">glory"</span> of Babylon consisted: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> In her antiquity.

As time went on, she grew in wealth and splendor. Perhaps it was granted to Isaiah to see her in ecstatic vision, not merely such as she was in the time of Sargon under Merodach-Baladan, but such as she became under Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of her kings, who raised her to the highest pitch or glory and eminence. The beauty of the Chaldees' excellency. The Kaldi appear to have been originally one of the many tribes by which Babylonia was peopled at an early date, From the expression, "Ur of the Chaldees," which occurs more than once in Genesis (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-28.htm">Genesis 11:28, 31</a>), we may gather that they were inhabitants of the more southern part of the country, near the coast. The same conclusion may be drawn from the Assyrian inscriptions, especially those of Shalmaneser II. - the Black Obelisk king. The term never became a general name for the Babylonian people among themselves or among the Assyrians; but, somehow-or other, it was accepted in that sense by the Jews, and is so used, not only by Isaiah, but also by the writers of Kings and Chronicles, by Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Habakkuk. <span class="cmt_word">As when God overthrew Sodom</span>.

This part of the prophecy did not receive its fulfillment till many centuries had gone by. From the time of Cyrus to that of Alexander the Great, Babylon was one of the chief cities of the Persian empire. Alexander was so struck with it, and with the excellence of its situation, that he designed to make it his capital. It first began seriously to decline under the Seleucidae, who built Seleucia on the Tigris as a rival to it, and still further injured it by fixing the seat of government at Antioch. But it had still a large population in the first century after our era (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 18:9, &sect; 8); and is mentioned as a place of some consequence in the time of Trajan (Die Cass., 68:27), and even in that of Severue (Die Cass., 75:9). But after this it went rapidly to decay. Under the Sassuntans it disappears from sight; and when Benjamin of Tudela, in the twelfth century, visited the spot, there was nothing to be seen of the mighty city but those ruins of the Kasr, or palace, which still arrest the traveler's attention. The site had become, and has ever since remained, "without inhabitant." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there.</span> A superstitious feeling prevents the Arabs from encamping on the mounds of Babylon, which are believed to be the haunts of evil spirits (Rich, 'First Memoir on Babylon,' p. 67; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 371). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</span> The nitrous soil of the Babylonian mounds allows them to produce nothing but the coarsest and most unpalatable vegetation. The shepherds consequently do not feed their flocks on them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a></div><div class="verse">But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wild beasts of the desert shall lie there</span>. It is not quite clear what particular wild beasts are intended. Those actually noted on the site of Babylon are lions, jackals, and porcupines.  These sometimes make their lairs in the ruins (Rich, 'First Memoir,' p. 69; Ker Porter, 'Travels,' vol. 2. p. 342). <span class="cmt_word">Doleful creatures</span>; in the original, <span class="accented">okhim</span>.

Mr. Rich says, "In most of the cavities of the Babil Mound there are numbers of owls and bats." Sir A. Layard," A large grey owl is found in great numbers, frequently in flocks of nearly a hundred, in the low shrubs among the ruins of Babylon" ('Nin. and Bab.,' p. 484, note). <span class="cmt_word">Satyrs shall dance there.</span> The word translated "satyr" is, etymologically, "hairy one," and ordinarily means "a goat."  Some have supposed "wild goats" to be here intended, but they are not found in Babylonia. The translation "satyr" is defended by many, who think Isaiah might draw upon current beliefs for some features of his description. Dr. Kay gives "baboons," since the Moko - a kind of baboon - is known in Babylonia.

The destruction of Babylon is to be followed by the restoration of Israel, with the good will of the nations, and by their exercising rule over their late oppressors (vers. 1, 2). In this time of rest and refreshment they will sing a song of triumph over Babylon. The song extends from ver. 4 to ver. 23. It consists of five stanzas, or strophes, each comprising seven long lines, after which there is a brief epode, or epilogue, of a different character. This epode is comprised in vers. 22 and 23. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord will have mercy on Jacob.</span> God's purpose of mercy upon Israel requires, as its preliminary, the destruction of Babylon, and may be considered as the final cause of that destruction. His desire to have mercy on Israel <span class="accented">soon</span> is the reason why the days of Babylon are not prolonged (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-22.htm">Isaiah 13:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Will yet choose Israel</span>. The Captivity was a rejection of Israel from their position as a favored race - God's peculiar people; their restoration was a fresh "choice" of them out of all the nations of the world, a free act of grace on his part; to which they had no claim or right whatsoever. <span class="cmt_word">And set them in their own land;</span> or, <span class="accented">on their own ground</span>. The land that once was theirs, but which they had forfeited by their disobedience, could only become "their own" again by a fresh gift from God. <span class="cmt_word">The strangers shall be joined with them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the stranger shall join himself to them</span>. On the return from the Captivity, there would be an influx of proselytes from the nations, who would voluntarily join themselves to those whom they saw favored both by God and man (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>). Though the Jews did not commonly seek proselytes, they readily received such as offered themselves. A further fulfillment of the prophecy took place when the Gentiles flocked into the Church of God after the coming of Christ.

This can scarcely have been intended literally. The Jews were at no time a conquering people, nor one that set itself to "take captives." The true meaning is that Jewish ideas shall penetrate and subdue the nations generally, and among them those with whom Israel had dwelt as captives. The Jews did become very powerful and numerous both in Assyria and Babylonia about the first century after Christ, and Christian Churches were early formed in Mesopotamia, Adiabene, and even Babylon.

The Hebrew <span class="accented">Sheol</span> corresponded nearly to the Greek Hades, and the Latin <span class="accented">Inferi</span>. It was a dismal region in the center of the earth, whither departed souls descended, and where they remained thenceforth. There were various depths in it, each apparently more dismal than the preceding; but there is no evidence that it was considered to contain any place of happiness, until after the return from the Captivity. The prophet here represents <span class="accented">Sheol</span> as disturbed by the advent of the Babylonian monarch, and as rousing itself to receive him. The great ones of the earth, and the kings, who are kings even in Hades, and sit upon thrones, are especially moved by the occasion, and prepare to meet and greet their brother. Personal identity and continued consciousness of it after death are assumed; and the former earthly rank of the inmates seems to be recognized and maintained. <span class="cmt_word">It stirreth up the dead</span>. Hell in the aggregate  - the place personified - proceeds to arouse the individual inmates, who are called <span class="accented">re-phaim - </span> the word commonly translated "giants" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>, etc.), but meaning properly "feeble ones."

(On the fondness of the Babylonians for music, and the number and variety of their musical instruments, see <a href="../../par/daniel/3-7.htm">Daniel 3:7, 10</a>, etc.) The word here translated "viol" is more commonly rendered "psaltery."

The word translated "Lucifer" means properly "shining one," and no doubt here designates a star; but whether any particular star or no is uncertain. The LXX. translated by <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whence our "Lucifer." The subjoined epithet, "son of the morning" or "of the dawn," accords well with this rendering. <span class="cmt_word">How art thou cut down to the ground!</span> One of Isaiah's favorite changes of metaphor. It is a favorite metaphor also to which he reverts - that of representing the destruction of a nation by the felling of a tree or of a forest (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33, 34</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Which didst weaken the nations</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which didst prostrate the nations</span>.

Isaiah represents rather the thoughts of the Babylonian monarch than his actual words. The Babylonian inscriptions are full of boasting egotism; but they do not contain anything approaching to impiety. The king may regard himself as, in a certain sense, Divine; but still he entertains a deep respect and reverence for those gods whom he regards as the most exalted, as Merodach, Bel, Nebo, Sin, Shamas. He is their worshipper, their devotee, their suppliant (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 111-148). The Babylonian monarchs may have believed that after death they would mount up to heaven and join the "assembly of the great gods" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 83); but we scarcely know enough as yet of the religions opinions of the Babylonians to state positively what their belief was on the subject of a future life. <span class="cmt_word">I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation.</span> The early commentators explained this of Mount Zion, especially on account of the phrase, "<span class="accented">in</span> the sides of the north," which is used of the temple-bill in <a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>. But it is well objected that Mount Zion was a place of no grandeur or dignity or holiness to the Babylonians, who had made it a desolation; and that no Babylonian monarch would have desired to "<span class="accented">sit"</span> there. Moreover, the "mountain" of this passage must be one which is "above the heights of the clouds" and "above the stars of God," which the most imaginative poet could not have said of Mount Zion. A mythic mountain, belonging to the Babylonian theosophy, was therefore seen to be intended, even before the times of cuneiform decipherment (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Michaelis, Knobel). Now that the Babylonian inscriptions can be read, it is found that there was such a mountain, called "<span class="accented">Im-Kharsak</span>," or "<span class="accented">Kharsak-Kurra</span>," which is described as "<span class="accented">the</span> mighty mountain of Bel, <span class="accented">whose head rivals heaven</span>, whose root is the holy deep," and which "<span class="accented">was</span> regarded as the spot where the ark had rested, and where the gods had their seat" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. p. 131, with the comment of Mr. Sayce, p. 130). In Babylonian geography this mountain was identified, either with the peak of Rowandiz, or with Mount Elwend, near Ecbatana. <span class="cmt_word">In the sides of the north</span>. Both El-wend and Rowandiz are situated to the northeast of Babylou - a position which, according to ancient ideas, might be described indifferently as "north" or "east."

It is a mistake to say that "the Assyrians gave the name of God to their monarchs" (Kay), or, at any rate, there is no evidence that they did. Nor does any king, either Assyrian or Babylonian, ever assume a Divine title. There is a marked difference in this respect between the Egyptian and the Assyro-Babylonian religions. Probably Isaiah only means that Babylonian monarchs <span class="accented">thought</span> of themselves as gods, worked their own wills, were wrapped up in themselves, did not in heart bow down to a higher Power.

The long imprisonment of Jehoiachin by Nebuchadnezzar (thirty-six years, <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>) is an illustration; but perhaps it is rather the retention in captivity of the entire Jewish people that is brought to the prophet's cognizance.

The care taken to prepare tombs was not confined to Egypt, though there obtaining its greatest development.

Again "thou" is emphatic. Translate, <span class="accented">But thou - thou art cast out</span>. The Babylonian monarch did not rest in the tomb which he had prepared for himself. His body was "cast out" - left, apparently, where it fell in battle. If there is allusion to any individual, it is probably to Belshazzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Like an abominable branch.</span> As a shoot from a tree, which is disapproved, and so condemned and cut away. <span class="cmt_word">As the raiment of those that are slam</span>. The garments of the slain, soaked in blood (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>), were useless, and were consequently flung away or left to rot uncured for. So was it with the corpse of the great king. <span class="cmt_word">That go down to the stones of the pit</span>. This clause is thought to be misplaced. It deranges the meter and damages the sense. Corpses were not interred on fields of battle in the East (Herod., 3:26). They were left to be "trodden underfoot." It is best, with Ewald and Mr. Cheyne, to transfer the clause to the commencement of the next verse. Thus the fourth stanza is relieved, and the fifth properly filled out.

The meaning is that they shall have no seed, or, if they have any, that it shall be early cut off, and the whole race blotted out. Pretenders rose up under Darius Hystaspis, claiming descent from Belshazzar's father, Nabenidus; but the claim is characterized as false, and a false claim would scarcely have been set up had real descendants survived.

From the  distant prospect of an ultimate deliverance from the power of Babylon, the prophet turns his gaze to a nearer, if not a greater, deliverance. The present enemy is Assyria. It is she who has carried Samaria into captivity, and who now threatens the independence of Judah. Deliverance from her has already been promised more than once (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-19, 25-27, 33, 34</a>); but apparently the people are not reassured - they still dread the foe who is so near, and who seems so irresistible.

The Assyrian yoke, imposed by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-10</a>), and (according to his own inscriptions) again by Sargon, was thrown off by Hezekiah, who "rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>). It was this rebellion that provoked the expedition of Sennacherib, described in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-16</a>; and it may be this rejection of the yoke which is here prophesied.

The Philistines had suffered grievously at the hands of Judah in the reign of Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), and had retaliated in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). It would seem that after this they were invaded by Tiglath-Pileser, who penetrated as far as Gaza, which lie took ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 51) and made tributary, as he also did Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 399). Tiglath-Pileser died shortly before Ahaz, and the present "burden" seems to have been uttered in connection with his death. Isaiah warns Philistia (equivalent to "<span class="accented">Palestina"</span>) that her rejoicing is premature; Tiglath-Pileser will have successors as powerful and as cruel as himself, and these successors will carry destruction and ravage over the whole land. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden</span>.

Isaiah addresses the country as "whole Palestine," because, while it was made up of a number of principalities (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>), his message concerned it in its entirety. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of him that smote thee is broken.</span> This can scarcely refer to the death of Ahaz, since Ahaz did not smite the Philistines, but was smitten by them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>).

He con<span class="accented">quered</span> Ascalon ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 432) and Ekron (ibid., p. 433), and had the kings of Gaze and Ashdod among his tributaries (ibid., p. 438, note 11).

The present chapter and the next are very closely connected, and may be regarded as together constituting "the burden of Moab." It has been argued on critical grounds that the bulk of the prophecy is quoted by Isaiah from an earlier writer, and that he has merely modified the wording and added a few touches here and there (so Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Maurer, Ewald, Knobel, and Cheyne). Jeremiah is thought to have also based his "judgment of Moab" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>.) on the same early writing. But speculations of this kind are in the highest degree uncertain, and moreover lead to no results of the slightest importance. It is best, therefore, to regard Isaiah as the author of these two chapters. Having threatened Philistia, Israel's nearest enemy upon the west, he turns to Moab, her nearest foe towards the east. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. An elliptical beginning. Mr. Cheyne supposes some such words as "Lament for Moab," or "Alas for Moab!" to have been in the writer's mind, but to have been omitted through "lyrical excitement." <span class="cmt_word">In the night</span>. This is best taken literally. Night attacks, though not common in antiquity, were not unknown. Mesha, King of Moab, boasts that he "went in the night" against Nebo, and assaulted it at early dawn (Moabite Stone, I. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Ar of Moab</span>; or, <span class="accented">Ar-Moab</span>. An ancient city, mentioned among those taken from the Moabites by Sihon (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>). According to Jerome, it was called in Roman times Areopolis, or Rabbath-Moab. Modern geographers identify it with <span class="accented">Rabba</span>, a place on the old Roman road between <span class="accented">Kerak</span> and <span class="accented">Arair</span>, south of the Amen, where there are some ancient remains, though they are not very extensive (Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 377). <span class="cmt_word">Is laid waste, and brought to silence</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is stormed</span>, <span class="accented">is ruined</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Kir of Moab</span>.

It was an ancient Moabite town of considerable importance, and has recently been identified with the site called <span class="accented">Diban</span>, where the Moabite Stone was found. This place is situated in the country east of the Dead Sea, about three miles north of the river Arnon, on the old Roman road connecting Rabbath-Moab with Hesh-bob. The town seems to have gained in importance from the fact that it was the birthplace of Chemosh-Gad, Mesha's father (Moabite Stone, 1. 2). Mesha added to its territory (ibid., 1.21). It is extremely probable that it was the site of one of the Moabite "high places," and was therefore naturally one of the places whereto the Moabites, when afflicted, went up" to weep." <span class="cmt_word">Over Nebo, and over Medeba</span>. Nebe and Medeba were also ancient Moabite towns. Nebo is mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 38</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-47.htm">Numbers 33:47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-8.htm">1 Chronicles 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1, 22</a>. It seems to have lain almost midway between Beth-baal-meon (Main) and Medeba, about three or four miles south-east of Heshbon. Medeba obtains notice in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>. Mesha says that it was taken from the Moabites by Omri, King of Israel, but recovered by himself at the end of forty 'years (Moabite Stone, 11. 7-9). It lay south-east of Hesh-ben, at the spot which still retains the old name <span class="accented">- Madeba</span>. It has been suggested that there was at Nebo a shrine of the Baby-Ionian god so named; but this is to assume a resemblance which the facts at present known do not indicate, between the Moabite and Babylonian religions. <span class="cmt_word">On all their heads shall be baldness</span>. The practice of cutting off the hair in mourning was common to the Jews (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-12.htm">Isaiah 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>) with various other nations; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the Persians (Herod., 9:24), the Greeks, the Macedonians (Pint., 'Vit.

The modern wearing of black garments, especially crape, is representative of the old practice. <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall howl</span>. "Howling" remains one of the chief tokens of mourning in the East. It was a practice of the Egyptians (Herod., 2:79), of the Persians (ibid., 8:99; 9:24), of the Babylonians (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>), and probably of the Orientals generally. <span class="cmt_word">Weeping abundantly</span>; or, <span class="accented">running down with tears</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-18.htm">Jeremiah 9:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; Herod., 8:99).

Heshbon, now <span class="accented">Hesban</span>, lay about twenty miles east of the Jordan, nearly on the parallel of its embouchure into the Dead Sea. It was the capital city of Sihon (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21</a>), who took it from the Moabites. On the partition of Palestine among the tribes of Israel, it was assigned to Reuben (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-37.htm">Numbers 32:37</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>); but at a later time we find it reckoned to Gad (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-81.htm">1 Chronicles 6:81</a>). We do not know at what time Moab recovered Heshbon, but may conjecture that it was one of the conquests of Mesha, though it is not mentioned on the Moabite Stone. <span class="cmt_word">And Elealeh</span>. Elealch is commonly united with Heshbon (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-3.htm">Numbers 32:3, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>). It is probably identical with the modern <span class="accented">El-A'al</span>, a ruined town on the top of a rounded hill, little more than a mile north of <span class="accented">Hesban</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Even unto Jahaz</span>. Jahaz lay considerably to the south of Hesh-ben, probably not very far north of the Arnon. It must have been in the vicinity of Dibon, since Mesha, on taking it from the Israelites, annexed it to the territory of that city (Moabite Stone, II. 19-21). It was the scene of the great battle between Sihon and the Israelites under Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-23.htm">Numbers 21:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His life shall be grievous unto him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">his soul shall be grieved within him</span>.

The prophet sympathizes with the sufferings of Moab, as a kindred people (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-37.htm">Genesis 19:37</a>), and perhaps as having, in the person of Ruth, furnished an ancestress to the Messiah (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His fugitives</span>; literally, <span class="accented">her fugitives</span>.

Zoar, the "little" town, spared for Lot's sake (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-20.htm">Genesis 19:20-22</a>), is placed by some at the northern, by others at the southern, extremity of the Dead Sea. The present passage makes in favor of the more southern site.  <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old</span>. Those who defend this rendering refer the simile either to Zest, or to Moab, or to the fugitives. Having regard to the parallel passage of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 48:34), we may pronounce the last explanation to be the best. The resemblance to the heifer will consist in the cries uttered. To ninny critics, however, this idea appears harsh, and the alternative is proposed of regarding <span class="accented">Eglath -</span> the word translated "heifer" - as a place, and the epithet, "of three years <span class="accented">old</span>," as really meaning "the third." Attempts are made to show the existence of three Eglaths in these parts; but they are not very successful; nor is any instance adduced of a city being distinguished from others of the same name by a numerical suffix. The rendering of the Authorized Version may therefore stand, the comparison being regarded as one of the fugitive Moabites to a heifer in its third year, "<span class="accented">rushing</span> along with loud, hopeless bellowings" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">By the mounting up of Luhith</span>. This ascent has not been identified. It should have been on the way from Moab proper to Zoar. <span class="cmt_word">The way of Horonaim</span>. On the Moabite Stone Horonaim is mentioned as a town of the Edomites attacked and taken by Mesha (11:31-33). It lay probably south or southeast of the Dead Sea. The Moabites, flying kern their invaders, seek a refuge in the territories of Edom and Judah, weeping and wailing as they go.

The Wady Numeira is a watercourse running into the Dead Sea from the east, hallway between the promontory called the "Lisan" and the sea's southern extremity.

There is no reason to doubt the identity of this stream with "the waters of Nimrim." Their "desolation" was probably caused by the enemy stopping up the sources (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hay is withered away.</span> There is luxuriant vegetation in the wadys and ghors at the southern end of the Dead Sea, especially in the Ghor-es-Safiyeh, the Wady Numeira, and the Wady el-Mantara ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest.

This portion of the "burden" is divided into three sections. In section 1 (from ver. 1 to the end of ver. 5) an offer of mercy is made to Moab on certain conditions, viz. that she return to her allegiance to the house of David, and show kindness to fugitive Israelites. In section 2 (vers. 6-12) she is supposed to have rejected this offer, and is threatened (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>.) with severe punishment. In section 3 (which consists of vers. 13 and 14) the time is fixed for the main visitation to fall upon her. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lamb of the ruler of the land -</span> the lamb (or lambs, <span class="accented">kar</span> being used collectively) due to the ruler as a mark of subjection. In the time of Ahab Mesha had paid a tribute to Israel of a hundred thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams annually (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The prophet recommends that this, or some similar, tribute should now be paid to the King of Judah instead. Israel having been absorbed into Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">From Sela</span>. Either Moab is regarded as having taken refuge in Edom, and is therefore bidden to send her tribute from the Edomite capital, Sela (equivalent to "Petra"), or "Sela," here is not a proper name, but a collective used to designate the rocky parts of Moab, to which she had betaken herself (as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-28.htm">Jeremiah 48:28</a>). The latter supposition is, on the whole, the more probable. <span class="cmt_word">To the wilderness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wildernesswards</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the way of the wilderness. The enemy being regarded as in possession of the northern end of the Dead Sea, Moab is recommended to send her tribute round the southern end, and so by way of "the wilderness of Judah," to Jerusalem.

Some, however, as Dr. Kay, maintain that the words are the prophet's, addressed to Moab, calling on her to treat kindly fugitives from Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Make thy shadow as the night</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a>).

Delitzsch and Dr. Kay agree with the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">For the extortioner is at an end</span>. This seems to be urged as a reason why the protection asked should be given: it will not be for long - the oppressor is about to receive chastisement. He is called "the extortioner," as exacting the utmost possible tribute from conquered lands. Such exaction was characteristic of Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; 'Assyrian Inscriptions,' <span class="accented">passim</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The spoiler ceaseth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">devastation ceaseth</span>.

"The lords of the heathen" are probably the Assyrians, who made a practice of destroying the fruit trees in an enemy's country, for the mere purpose of doing mischief ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 84). It is wanton to discard this very satisfactory sense for the strange one that "the choice plants have broken <span class="accented">down -</span> i.e., made drunk - the lords of the heathen" (Cheyne).

Sometimes as many as seven persons "trod the wine-press" together (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 45).

The entire area of the region which the Moabites inhabited seems to have been not more than fifteen hundred square miles. The greater part of it was, however, exceedingly fertile; and we are, perhaps, justified in allowing it a population of two hundred to the square mile, which is about that of Germany.

Behold, Damascus is taken away from <i>being</i> a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - THE BURDEN OF DAMASCUS. The eye of the prophet travels northwards from Moab, and, passing over Ammon as an enemy of small account, rests once more upon Damascus, already threatened in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1 - 9</a>, and probably already partially punished. Damascus is seen once more in alliance with Ephraim (ver. 3), and the two are joined with a new power, Aroer (ver. 2), which possesses several "cities." Woe is denounced on all the three powers: desolation on Damascus and Aroer; on Damascus and Ephraim, the complete loss of the last shadow of independence. The Assyrian inscriptions point out, as the probable date of the prophecy, the commencement of Sargun's reign - about  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> or 721. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Damascus is taken away from being a city</span>. According to Vitringa, Damascus has been destroyed oftener than any other town; but it has a wonderful power of rising again from its ashes. Probably a destruction by Sargon is here intended ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 6). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a></div><div class="verse">The cities of Aroer <i>are</i> forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The cities of Aroer are forsaken</span>. That the Aroer of this passage cannot be either that on the Arnon, or that facing Rabbath-Ammon (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), has long been perceived and recognized (see Mr. Grove's article on "Aroer" in the 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 115). It is evidently a city of the same name lying much further towards the north. Arid it is a city of far greater importance, having "cities" dependent on it. Now, Sargon's annals tell us of a "Gal'gar," a name well expressing the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;</span>, which was united in a league with Damascus, Samaria, Arpad, and Simyra, in the second year of Sargon, and was the scene of a great battle and a great destruction. Sargon besieged it, took it, and reduced it to ashes ('Records of the <span class="accented">Past</span>,' 50.<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.). There is every reason to recognize the "Aroer" of this verse in the "Gargar" of Sargon's inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be for flocks</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-17.htm">Isaiah 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-25.htm">Isaiah 7:25</a>). It marked the very extreme of desolation, that cattle should be pastured on the sites of cities. <span class="cmt_word">None shall make them afraid</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "there shall be no inhabitants to make any objection." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/17-3.htm">Isaiah 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim</span>. Sargon did not destroy Samaria on the occasion of his first capture. But he says that he "reduced it to a heap of ruins" on the occasion of its second capture ('Records of the Past,' <span class="accented">l.s</span>.<span class="accented">c</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And the kingdom from Damascus</span>. We do not hear of any King of Damascus after Rezin, who was slain by Tiglath-Pileser about  <span class="date">B.C. 732</span>. Damascus, however, reasserted her independence in  <span class="date">B.C. 721</span>, and probably set up a king at the same time. In  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span> she was reduced and destroyed. Nothing more is heard of her until  <span class="date">B.C. 694</span> - the eleventh year of Sen-nacherib - when her "governor" is Assyrian Eponym, and she must therefore have been absorbed into the Assyrian empire. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Syria</span>. This phrase shows that the great blow which struck down Syria - Tiglath-Pileser's capture of Damascus and slaughter of Rezin - was a thing of the past. Syria was already but "a remnant." Now she was to cease to exist altogether. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be as the glory of the children of Israel</span>. Ironical. The irony is made apparent by the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">And in that day it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-11.</span> - A DENUNCIATION OF WOE ON ISRAEL, COMBINED WITH THE PROMISE OF A REMNANT. Israel, having united herself with Syria to resist the Assyrians, will incur a similar fate. Her glory will decay, her population dwindle and almost disappear. Still there will be a few left, who, under the circumstances, will turn to God (ver. 7). But it will be too late for anything like a national recovery; the laud will remain "a desolation" on account of the past sins of its inhabitants (vers. 9-11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The glory of Jacob shall be made thin</span>. There is reason to believe that the deportation of the Israelites was gradual. Sargon, on taking Samaria for the first time, in  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, carried off no more than 27, 290 of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 125). Over the remainder he appointed governors, and required them to pay the same taxation as before. About  <span class="date">B.C. 715</span> he placed a number of Arabs in Samaria, probably deporting natives to make room for them (ibid., p. 128). The continuant of a remnant of Israelites in the land down to  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span> is indicated by <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The fatness of his flesh shall wax lean</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16</a>). Depopulation is primarily intended; but there is, perhaps, also a more general reference to depression, wasting, and misery. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As when the harvestman gathereth the corn</span>. Death is the "harvestman" here, and gathers the Israelites by shocks, or sheaves, into his garner. A great depopulation appears in <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>, where we learn that lions so multiplied in the land as to become a terror to the few inhabitants. <span class="cmt_word">Reapeth the ears</span>. Mr. Cheyne well remarks that the "ears" only were reaped, the stalk being cut close under the ear. This was the practice also in Egypt (Rawlinson,' Hist. of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 162). <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of Rephaim</span>. The valley of Rephaim was the scene of David's double victory over the Philistines, related in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>. It is disputed whether it lay north or south of Jerusalem; but the connection with Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13-17</a>) and with the cave of Adullam seem decisive in favor of a southern position. A "valley," however ('<span class="accented">emek</span>), suitable for the cultivation of corn, in this direction, has yet to be discovered.

The olive crop was obtained, not by shaking, but by beating the trees (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-20.htm">Deuteronomy 24:20</a>).

We have evidence of this revulsion of feeling on the part of Israel in the statement of Chronicles that, in the reign of Josiah, offerings of money were made for the temple service by men of "<span class="accented">Manasseh</span> and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel," which the Levites collected and brought to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-9.htm">2 Chronicles 34:9</a>).

The altars at Dan and Bethel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>) may be intended, or the Israelites may have had other idolatrous altars besides these (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-11.htm">2 Kings 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>). Josiah, about  <span class="date">B.C. 631</span>, broke down altars throughout all the land of Israel, in the cities of Manasseh and Ephraim and Simeon (?), even unto Naphtali (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5-7</a>). Apparently he had the consent of the inhabitants to this demolition. <span class="cmt_word">Either the groves, or the images</span>, <span class="accented">Asherah</span>, the word here and elsewhere commonly translated "grove" in the Authorized Version, is now generally admitted to have designated an artificial construction of wood or metal, which was used in the idolatrous worship of the Phoenicians and the Israelites, probably as the emblem of some deity. The Assyrian "sacred tree" was most likely an emblem of the same kind, and may give an idea of the sort of object worshipped under the name of Asherah (comp. 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 235-237). The Israelites, in the time of their prosperity, had set up "groves" of this character "on every high hill, and under every green tree" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>). Many of them were still standing when Josiah made his iconoclastic raid into the Israelite country (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5-7</a>), and were broken down by him at the same time as the altars. The "images" of this place are the same as those coupled with the Israelite "groves" in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-7.htm">2 Chronicles 34:7</a>, namely "sun-images," emblems of Baal, probably pillars or conical stones, such as are known to have held a place in the religious worship of Phoenicia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/17-9.htm">Isaiah 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>.

The late repentance of a "remnant" which "looked to their Maker" (ver. 7) could not cancel the long catalogue of former sins (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8-17</a>), foremost among which was their rejection of God, or, at any rate, their complete forgetfulness of his claims upon them. <span class="cmt_word">The Rock of thy strength.</span> God is first called "a Rock" in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4, 15, 18, 30, 31</a>.

Among the later prophets only Habakkuk uses it (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>). Israel, instead of looking to this "Rock," had looked to their rock-fortresses (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dost thou plant</span>, or <span class="accented">hast thou planted</span>. Forgetfulness of Jehovah has led to the adoption of a voluptuous religion - one of debased foreign rites.

"It" must refer to "field" or "garden" understood. The later Israelite religion has been a sort of pleasant garden, planted with exotic slips from various quarters - Phoenicia, Syria, Moab, etc. It has been thought permissible to introduce into it any new cult that took the fancy. Hence the multiplication of altars complained of by Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-11.htm">Hosea 12:11</a>).

This passage is, apparently, out of place. At any rate, it is quite unconnected with what precedes, and almost equally so with what follows. Still, it must be borne in mind that, until the destruction of Sennacherib's army, Isaiah has the thought of the Assyrians, as the pressing danger, always before him, and continually reverts to it, often abruptly, and without preparation (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-26.htm">Isaiah 5:26-30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-17.htm">Isaiah 7:17-25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-5.htm">Isaiah 8:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19, 24-34</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-24.htm">Isaiah 14:24-27</a>). The present prophecy seems, more distinctly than any other in the purely prophetical chapters, to point to the miraculous destruction of the hoot which Sennacherib was about to bring against Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the multitude of many people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho for the tumult of many peoples!</span> The advance of an army composed of soldiers from many nations is descried. They advance with noise and tumult - a tumult compared with that of "seas that are tumultuous." Under the circumstances of the time, it is reasonable to suppose the Assyrians to be intended (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6, 7</a>). The rushing sound of the advance is borne in strongly upon the prophet's mind, and made the subject of three consecutive clauses.

Amid the general excitement caused by the advance of Assyria, Ethiopia also is stirred, and stirred to its furthest limits. The king sends messengers in beats upon the canals and rivers to summon his troops to his standard (vers. 1, 2). The earth stands agaze to see the result of the approaching collision (ver. 3); but God rests calmly in heaven while events are ripening (vers. 4, 5). When the time comes he will strike the blow - Assyria will be given to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field (ver. 6). Then Ethiopia will make an act of homage to Jehovah by the sending of a present to Jerusalem (ver. 7). The time seems to be that immediately preceding the great invasion of Sennacherib (about  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>), when Shabatok the Ethiopian was King of Egypt, and Tirhakah (Tahark) either Crown Prince under him, or more probably Lord Paramount of Egypt over him, and reigning at Napata. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the land</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Ho</span> <span class="accented">for the land!</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-12.htm">Isaiah 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shadowing with wings</span>; literally, either <span class="accented">the land of the shadow of wings</span> or <span class="accented">the land of the noise of wings</span>, most probably the latter. Allusion is thought to be made to the swarms of buzzing flies, especially the tsetse, with which Ethiopia abounds. At the same time, these swarms are, perhaps, intended to be taken as emblems of the hosts of warriors which Ethiopia can send forth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia</span>. The prophet cannot be supposed to have had more than a vague knowledge of African geography. He seems, however, robe aware that Ethiopia is a land of many rivers (see Baker's 'Nile Tributaries'), and he assumes that the dominion of the Ethiopian kings extends even beyond these rivers to the south of them. His object is, as Mr. Cheyne says, "to emphasize the greatness of Ethiopia." It may be questioned, however, whether the dominion of the Ethiopian kings of the time extended so far as he supposed. The seat of their power was Napata, now <span class="accented">Gebel Berkal</span>, in the great bend of the Nile between lat. 18&deg; and 19&deg; N.; and its southern limit was probably Khar-toum and the line of the Blue Nile (see Rawlinson's 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 2. p. 436). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, <i>saying</i>, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That sendeth ambassadors</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">messengers</span>, as the word is translated in <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-9.htm">Isaiah 57:9</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a>. They are sent, apparently, by the king to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">By the sea</span>. "The sea" must in this place necessarily mean the Nile, which is called "the sea" in <a href="../../par/nahum/3-8.htm">Nahum 3:8</a> certainly, and probably in <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-5.htm">Isaiah 19:5</a>. Vessels of papyrus could not possibly have been employed in the very difficult navigation of the Red Sea. <span class="cmt_word">Vessels of bulrushes</span>. That some of the boats used upon the Nile were constructed of the papyrus (which is a sort of bulrush) we learn from Herodotus (it. 96), Theophrastus ('Hist. Plant.,' 4:9), Plutarch ('De Isid. et Osir.,' &sect; 18), Pliny (Hist. 'Nat.,' 6:22), and Lucan ('Pharsal.,' 4:136). They are represented occasionally on the Egyptian monuments. <span class="accented">Saying</span>. This word is interpolated by our translators, and gives a wrong sense. It is the prophet that addresses the messengers, not the king who sends them. <span class="cmt_word">To a nation scattered and peeled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tall and polished</span>, or <span class="accented">tall and sleek</span>. The word translated "scattered" means properly "drawn out," and seems to be applied here to the physique of the Ethiopians, whose stature is said to have been remarkable (Herod., 3:20, 114). The other epithet refers to the glossy skin of the people. <span class="cmt_word">A people terrible from their beginning hitherto</span>; The Israelites first knew the Ethiopians as soldiers when they formed a part of the army brought by Shishak (Sheshonk I.) against Rehoboam, about  <span class="date">B.C. 970</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>). They had afterwards experience of their vast numbers, when Zerah made his attack upon Asa; but on this occasion they succeeded in defeating them (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-13</a>). It was not till about two centuries after this that the power of Ethiopia began to be really formidable to Egypt; and the "miserable Cushites," as they had been in the habit of calling them, acquired the  preponderating influence in the valley of the Nile, and under Piankhi, Shabak, Shabatek, and Tirhakah (Tahark), reduced Egypt to subjection. Isaiah, perhaps, refers to their rise under Piankhi as "their beginning." <span class="cmt_word">A nation meted out and trodden down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a nation of meting out and trampling</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one accustomed to mete out its neighbors' bounds with a measuring-line, and to trample other nations under its feet. <span class="cmt_word">Whose land the rivers have spoiled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">whose land rivers despoil</span>. The deposit of mud, which fertilizes Egypt, is washed by the rivers from Ethiopia, which is thus continually losing large quantities of rich son. This fact was well known to the Greeks (Herod., 2:12, <span class="accented">ad fin</span>.), and there is no reason why Isaiah should not have been acquainted with it.

From exhorting the messengers to hasten on their errand, Isaiah turns to the nations generally, and bids them attend to a coming signal - an ensign is about to be raised, a trumpet is about to be sounded - let them gaze and hearken; the result will be well worth noting. The imagery is not to be taken literally, but in the same way as the notices in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-10.htm">Isaiah 11:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">When he lifteth up an ensign... when he bloweth a trumpet</span>; rather, <span class="accented">when an ensign is lifted</span> up... <span class="accented">when a trumpet sounds</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>On the mountains</span>.

The word <span class="accented">koh</span> is prospective. <span class="cmt_word">I will take my rest, and I will consider</span>; or, I <span class="accented">will be still and look</span> on. The rest of God is contrasted with the bustle and hurry of the Ethiopians and Assyrians. God "sits in his holy seat," calm and tranquil, knowing what the result is about to be, and when it will be; he waits while the influences of heat and moisture, sunshine and dew - his own agencies - ripen Assyria's schemes, impassive, taking no part. Then, suddenly, he takes the part described in the latter portion of ver. 5, "cuts off the shoots and hews down the branches." <span class="cmt_word">Like a clear heat upon herbs</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">while there is clear heat in the sunshine</span>, <span class="accented">while there is a cloud of dew in the harvest-warmth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while surrounding influences are such as must favor the growth of Assyria's power and pride.

The metaphor is slightly varied in this place, to suit the imagery of the preceding clause, where Assyria has been represented as a vine-stock. Formerly her "boughs" were to be "lopped;" now her "branches" and "sprigs" or "sprouts" are to be cut away with pruning-hooks. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/18-6.htm">Isaiah 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall be left together unto the fowls</span>. At length imagery is dropped.

They will furnish food to the beasts and birds of prey for the remainder of the year.

It would not be at all improbable that Tirkakah should, after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, send a gift to the temple of the Jews, either as a recognition of the miracle as wrought by Jehovah, or simply as a thank offering. Necho sent the armor in which he had fought at Megiddo to the temple of Apollo at Branchidae, near Miletus, as a thank offering (Herod., 2:159). We have, however, no historical record of Tirkakah's present as sent. <span class="cmt_word">Of a people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from a people</span> (compare the next clause, which supplies the ellipse of the preposition).

Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-17.</span> - THE BURDEN OF EGYPT. It has been doubted whether this prophecy refers to the conquest of Egypt by Piankhi, as related in the monument which he set up at Napata, or to that by Esarhaddon, of which we gain our knowledge from the inscriptions of his son, Asshur-bani-pal. In the former case, we must suppose it written as early as  <span class="date">B.C. 735</span>; in the latter, its date might be as late as  <span class="date">B.C. 690</span>. The division of Egypt, "kingdom against kingdom," is a circumstance rather in favor of the earlier date; but the "cruel lord," and the mention of the "princes of Zoan and Noph," are decisive for the later. Piankhi is anything rather than a "cruel lord," being particularly mild and clement; Napata (Noph) is under him, and cannot be said to have been "deceived" or to have "seduced Egypt;" and Zoan plays no part in the history of the period. Esarhaddon, on the contrary, was decidedly a "cruel" prince, and treated Egypt with great severity, splitting it up into a number of governments. Zoan was one of the leading cities of the time, and Noph was the leading power on the Egyptian side, the head of the patriotic party which resisted the Assyrian monarch, but to no purpose. We may, therefore, regard this prophecy as one of Isaiah's latest, placed where it is merely on account of its head-tug - the compiler having placed all the "burdens" against foreign countries together. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord rideth upon a swift cloud</span>. Natural imagery to express the rapidity of Divine visitations (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>). God, being about to visit Egypt with a judgment of extreme severity, is represented as entering the land in person (so in <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The idols of Egypt shall be moved.</span> Neither Piankhi nor any other Ethiopian conqueror made war on the Egyptian idols; but the Assyrians were always bent on humbling the gods of the hostile countries (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>). We have no detailed account of Esarhaddon's campaign; but we find Asshur-bani-pal's first victory over Tirhakah immediately followed by the presentation to him in his camp of Egyptian deities (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 20, 1. 1), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of their images. These were probably taken to Nineveh, or else destroyed. At a later date, the same monarch deprived an Egyptian temple of two of its sacred obelisks (ibid., p. 54, 11. 4, 5).

About  <span class="date">B.C. 735</span> a struggle began between Plan-khi, King of Upper Egypt, and Tafnekhf, King of Sais and Memphis, in which the other princes took different sides. Ten or twelve years later there was a struggle between Bocchoris and Sabaeo. From this time onwards, until Psamatik I. reestablished the unity of Egypt (about  <span class="date">B.C. 650</span>), the country was always more or less divided, and on the occurrence of any crisis the princes were apt to make war one up, n another. <span class="cmt_word">Kingdom against kingdom.</span> During the period of disintegration, the title of" king" was assumed by most of the potty princes, though they were little more than chiefs of cities (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 2. p. 100; G.

Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 137-139). In an expedition which he made into Arabia, he slew eight of the sovereigns, two of them being women ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 106, 107). On conquering Egypt he treated it with extreme severity. Not only did he divide up the country into twenty governments, but he changed the names of the towns, and assigned to his twenty governors, as their main duty, that they were "to slay, plunder, and spoil" their subjects (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 37, 1. 7; comp. p. 16, 1. 7). He certainly well deserved the appellations of "a cruel lord," "a fierce king."

The failure might be caused by deficient rains in Abyssinia and Equatorial Africa, producing an insufficient inundation.

Fishing with a hook was practiced in Egypt, though not very widely, except as an amusement by the rich. Actual hooks have been found, not very different from modern ones (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 506), and representations of angling occur in some of the tombs.

Zoan, or Tanis, which had been an insignificant city since the time of the shepherd-kings, came to the front once more at the time of the struggle between Egypt and Assyria. Esarhaddon made it the head of one of the petty kingdoms into which he divided Egypt (G. Smith, 'History of Asshur-bani-pal,' p. 21, 1. 2). Early in the reign of his son it revolted, in conjunction with Sais and Mendes, but was ere long reduced to subjection by the Assyrians. Its king, Petu-bastes, was taken to Nineveh, and there probably put to death. Its "princes" were, no doubt, among those who counseled resistance to Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">The counsel of the wise</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">as for the wise coun-sellers of Pharaoh</span>, <span class="accented">their counsel is become senseless</span>.

The two are parts of one scheme of things, and belong in the prophet's mind to one time. <span class="cmt_word">Shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan</span>. It is quite true, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, that the Eastern Delta was from a very early date continually more and more Semitized by an influx of settlers from Palestine, and that Egyptian literature bears strong marks of this linguistic influence. But this is scarcely what the prophet intends to speak about. He is not interested in philology. What he means is that there will be an appreciable influx into Egypt of Palestinian ideas, thoughts, and sentiments. "Five" is probably used as a "round" number. The first manifest fulfillment of the prophecy was at the foundation of Alexandria, when the Jews were encouraged to become settlers by the concession of important privileges (Josephus, 'Contr. Ap.,' 2:4), and where they ultimately became the predominant element in the population, amounting, according to Philo ('In Flaec.,' &sect; 6), to nearly a million souls. The next great Palestinian influx was under Ptolemy YI. (Philometor), when Onias fled from Palestine with a number of his partisans, and obtained permission to erect a Jewish temple near Heliopelis. The site of this temple is probably marked by the ruins at Tel-el-Yahoudeh ('Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for July, 1880, pp. 137-139). It seems to have been a center to a number of Jewish communities in the neighborhood. In this double way Jehovah became known to Egypt before Christianity. A Christian Church was early established in Alexandria, possibly by St. Mark. <span class="cmt_word">Swear to the Lord of hosts</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "swear fidelity to him." <span class="cmt_word">One shall be called, The city of destruction</span>. Some manuscripts read '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-Kheres</span>, "City of the Sun," for '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span>, "City of Destruction," in which case the reference would be plainly to Heliopelis, which was in the immediate neighborhood of Tel-el-Yahoudeh, and which in the Ptolemaic period may well have fallen under Jewish influence. Even <span class="accented">if </span> '<span class="accented">Ir-ha-heres</span> stand as the true reading, the name may still have been given with allusion to Heliopolis, the prophet intending to say, "That city which was known as the City of the Sun-God shall become known as the City of Destruction of the Sun-God and of idolatrous worship generally." That Heliopolis did actually fall under Jewish influence in the Ptolemaic period appears from a remarkable passage of Polyhistor, who says of the Exodus and the passage of the Red Sea, "The Memphites say that Moses, being well acquainted with the district, watched the ebb of the tide, and so led the people across the dry bed of the sea; but <span class="accented">they of Heliopolis</span> affirm that the king, at the head of a vast force, and having the sacred animals also with him, pursued after the Jews, because they were carrying away with them the riches which they had borrowed from the Egyptians. Then, "<span class="accented">they say</span>," the voice of God commanded Moses to smite the sea with his rod, and divide it; and Moses, when he heard, touched the water with it, and so the sea parted asunder, and the host marched through on dry ground." Such an account of the Exodus would scarcely have been given by Egyptians unless they were three parts Hebraized.

An altar to the Lord was undoubtedly erected by Onias in the temple which he obtained leave to build from Ptolemy Philometor.

But this would be a pillar of witness (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>), and would mark that the land was Jehovah's.

The phraseology resembles that of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-16.htm">Isaiah 11:16</a>; but the purpose is different. Then the "highway" was to facilitate the return of the Israelites to their own land. Now the object is perfectly free communication between the three peoples. <span class="cmt_word">The Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</span> "Shall serve" means "shall worship" (see ver. 21). The "Assyrians" represent the inhabitants of the Mesopotamian regions generally. As, from the time of Alexander, Hebrew influence extended itself largely over Egypt, so, even from an earlier date, it began to be felt in the Mesopotamian countries. The transplantation of the ten tribes, or a considerable portion of them, into Upper Mesopotamia and Media, was the commencement of a diffusion of Hebrew ideas through those regions. The captivity of Judah still further impressed these ideas on the native races. Great numbers of Jews did not return from the Captivity, but remained in the countries and cities to which they had been trans ported, particularly in Babylon (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). The policy of the Seleucid princes was to establish Jewish colonies in all their great cities. In the time between Alexander and the birth of our Lord, the Hebrew community was re cognized as composed of three great sections - the Palestinian, the Egyptian, and the Syro-Babylonian. Constant communication was maintained between the three branches. Ecclesiastical regulations, framed at Jerusalem, were transmitted to Alexandria and Babylon, while collections made in all parts of Egypt and Mesopotamia for the temple service were annually carried to the Palestinian capital by trusty persons. It is thus quite reasonable to regard as an "initial stage in the fulfillment of this prophecy" the state of things existing at this period (Kay). The more complete fulfillment was doubtless after Pentecost, when Christianity was preached and established in Egypt and Libya on the one hand, in Parthia, and Media, and Elam, and Mesopotamia on the other (<a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9, 10</a>).

Judaean monotheism, upheld by God's people in Palestine, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, would be a blessing, not only to those three countries, but to the world at large. So, and still more, would Christianity.

The three countries are able to be a blessing to the world at large, because God's blessing rests upon them. <span class="cmt_word">Egypt my people</span>. Egypt's great work in Jewish times, by which she became a blessing to the world, was her translation of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, commanded by Egyptian kings, and executed at Alexandria, the Egyptian capital. Neo-Platonism certainly owed much to this source. Stoicism probably something. <span class="cmt_word">Assyria the work of my hands</span>. Assyria did no such work as Egypt. Neither the Targum of Onkelos nor the Babylonian Talmud can be compared for a moment with the Septuagint. Still the Mesopotamian Jews were a blessing to their neighbors. They kept alive in the East the notion of one true and spiritual God; they elevated the tone of men's thoughts; they were a perpetual protest against idolatry, with all its horrors. They, no doubt, prepared the way for that acceptance of Christianity by large masses of the population in Syria, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, and even in Persia, of which we have evidence in the ecclesiastical history of the first seven centuries. <span class="cmt_word">Israel mine inheritance</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 18"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 20"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/1.htm"><title>Isaiah 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../songs/8.htm" title="Song of Solomon 8">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 1 <a href="../isaiah/2.htm" title="Isaiah 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - TITLE OF THE WORK. It is questioned whether the title can be regarded as Isaiah's, or as properly belonging to the work, and it is suggested that it is rather a heading invented by a collector who brought together into a volume such prophecies of Isaiah as were known to him, the collection being a much smaller one than that which was made ultimately. In favor of this view it is urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the prophecies, as we have them, do not all "concern Judah and Jerusalem;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is a mistake in the title, which Isaiah could not have made, none of the prophecies belonging to the reign of Uzziah. But it may be answered, that, in the scriptural sense, <span class="accented">all</span> and Jerusalem, prophecy "concerns Judah and Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the people and city of God; and, further, that it is quite impossible to prove that no part of the "vision" was seen in the reign of Uzziah. There are no means of knowing whether Isaiah collected his prophecies into a volume himself or whether the collection was the work of others. In either case, the existing title must be regarded as designed for the entire work. All the earlier prophecies - those of Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, and Zephaniah - have some title introducing them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>). The term is probably used in a collective sense, but is also intended to suggest the intrinsic unity of the entire body of prophecies put forth by Isaiah. As prophets were originally called "seers" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>), so prophecy was called "vision;" and this latter use continued long after the other (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-15.htm">1 Chronicles 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Isaiah the son of Amoz</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-1.htm">Isaiah 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-2.htm">Isaiah 37:2</a>; etc.; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-32.htm">2 Chronicles 32:32</a>). The signification of the name <span class="accented">Isaiah</span> is "the salvation of Jehovah." The name Amen (<span class="accented">Amots</span>) is not to be confused with Amos ('<span class="accented">Amos</span>), who seems to have been a contemporary (<a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</span> The prophecies of Isaiah concern primarily the kingdom of Judah, not that of Israel. They embrace a vast variety of nations and countries (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13, 15</a>. - 21, 23, 47.); but these nations and countries are spoken of "only because of the relation in which they stand to Judah and Jerusalem" (Kay), or at any rate to the people of God, symbolized under those names. Jerusalem occupies a prominent place in the prophecies (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. 1-8; 31:4-9, etc<span class="cmt_word">.). In the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah.</span> Uzziah (or Azariah, as he is sometimes called) reigned fifty-two years - probably from  <span class="date">B.C. 811</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>; Jotham sixteen years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span>; Ahaz also sixteen years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 743</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>; and Hezekiah twenty-nine years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 727</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Isaiah probably prophesied only in the later years of Uzziah, say from  <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>; but as he certainly continued his prophetical career tin Sennacherib's invasion of Judaea (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-5.htm">Isaiah 37:5</a>), which was not earlier than  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, he must have exercised the prophet's office for at least fifty-six years. The lowest possible estimate of the duration of his ministry is forty-seven years  - from the last year of Uzziah,  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, to the fourteenth of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-5.htm">Isaiah 38:5</a>). The highest known to us is sixty-four years  - from the fourth year before Uzziah's death ( <span class="date">B.C. 762</span>) to the last year of Hezekiah ( <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>).

The groundwork of Isaiah's entire prophecy is Judah's defection from God. God's people have sinned, done amiss, dealt wickedly. The hour of vengeance approaches. Punishment has begun, and will go on, continually increasing in severity. National repentance would avert God's judgments, but the nation will not repeat. God's vengeance will fall, and by it a remnant will be purified, and return to God, and be his true people. In the present section the indictment is laid. Judah's sins are called to her remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth</span>. "A grave and magnificent exorilium! All nature is invoked to hear Jehovah make complaint of the ingratitude of his people" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The invocation is cast in the same form with that so common in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 4:26; 30:19; 31:28; 32:1), and seems to indicate familiarity with that book. The idea extends widely among sacred and other poets (see <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-1.htm">Micah 6:1, 2</a>; Aesch., 'P.

The speech of Jehovah follows in vers. 2, 3. <span class="cmt_word">I have nourished and brought up children</span>; literally, (<span class="accented">my</span>) <span class="accented">sons I have made great and high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have raised Israel to greatness and exalted him among the nations. Notwithstanding their disobedience, God still acknowledges them as his "sons." <span class="cmt_word">They have rebelled against me.</span> The verb used is generally rendered in our version "transgressed" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-13.htm">Hosea 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>); but it may also have the stronger sense here assigned it. Lowth translates, "revolted from me;" Gesenius, "fallen away from me;" Cheyne, "broken away from me."

Yet even they recognize their owner or master. Jeremiah contrasts the brutish stupidity of Israel with the wise instinct of animals that have not been domesticated, as the stork, the turtle-dove, the crane, and the swallow (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Israel doth not know;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> does not acknowledge its Master and Owner, pays him no respect, does not recognize him as either Owner or Master. <span class="cmt_word">My people.</span> Compare the formula, so frequent in Exodus, "Let <span class="accented">my people</span> go" (Exodus 7:16; 8:1, 20; 9:1, etc.). Israel was God's people by election (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>), by covenant (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>), by pardoning grace (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12-17</a>). Despite all their backslidings, he had not yet cast them off. They are still "his people" in Isaiah from first to last, standing in contrast with "the nations, "or "the Gentiles, "among whom they are to be "set as a sign" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-19.htm">Isaiah 66:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Doth net consider.</span> Gesenius translates, "doth not consider <span class="accented">thereof</span>;" Cheyne, "is without understanding." Bishop Lowth retains the words of the Authorized Version. The meaning would seem to be, "My people doth not consider <span class="accented">me</span>, cloth not reflect on my relation to them as Lord and Master."

The prophet, having delivered God's message in vers. 2 and 3, proceeds to impress and enforce it on the people by remarks of his own. He begins with a lamentation over their wickedness and impenitence; "Ah sinful nation!" or "Alas for the sinful nation!

Knobel supposes the Edomites and Philistines, who invaded Judaea in the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17, 18</a>), to be intended; Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests the Israelites under Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21-24</a>); while Mr. Cheyne supposes the devastation to have been wrought by the Assyrians under Sargon. If we could be assured that the prophecies of Isaiah are arranged in chronological order, we should either have to accept Rosenm&uuml;ller's view, or to suppose some invasion of Judaea to have taken place in the later years of Uzziah of which no mention is made by the authors of Kings and Chronicles; but it is impossible to be certain on what principle Isaiah's prophecies are arranged. The mention of "strangers" is in favor of the enemy having been actual foreigners, and therefore not the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Your cities are burned with fire.</span> The common fate of cities taken in war. In the Assyrian sculptures we often see the torch applied to them. <span class="cmt_word">Your land.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, "your <span class="accented">tillage</span>." <span class="accented">Adamah</span> means "soil" or "ground" generally; but here no doubt denotes the ground which bore crops. <span class="cmt_word">Strangers devour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "foreigners" others than the sons of the soil - not necessarily persons of a different race, but still probably such persons. <span class="cmt_word">In your presence</span>; before your eyes, as you look on - an aggravation of the affliction. It is <span class="cmt_word">desolate, as overthrown by strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it is a desolation</span>, <span class="accented">like an overthrow by strangers</span>. The near approach to repetition displeases moderns, who conjecture <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that <span class="accented">zarim</span>, strangers, has another meaning, and should be here translated by "inundation" or "deluge" (Aben Ezra, Michaelis, Lowth); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a wrong reading, and should  Be altered into <span class="accented">sodim</span>, a word not <span class="accented">very</span> different (Ewald, Cheyne). But "the return to words whose sounds are yet lingering in the ear" is characteristic of ancient writing, and a favorite practice of Isaiah's (Kay). The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore stand.

Vineyards required to be watched for a few weeks only as the fruit began to ripen; and the watchers, or keepers, built themselves, therefore, mere "booths" for their protection (<a href="../../par/job/27-18.htm">Job 27:18</a>). These were frail, solitary dwellings - very forlorn, very helpless. Such was now Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.</span> Cucumber-gardens required watching throughout the season, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from spring to autumn, and their watcher needed a more solid edifice than a booth.

The "remnant" is that of the few godly men who still inhabit Jerusalem. The comparison of Jerusalem with Sodom is made again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>, and is carried out at some length by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-44.htm">Ezekiel 16:44-57</a>).

The prophet supposes the people, by the mouth of their rulers, to meet the charge of rebellion with an appeal to the fact that they maintain all the outward ordinances of religion, as required by the Lawn and are therefore blameless. This draws from him a burst of indignant eloquence, which the Holy Spirit directs him to put, mainly, into the mouth of God (vers. 11-15), denouncing such a pretence of religion as an aggravation of their sin, and characterizing their whole worship as an "abomination." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Do not <span class="accented">speak to</span> no purpose, but hear." The rulers are supposed to have begun their plea, but the prophet stops them. <span class="cmt_word">Ye rulers of Sodom.</span> Having said in the preceding verse how nearly Jerusalem had suffered the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, the writer grows more bold, and proceeds to give Jerusalem the obnoxious names. Her "rulers, "literally, <span class="accented">judges</span> (<span class="accented">katsin</span> in Hebrew corresponding to <span class="accented">kadi</span> in Arabic), are "rulers of Sodom;" her people are the "people of Gomorrah." There is as much wickedness, though it may be not the same wickedness, in "the daughter of Zion" at the existing time, as in the cities of the plain when God destroyed them. <span class="cmt_word">The law of our God.</span> Not the Levitical Law, though the word used has generally that sense, but the "instruction" or "direction" that was about to be uttered (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>; and see below, <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a> and Isaiah 51:4).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">To what purpose <i>is</i> the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?</span> <span class="accented">Cui bono?</span> What good end do they serve? "Thinkest thou that I will eat the flesh of bulls, and drink the blood of goats? "(Psalm 1:13). God "delights not in burnt offerings." From the time of Samuel he had declared, "Behold, to obey is better then sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). David had said of him, "Sacrifice and meat offering thou wouldest not; burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin hast thou not required" (<a href="../../par/psalms/40-8.htm">Psalm 40:8, 9</a>); and again, "I will not reprove thee because of thy sacrifices, or for thy burnt offerings, because they were not always before me. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he-goat out of thy folds; for all the beasts of the forest are mine, and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills" (<a href="../../par/psalms/50-8.htm">Psalm 50:8-10</a>). Not, of course, that either David or Isaiah desired to abolish sacrifice, or had any commission so to do; but they were, both of them, anxious to impress on men that sacrifice, <span class="accented">by itself</span>, was nothing - that self-dedication, self-renunciation, true devotion of the heart, with its necessary concomitant obedience, must accompany sacrifice, for God to be pleased therewith. The sacrifices of a people such as is described in vers. 21-23 could not but be an offence to him. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> The phrase employed is unusual, and almost confined to Isaiah, occurring elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>. Isaiah uses it again in ver. 18, and also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21</a>; and Isaiah 66:9. It is explained to be emphatic, implying that this is what God says, and will say,  concerning the matter in hand, once and forever (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">I am full of the burnt offerings of rams</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I am overfull</span>, <span class="accented">satiated</span>, <span class="accented">wearied with them</span>. Barns formed a part of the required sacrifice on all great occasions, as at the Passover (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19</a>), at the Feast of Weeks (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-27.htm">Numbers 28:27</a>), at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 36</a>), at the Feast of Trumpets (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2</a>), and on the great Day of Atonement (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-8.htm">Numbers 29:8</a>). They were commanded as the sole sacrifice for a trespass offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/5-16.htm">Leviticus 5:16, 18</a>). Under David were offered on one occasion "a thousand rams" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-21.htm">1 Chronicles 29:21</a>); and the occasions where seven rams formed the legitimate sacrifice were many. Unaccompanied by a proper frame of mind, each such offering was an offence to God, displeased him, wearied him. <span class="cmt_word">The fat of fed beasts.</span> The fat was always regarded, both by the Hebrews and the Greeks, as especially suitable for sacrifice. It was burnt upon the altar in every case, even where the greater part of the victim was consumed as food (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-3.htm">Leviticus 3:3, 10</a>, etc.; note particularly the expression in <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>, "All the fat is the Lord's"). "Fed beasts" are those which were kept separate in stalls or sheds for some time before the sacrifice, and given food in which there was nothing" unclean." The Paschal lambs were required to be thus separated and fed for four days (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3, 6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I delight not in the blood.</span> The blood, "which is the life" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a>), was to be sprinkled on the altar in every sacrifice of a victim. This sprinkling was of the very essence of the sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-6.htm">Leviticus 4:6, 17, 25, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Bullocks... lambs... he-goats.</span> These, together with rams, constituted all the sacrificial beasts of the Hebrews.

The requirement of the Law was still observed in the letter, but not in the <span class="cmt_word">spirit</span>. They came with no true religious object. Hence the question which follows: <span class="cmt_word">Who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</span> <span class="accented">This</span> was not what God had enjoined - a mere bodily attendance, a <span class="accented">trampling</span> of his courts with their feet, when their hearts were far from him.

But incense symbolized prayer (<a href="../../par/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>); and if no heartfelt prayer accompanied its use, it was emptied of all its significance, and became hateful to God - a <span class="accented">mere</span> form, and consequently an "abomination." <span class="cmt_word">The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with</span>. The weekly festival of the sabbath, the monthly one of the "new moon, "and the annual "assemblies" or "solemn feasts" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>), were the main occasions of Jewish worship. As at this time conducted, God could endure none of them; all were tainted with the prevalent unreality. The construction of the passage is highly rhetorical, and indicates great excitement of feeling. Kay translates it literally, "New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot - it is ungodliness - even the solemn meeting." The authors of the Revised Version also suppose an aposiopesis. <span class="cmt_word">The solemn meeting.</span> The word thus translated is applied only to particular days in the great festival seasons, as to the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>), and the seventh day of the Passover (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a>), or else to days specially appointed for religious services by civil authority (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-9.htm">2 Chronicles 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>).

But cruelty and oppression, producing poverty and wretchedness, and tending to shorten life, are no doubt also included (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10, 11</a>).

God, having put aside the worthless plea of outward religiousness made by his people, goes on to declare, by the mouth of his prophet, what he requires. First, in general terms (ver. 16), and then with distinct specification (ver. 17), he calls on them to amend their ways, both negatively ("cease to do evil") and positively ("learn to do well"). If they will really amend, then he assures them of forgiveness and favor; if they refuse and continue their rebellion, the sword will devour them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wash you, make you clean</span>. The analogy of sin to defilement, and of washing to cleansing from sin, has been felt among men universally wherever there has been any sense of sin. Outward purification by water has been constantly made use of as typical of the recovery of inward purity. Hence the numerous washings of the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-4.htm">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-7.htm">Numbers 19:7, 8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>; etc.); hence the ablutions of the priests in Egypt (Herod., 2:37); hence the appropriateness of the rite of baptism; hence the symbolical washing of hands to free from complicity in blood-guiltiness (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a>). "Wash you, make you clean, "could not be misunderstood by the Israelites; they would know that it was a requirement to "wash their hands in innocency" (<a href="../../par/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>), even apart from what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes.</span> Not "hide it, "for that was impossible; but remove it altogether - in other words, "cease from it."

The Assyrian inscriptions enable us to date this prophecy with a near approach to exactness. Ashdod was besieged by an Assyrian army twice in the reign of Sargon - in his ninth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 713</span>) and in his eleventh year ( <span class="date">B.C. 711</span>). On the former occasion it is probable that the arms of a general (Tartan) were employed; on the latter it is nearly certain that Sargon made the expedition in person. The capture of Ashdod, here mentioned, is consequently the first capture. Egypt and Ethiopia were at the time united under one head, Shabak, or Shabatok; and the inhabitants of Ashdod looked to this quarter for deliverance from the Assyrian power. Shortly after the first capture, they revolted, deposed the king whom Sargon had set over them, appointed another, and then proceeded, in conjunction with Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, to call in the aid of the Egyptians and Ethiopians. Isaiah's mission on this occasion was to discourage Judaea from joining Ashdod and her allies in this appeal. He was instructed to prophesy that Assyria would shortly inflict a severe defeat on the two African powers, and carry into captivity large numbers of both nations. The prophecy seems to have had its accomplishment about twelve years later, when Sennacherib defeated the combined forces of Egypt and Ethiopia at Eltekeh, near Ekron (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 133). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">tartan</span>. The word was not a proper name, but a title of office, equivalent to <span class="accented">surena</span> among the Parthians, and signifying "commander-in-chief." The tartan held the second position in the empire. Isaiah has been accused of having confounded together the two sieges of Ashdod (Cheyne); but if one was conducted by the tartan, and the other by Sargon in person, his words would distinguish as perfectly as possible which siege he meant. <span class="cmt_word">When Sargon the King of Assyria sent him</span>. The present passage furnished almost the sole trace of the existence of this monarch - one of the greatest of Assyria's sovereigns - until about the middle of the present century, when the exploration of the Assyrian ruins, and the decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions, presented him to us in the most distinct and vivid way, as king, conqueror, and builder. He was the founder of the last and greatest of the Assyrian dynasties, the successor of the biblical Shalmaneser, and the father of Sennacherib. He reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>. He was the captor of Samaria; he defeated the forces of Egypt; he warred on Susiana, Media, Armenia, Asia Minor, Cyprus; and he conquered and held in subjection Babylon. He built the great city explored by M. Botta, near Khorsabad, which is sometimes called "the French Nineveh." It is now found that Ptolemy's 'Canon' contains his name under the form of Arkeanus, and that Yacut's 'Geography' mentions his great city under the form of Sarghun. But these facts were unsuspected until the recent explorations in Mesopotamia, and Isaiah's mention of him alone gave him a place in history. <span class="cmt_word">And fought against Ashdod, and took it</span>. Ashdod was the strongest of the Philistine cities, and one of the most ancient (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>). Its name is probably derived from a root meaning "strength." We hear of its having stood on one occasion a siege of twenty-nine years (Herod., 2:157). It is now known as <span class="accented">Esdud</span>. When Ashdod is first mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions it is tributary to Sargon, having probably submitted to him in s c. 720, alter the battle of Raphia. It soon, however, revolts and reclaims its independence. In  <span class="date">B.C. 713</span> the Assyrians proceed against it; and its capture is implied by the facts that the <span class="accented">Assyrians</span> depose its king, and install, one of his brothers as monarch in his room (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>).

Dr. Kay supposes that Isaiah was wearing sackcloth exceptionally, as during a time of mourning.

Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130). It has been proposed, by an arbitrary emendation, to cut down the time to "three days;" but a three days' sign of the kind could not have been expected to have any important effect. The supposed "impropriety" of Isaiah's having "gone naked and barefoot" for three years arises from a misconception of the word "naked." which is not to be taken literally (see the comment on ver. 2). The costume adopted would be extraordinary, especially in one of Isaiah's rank and position; but would not be in any degree "improper." It would be simply that of working men during the greater part of the day (see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26, 27</a>).

The intermixture of young and old, of full-grown males with women leading children by the hand or carrying them upon the shoulder, in the Assyrian sculptures, strikes us even on the most cursory inspection of them. <span class="cmt_word">Naked and barefoot</span>. Assyrian captives are ordinarily represented "barefoot." Most commonly they wear a single tunic, reaching from the neck to the knees, or sometimes to the ankles, and girt about the waist with a girdle. It is probable that Egyptian and Ethiopian prisoners would be even more scantily clad, since the ordinary Egyptian tunic began at the waist and ended considerably above the knee.

As whirlwinds in the south pass through; <i>so</i> it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - THE BURDEN OF THE DESERT OF THE SEA. This is a short and somewhat vague, but highly poetic, "burden of Babylon" It is probably an earlier prophecy than <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. and 14, and perhaps the first revelation made to Isaiah with respect to the fall of the great Chaldean capital. It exhibits no consciousness of the fact that Babylon is Judah's predestined destroyer, and is expressive rather of sympathy (vers. 3, 4) than of triumph. Among recent critics, some suppose it to refer to Sargon's capture of the city in  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>; but the objection to this view, from the entire absence of all reference to Assyria as the conquering power, and the mention of "Elam" and "Media" in her place, is absolutely fatal to it. There can be no reasonable doubt that the same siege is intended as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>, where also Media is mentioned (ver. 17); and there are no real grounds for questioning that the event of which the prophet is made cognizant is that siege and capture of Babylon by Cyrus the Great which destroyed the Babylonian empire. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The desert of the sea</span>. The Isaianic authorship of this title is doubtful, since "the desert of the sea" is an expression elsewhere wholly unknown to biblical writers. Some regard "the sea" as the Euphrates, in which case "the desert of the sea" may be the waste tract west of the Euphrates, extending thence to the eastern borders of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">As whirlwinds in the south pass through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as whirlwinds in the south country</span>, <span class="accented">sweeping along</span>. The "south country" is that immediately to the south of Judaea. Its liability to whirlwinds is noticed in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a> and in <a href="../../par/job/37-9.htm">Job 37:9</a> (compare Major Palmer's 'Sinai,' p. 33). <span class="cmt_word">It cometh</span>. What cometh? Dr. Kay says, "God's visitation;" Rosenm&uuml;ller, "a numerous army." But is it not rather the "grievous vision" of the next verse? <span class="cmt_word">From the desert.</span> The <span class="accented">great</span> desert bounding Palestine on the east - a truly "terrible land." Across this, as coming from Baby-Ionia to Palestine, seemed to rush the vision which it was given to the prophet to see. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A grievous vision</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">hard vision</span>; not, however, "hard of interpretation" (Kay), but rather "hard to be borne," "grievous," "calamitous." <span class="cmt_word">The treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">the robber robs</span> (Knobel); or, <span class="accented">the violent man uses violence</span> (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The idea of faithlessness passes out of the Hebrew <span class="accented">boged</span> occasionally, and is unsuitable here, more especially if it is the army of Cyrus that is intended. <span class="cmt_word">Go up,</span> <span class="cmt_word">O Elam</span>. The discovery that Cyrus, at the time of his conquest of Babylon, Bore the title of "King of Ansan," not "King of Persia," coupled with the probability that "Ansan" was a part of Elam, lends a peculiar interest to these words. Isaiah could not describe Cyrus as "King of Persia," and at the same time be intelligible to his contemporaries, since Persia was a country utterly unknown to them. In using the term "Elam" instead, he uses that of a country known to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>), adjoining Persia, and, at the time of his expedition against Babylon, subject to Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Besiege, O Media</span>. Having given "Elam" the first place, the prophet assigns to Media the second. Eleven years before he attacked Babylon, Cyrus had made war upon Astyages (Istuvegu), King of the Medes, had captured him, and become king of the nation, with scarcely any opposition (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus'). Hence the Medes would naturally form an important portion of the force which he led against Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">All the sighing thereof have I made to cease</span>. The "sighing" caused by Babylon to the nations, to the captives, and to the kings whose prison-doors were kept closed (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>), God has in his counsels determined to bring to an end.

The prophet is horrorstruck at the vision shown him - at the devastation, the ruin, the carnage (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-18.htm">Isaiah 13:18</a>). He does not stop to consider how well deserved the punishment is; he does not, perhaps, as yet know how that, in smiting Babylon, God will be specially avenging the sufferings of his own nation (see the introductory paragraph). <span class="cmt_word">I was bowed down at the hearing</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I am so agonized that I cannot hear</span>; <span class="accented">I am so terrified that I cannot see</span>.

He uses historical infinitives, the most lively form of narrative. Translate, <span class="accented">They deck the table</span>, <span class="accented">set the watch</span>, <span class="accented">eat</span>, <span class="accented">drink</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> having decked the table, they commit the task of watching to a few, and then give themselves up to feasting and reveling, as if there were no danger. It is impossible not to think of Belshazzar's feast, and the descriptions of the Greek historians (Herod., 1:191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:23), which mark at any rate the strength of the tradition that, when Babylon was taken, its inhabitants were engaged in revelry. <span class="cmt_word">Arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</span> In the midst of the feast there enters to the revellers one from the outside, with these words, "Rise, quit the banquet; get your shields; anoint them; arm yourselves." That shields were greased with fat or oil before being used in battle appears from Virg., 'AEneid,' 7:625, and other places. It was thought that the enemy's weapons would more readily glance off an oiled surface. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a></div><div class="verse">For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, set a watchman</span>. The event is not to be immediate, it is to be watched for; and Isaiah is not to watch himself, but to set the watchman. Moreover, the watchman waits long before he sees anything (ver. 8). These unusual features of the narrative seem to mark a remote, not a near, accomplishment of the prophecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he saw a chariot <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, <i>and</i> a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he saw... he hearkened</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall see</span>... he <span class="accented">shall hearken</span> (Kay). He is to wait and watch until he sees a certain sight; then he is to listen attentively, and he will hear the crash of the falling city. <span class="cmt_word">A chariot with a couple of horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a troop of horsemen riding two and two</span>. This is exactly how a cavalry force was ordinarily represented by the Assyrians. Chariots are not intended either here or in ver. 9. They were not employed by the Persians until a late period of their history (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. pp. 113, 122). <span class="cmt_word">A chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels</span>; rather, <span class="accented">men mounted on asses and on camels</span>. It is well known that both animals were employed by the Persians in their expeditions to carry the baggage (Herod., 1:80; 4:129; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:1, etc.). But neither animal was ever attached to a chariot. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/21-8.htm">Isaiah 21:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, A lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he cried as a lion</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with a loud deep voice (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/10-3.htm">Revelation 10:3</a>). The watchman, after long waiting, becomes impatient, and can contain himself no longer. He makes complaint of his long vain watch. <span class="cmt_word">My lord</span>; rather, O <span class="accented">Lord</span>. The watchman addresses his complaint to Jehovah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/21-9.htm">Isaiah 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, <i>with</i> a couple of horsemen.

But they are better taken as the prophet's statement of a fact, "And behold, just then there cometh a troop of men, riding two and two" - the sign for which he was to watch (ver. 7), or rather the first part of it. We must suppose the rest of the sign to follow, and the watchman then to listen awhile attentively. Suddenly he hears the sound of a sacked town, and he exclaims, <span class="cmt_word">Babylon is fallen, is fallen</span>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">All the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</span> Recent documents, belonging to the time of Cyrus, and treating of his capture of Babylon, show that this expression is not to be understood literally. Cyrus was not an iconoclast; he did not break into pieces, or in any way destroy or insult the Babylonian idols. On the contrary, he maintained them in their several shrines, or restored them where they had been displaced; he professed himself a worshipper of the chief Babylonian gods - Bel, Nebo, and Merodach - he repaired the temple of Merodach; he prayed to Bel and Nebo to lengthen his days; he caused his son, Cambyses, to take part in the great religious ceremony wherewith the Babylonians opened the new year. Thus his conquest of Babylon did not bring upon its gods a physical, but only a moral, destruction. The Persian victory discredited and degraded them. It proclaimed to Western Asia that the idolatrous system so long prevalent in the region between Mount Zagros and the Mediterranean was no longer in the ascendant, but lay at the mercy of another quite different religion, which condescended to accord it toleration. Such was the permanent result. No doubt there was also, in the sack of the city, much damage done to many of the idols by a greedy soldiery, who may have carried off many images of gold or silver, and broken up others that were not portable, and stripped off the plates of precious metal from the idols of "brass, and iron, and wood, and stone" (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a>).

Her chastisements have long been "threshing" Israel, separating the grain from the chaff, and will do so still more as time goes on. The prophet's message is for the comfort of those who shall have gone through the process and become the true "children of the threshing-floor"  - pure wheat, fit to be gathered into the garner of God (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>).

Watchman, what of the night?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - THE BURDEN OF DUMAH. This short "burden" is probably to be understood as uttered with reference to Edom, which the prophet prefers to call "<span class="accented">Dumah</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">silence</span>," in reference to the desolation which he sees to be coming upon the country. Such a play upon words is very usual in the East. Isaiah has already given an instance of it in the name under which he has designated Heliopolis (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Dumah</span>. There were at least two towns of this name ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 459, 460); but neither of them is in the district of Seir. It is best, therefore, to regard "<span class="accented">Dumah"</span> here as representing Edom, or Iaumaea (so the LXX., Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, <span class="accented">Kay</span>, Cheyne, and others). <span class="cmt_word">He calleth to me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">one calleth to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I seem to hear a call from Mount Seir, as of one making inquiry of me. There is no need to suppose that the inquiry was actually made. Mount Self, or the district south-south-east of the Dead Sea, was the heart of the Idumaean country, which thence extended vaguely eastward and westward. <span class="cmt_word">What of the night</span>? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what hour, or, rather, perhaps, what watch of the night is it? May we consider that "<span class="accented">the</span> night is far spent, and the day at hand? Edom had offended Sargon by joining with Ashdod (G.

We may (conjecturally) understand the "morning" of the earlier part of Sennacherib's reign, when Edom was at peace with Assyria, merely paying a moderate tribute (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 132), and the "night" of the later period in the same king's reign, when (about  <span class="date">B.C. 694-690</span>) the country suffered from another Assyrian invasion, in which the king's treasures and his gods were carried off to Nineveh (ibid., p. 137<span class="cmt_word">).

Some take this very literally, as meaning, "<span class="accented">If</span> ye would inquire further into the meaning of this answer, do so; return to me; come again." But this implies that the Edomites had sent an actual messenger to make the inquiry of ver. 5, which is improbable. Others understand a reproach to Edom: "If ye will have recourse to God in the time of trouble, do so; but then do more - return to him altogether; come, and be one with Judah."

The word used is commonly translated "forest;" but Arabia has no forests, and the meaning here must be "brushwood." Thorny bushes and shrubs are common in all parts of Arabia.

"Kedar" is a name of greater note than either Dedan or Tome. It seems to be used here as inclusive of Dedan, perhaps as a designation of the northern Arabians generally. The people of Kedar, like those of Dedan, carried on trade with Tyro (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-21.htm">Ezekiel 27:21</a>). They dwelt partly in tents (<a href="../../par/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>), partly in villages (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-11.htm">Isaiah 42:11</a>), and were rich in flocks and herds and in camels. Though not mentioned in the inscriptions of Sargon, Sennacherib, or Esarhaddon, the contemporaries of Isaiah, they hold a prominent place in those of Esarhaddon's son and successor, Asshurbanipal, with whom they carried on a war of some considerable duration in conjunction with the Nabathaeans (G.

What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - A PROPHECY AGAINST JERUSALEM. The prophet, present in Jerusalem, either actually, or at any rate in spirit, <span class="accented">sees</span> the inhabitants crowded together upon the housetops, in a state of boisterous merriment (vers. 1, 2). Outside the walls is a foreign army threatening the town (vers. 5-7). Preparations have been made for resistance, which are described (vers. 8-11); but there has been no turning to God. On the contrary, the danger has but made the bulk of the people reckless. Instead of humbling themselves and putting on sackcloth, and weeping, and appealing to God's mercy, they have determined to drown care in drink and sensual enjoyment (vers. 12, 13). Therefore the prophet is bidden to denounce woe upon them, and threaten that Jehovah will not forgive their recklessness until their death (ver. 14). There is nothing to mark very distinctly the nationality of the foreign army; but it is certainly represented as made up of contingents from many nations. Delitzsch holds that the Assyrian armies were never so made up, or, at any rate, that the nations here mentioned never served in its ranks ('Site of Paradise,' p. 237); but this is, perhaps, assuming that our knowledge on the subject is more complete and exact than is really the case. It is almost impossible to imagine any other army than the Assyrian besieging Jerusalem in Isaiah's time. Moreover, the particulars concerning the preparations made against the enemy (vers. 9-11) agree with those mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3-5</a> and 30 as made by Hezekiah against Sennacherib. And the second section of the chapter has certainly reference to this period. It seems, therefore, reasonable to regard the siege intended as that conducted by Sennacherib in his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), of which we have a brief account in his annals (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, 11. 15-18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The burden of the valley of vision</span>. "The valley of vision" is only mentioned here and in ver. 5. It must have been one of the deep depressions near Jerusalem troll which there is a good view of the town. The LXX. render, "the burden of the valley of <span class="accented">Zion</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>What aileth thee now</span>? Jerusalem is addressed by the prophet, who assumes the <span class="accented">role</span> of a spectator, surprised at what he <span class="accented">sees</span>, and <span class="accented">asks</span> an explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That thou art wholly gone up to the housetops</span>. Partly, no doubt, they went to watch the enemy and his movements, as Rosenm&uuml;ller says; but still more for feasting and revelry (<a href="../../par/judges/16-27.htm">Judges 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). The flat roofs of Oriental houses are often used as places of recreation and entertainment, especially in  the evening (Shaw, 'Travels,' p. 211; Chardin, 'Voyages en Perse,' vol. 4. p. 116; Layard, 'Nineveh,' vol. 1. p. 177, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-2.htm">Isaiah 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain <i>men are</i> not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A joyous city</span> (comp. ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Thy slain men are not slain with the sword.</span> It is a blockade rather than a siege. Men die, not of wounds, but of privations (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>). Sennacherib himself says, "Hezekiah, like a caged bird, within Jerusalem, his royal city, I confined; towers round about him I raised; and the exit of the great gate of his city I shut" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 15-18).

We must make allowance for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is that numbers of the principal men, regarding resistance as vain, had endeavored to make their escape from the doomed town, but had been captured and bound by the enemies' archers. <span class="cmt_word">All that are found in thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">belonging to thee</span>. The reference is to those who had made their escape and were fleeing far away. The archers seize them, and bind them <span class="accented">all together</span>. We often see a number of captives bound together by a single rope in the Egyptian bas-reliefs. <span class="cmt_word">Which have fled from far</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which were flying far away</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-4.htm">Isaiah 22:4</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore said I.</span> The prophet turns from the description of the scene before him to an account of his own feelings. <span class="cmt_word">Look away from me, he says</span>; "leave me free to vent my sorrow without restraint; I wish for no consolation - only leave me to myself." <span class="cmt_word">Because of the spoiling</span>. The word used sometimes means" destruction;" but" spoiling" is a better rendering here. Sennacherib describes his "spoiling" of Jerusalem on this occasion as follows: "Thirty talents of gold, eight hundred talents of silver, precious carbuncles, great... stones, couches of ivory, lofty thrones of ivory, skins of buffaloes, horns of buffaloes, weapons, everything, a great treasure, and his daughters, the eunuchs of his palace, male musicians, and female musicians, to Nineveh, the city of my dominion, did Hezekiah send after me" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135, II. 29-37). To what straits Hezekiah was reduced in order to collect a sufficient amount of the precious metals we learn from <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15, 16</a>.

God has in reserve such a day; and it will assuredly arrive in due course. Hence the prophet's grief. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of vision</span>. We may suppose that Hezekiah, before he made the submission recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a> and in the 'Cylinder of Sennacherib,' col. 4:11. 28, 29, tried the chances of battle against the Assyrians <span class="accented">in this valley</span>, and that Isaiah had a prophetic vision of the fight. <span class="cmt_word">Breaking down the walls</span>; rather, <span class="accented">undermining</span>. The Assyrian sculptures show numerous examples of this practice. Sometimes swords or spears are used to dislodge the stones of the wall, sometimes crow-bars or axes (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 82). <span class="cmt_word">Crying</span>. Some regard this word, and also that translated "the walls" in the preceding clause, as proper names, and render the passage, "Kir undermineth, and Shoa is at the mount" (Ewald, Cheyne, Luzzatto). But it seems unlikely that "Kit" would be mentioned twice.

Elam, the country extending from the Zagros range to the Lower Tigris, and watered by the Choaspes, Eulaeus, Pasitigris, and other rivers, was an independent kingdom from a very early date (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1, 9</a>), and in Isaiah's time was generally hostile to Assyria. Sargon, however, relates that he conquered a portion of the country, planted colonies in it from the more western parts of his empire, and placed both colonists and natives under the governor of Babylon ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 16). It is thus quite possible that both Sargon and Sennacherib may have had a contingent of Elamites in their armies. <span class="cmt_word">With chariots of men and horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with troops of men</span> (<span class="accented">who were</span>) <span class="accented">horsemen</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a>). Kir uncovered the shield. "Kir" is mentioned in 2 Kings as the place to which Tiglath-Pileser transported the inhabitants of Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>), and by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>) as the original country from which the Syrians were derived. It has been recently identified with Kirkhi, near Diarbekr, or with Kirruri, in the Urumiyah country (Cheyne); but neither identification is marc than possible. (On uncovering shields as a preliminary to engaging in battle, see Caesar, 'Do Bell. Gall.,' 2:21.)

God drew this aside, and they suddenly saw their danger, and began to think how they could best defend themselves. Arms were the first things needed. <span class="cmt_word">The armor of the house of the forest</span>. "The house of the forest" was probably that portion of the palace of Solomon which he had called "the house of the forest of Lebanon"  (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>). This was, it would seem, used as an armor (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a>).

"The city of David" may be here a name for Jerusalem generally, as "the city where David dwelt" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>), or it may designate the eastern hill, where David fixed his residence (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15, 16, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a> we read that Hezekiah at this time "built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Mille in <span class="accented">the city of David</span>," where a particular part of Jerusalem seems certainly to be meant. <span class="cmt_word">Ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.</span> The arrangements made by Hezekiah with respect to the water-supply at the time of Sennacherib's invasion, seem to have been the following: He found on the north of the city, where the Assyrian attack was certain to be delivered, in the vicinity of the Damascus gate, a pool or reservoir (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>), fed by a conduit from some natural source, which lay open and patent to view. The superfluous water ran off from it by a "brook" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-4.htm">2 Chronicles 32:4</a>), which passed down the Tyropoeon valley, and joined the Kedron to the southeast of Ophel. His first step was to cover over and conceal the open reservoir, and also the" brook" which ran from it, at least as far as the northern city wall, to prevent their use by the Assyrians. He then further made a conduit underground (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>) within the city, along the Tyropoeon depression, to a second reservoir, or "pool," also within the city, which could be freely used by the inhabitants (see ver. 11; and comp. Ecclus. 48:17). Further, it is probable that he carried a conduit from this second pool, under the temple area, to the" fount of the Virgin" on the eastern side of Ophel, and thence further conveyed the water by a tunnel through Ophel to the "pool of Siloam." (This last may be the work here alluded to.) The inscription recently discovered at this peel is probably of Hezekiah's time (see 'Quarterly Statement' of Palest. Expl. Fund for April, 1881, p. 70). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/22-10.htm">Isaiah 22:10</a></div><div class="verse">And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have numbered... have broken down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye numbered</span>... <span class="accented">ye broke down</span>. The "numbering" was probably in order to see how many could be spared for pulling down. The repair of the walls with materials thus furnished was a sign of extreme haste and urgency. It would seem from vers. 7, 8 that the repairs were not begun until the town was invested.

It has been said that "baldness" was forbidden by the Law (Cheyne); but this is not so, absolutely. Baldness was wholly forbidden to the priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-20.htm">Ezekiel 44:20</a>); and certain peculiar modes of shaving the hair, the beard, and the eyebrows, practiced by idolatrous nations, were prohibited to all the people (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>). But such shaving of the head as was practiced by Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and other pious men, was not forbidden to laymen, any more than the wearing of sackcloth. It was regarded as a natural mode of exhibiting grief.

"Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die," is a common sentiment, if not a common expression. It has been supposed to have given rise to the Egyptian practice of carrying round the model of a mummy to the guests at feasts. According to the Greeks, Sardanapalus had a phrase very like it engraved upon his tomb ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 500). Sailors have often acted upon it, when they found it impossible to save their ship. On seeing their city invested, a portion of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, despairing of safety, did as sailors have done so frequently.

In its first and simplest application, this section predicts the fall of one state official and the advancement of an-other - matters, no doubt, of some importance in the court history of the time, but scarcely (with reverence be it said) of such moment as to be worthy either of prophetic announcement or of divinely inspired record. It has, therefore, been generally felt that there must be a secondary application of the passage. According to some, the two officials represent respectively the two cove-hunts, the old and the new; according to others, they stand for the two great parties in the Jewish slate of the time - that which put its trust in Jehovah, and that which leant upon heathen alliances. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of hosts</span>. This form, <span class="accented">Adonay Jehovah Tsabaoth - rarely</span> used by Isaiah, but occurring above in vers. 5, 12, and 13 - seems to show that this section is in its right place, being intended as a sequel to the description of Sennacherib's siege. <span class="cmt_word">This treasurer</span>. The word "<span class="accented">this"</span> is contemptuous. That translated "treasurer" is of doubtful import. The key to it is probably to be found in the cognate noun, translated "storehouse" in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>, and "store" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12</a>.

To be justified in hewing out a large tomb, Shebna should have had a numerous family for whom graves would be needed. Otherwise, his excavation of a grand sepulcher was merely selfish and ostentatious. <span class="cmt_word">As he that heweth him out a sepulcher on high.</span> Jewish tombs of any pretension were generally excavations in the solid rock, on the side of some hill or mountain, and had often a very elevated position. Tombs exist on the slopes of all the hills about Jerusalem, but are most numerous on the eastern side of the temple mount, which slopes steeply to the Kedron valley. A square-topped doorway leads into a chamber, generally square, from which recesses, six or seven feet long, two broad, and three high, are carried into the rock horizontally, either on a level with the floor, or with a platform, or shelf, halfway up one of the walls. These recesses have been called <span class="accented">loculi</span>. After a body had been placed in one, it was commonly closed by a stone, which fitted into the end, and thus shut off the body from the chamber. Chambers had sometimes twelve such <span class="accented">loculi</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>An habitation</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>). We must not suppose, however, that the Jews, like the Egyptians and Etruscans, regarded the soul as inhabiting the tomb. The soul descended into <span class="accented">sheol</span>; the grave was the "<span class="accented">habitation"</span> of the body only.

Jehovah scorns to be meant in both clauses (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>). The full accomplishment of this prophecy is nowhere declared to us. We merely find that, by the time of Rabshakeh's arrival at Jerusalem as Sennacherib's envoy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-2.htm">Isaiah 36:2-4</a>), Shebna had lost his post as prefect of the palace, and filled the lower position of scribe or secretary. He may, however, have been subsequently further degraded, and thereupon he may have fled to Egypt, as Jeroboam did (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>).

The dress of office worn by Shebna would be taken from him, and Eliakim would be invested therewith. The "robe" is the long-sleeved cloak or tunic worn commonly by persons of rank; the "girdle" is probably an ornamental one, like those of the priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-39.htm">Exodus 28:39</a>), worn over the inner tunic. <span class="cmt_word">He shall be a father</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a protector, counselor, guide (comp. <a href="../../par/job/29-16.htm">Job 29:16</a>, "I was <span class="accented">a father to the poor</span>: and the cause which I knew not I searched out").

A key would seem to have been the special badge of the prefect's office, which included the control of the stores (ver. 15), and the general management of the household. It was, perhaps, a part of the form of investiture, that the key should be first laid on the prefect's shoulder and then delivered into his hand. Among the Greeks the priests of Ceres are said to have borne a key on their shoulder, permanently, as a badge of office (Callimach., 'Hymn. ad Cererem,' 1. 45). The reference to this passage in <a href="../../par/revelation/3-7.htm">Revelation 3:7</a> is sufficient to show that Eliakim, the "servant of Jehovah" (ver. 20), is, to a certain extent, a type of Christ; perhaps also of his faithful ministers (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>).

This verse has been truly called "an enigma" (Kay). It is impossible to understand it of Shebna. "The nail that was fastened in a sure place" can only refer to the nail said to have been so fastened in ver. 23. Are we, then, to understand that Eliakim too will experience a reverse of fortune? But then all the force of the contrast between him and Shebna would be gone. Is it not possible that the prophet, seeing in Eliakim a type of the Messiah, and becoming more and more Messianic in his utterances, has ended by forgetting the type altogether, and being absorbed in the thought of the antitype? He, the nail, so surely fixed in his eternal place, would nevertheless be "removed" for a time, and then "he cut down and fall" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-14.htm">Isaiah 52:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>).

We here reach the last of the "burdens" - the concluding chapter of the series of denunciatory prophecies which commenced with <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. It is an elegy "in three stanzas, or strophes" (Cheyne) - the first extending from ver. 1 to ver. 5; the second, thence to ver. 9; and the third from ver. 10 to ver. 14. An undertone of sadness, and even of commiseration, prevails throughout it, the prophet viewing Tyre as a fellow-sufferer with Israel, persecuted and oppressed by the fame enemy, Assyria, which was everywhere pushing her conquests, and had recently extended her dominion even over Babylon (ver. 13). This last allusion fixes the date of the prophecy to a time subsequent to  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, when the Assyrian monarch, Sargon, first conquered the country, and took the title of king (G. Smith, 'Epanym Canon,' p. 86). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howl</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>, 31).

"Ships of Tarshish" are first mentioned in connection with the trade carried on by Solomon. Apparently, the term there designates a certain class of ship rather than those engaged in a particular trade (see the comment on 1 Kings 22:48 in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 2. p. 623). Here, however, Phoenician ships, actually engaged in the trade with Tartessus, may be intended. Tartessus was a very ancient Phoenician settlement in the south of Spain, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, and was the center of a most important and lucrative commerce (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>; Herod., i. 163; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12</a>, etc.). In the present passage the returning fleet of merchantmen is addressed, and told that the harbour to which they are hastening is closed, the city desolate. <span class="cmt_word">From the land of Chittim</span>. "Chittim" here, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a>, and elsewhere <span class="accented">generally</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> probably Cyprus, whose most ancient capital was called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Kitten</span> (see Joseph, 'Ant. Jud,' 1:6, &sect; 1). The name "Chittim" is not improbably a variant of "Khittim," "the Hittites," who may have been the first to colonize the island. A fleet from the Western Mediterranean would naturally touch at Cyprus on its way to Tyro, and would there learn the calamity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/23-2.htm">Isaiah 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be still</span>; rather, <span class="accented">be silent</span>, as in the margin.

Tyro was situated on a small isle, which Alexander joined to the mainland by means of a mole (Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 2:23). It is uncertain, however, whether this isle is meant here, or the strip of Phoenician coast, since the Hebrew '<span class="accented">i</span> has both meanings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whom the merchants of Zidon... have replenished</span>. During the flourishing period of Tyro (B.C. 1025-585), Zidon, though it had generally kings of its own, played a secondary part to Tyre, and for the most part acquiesced in Tyrian supremacy. Its best sailors served in the Tyrian fleet (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>), and its merchants were content to enrich the recognized "chief city."

But the fall of Tyre was always a shock to them, and was felt to portend evil to themselves. The Asiatic power which was strong enough to capture the island-fortress would be a formidable enemy to Egypt itself, and might be expected at no distant date to attempt the conquest of the Nile valley.

When Sennacherib attacked Elulaeus of Sidon ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), that monarch fled across the sea ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 35), probably to Cyprus. When Alexander finally ruined Tyre, a part of the population made its escape on shipboard to Carthage (Arrian,' Exp. Alex.,' 2:24, &sect; 8). An escape of the kind is represented in the Assyrian sculptures (Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' first series, pl. 7l).

It must be noted, however, on the other hand, that there is no mention at all of <span class="accented">Tyro</span> in Homer, and none in Scripture until the time of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>), about  <span class="date">B.C. 1300</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn</span> (so Lowth, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Ewald, Kay).

Chittim (Cyprus) was a nearer refuge than Tarshish, and far more easily reached; but, on the other hand, it was much less safe. Sargon and Esarhaddon both of them exercised dominion over it; and when Abdi-Milkut, King of Sidon, fled there in the reign of the latter, the Assyrian monarch pursued him, caught him, and "cut off his head" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 137). Still, it was so often sought by princes flying from Phoenicia when attacked by Assyria, that cuneiform scholars call it "the usual refuge of the Phoenician kings" ('Transactions of Bibl.

There is no "till" in the original. The clause is separate and independent, not connected grammatically with the preceding.

The allusion is probably to certain severities of Sargon's in  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>, which, however, are rhetorically exaggerated.

St. Jerome thought that this prophecy had not been accomplished in his day. If so, it cannot be said to have been accomplished yet; unless, indeed, Tyre may be regarded as representing the commercial spirit, which. under Christianity, is not necessarily alien from religion, but shows itself sometimes altogether friendly to the Church, supplying ways and means for ten thousand  philanthropic and praiseworthy enterprises (ver. 18). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tyro shall be forgotten</span>; i.e. "shall cease to occupy men's thoughts, as a factor in politics - shall pass out of their calculations, and count for nothing." <span class="cmt_word">Seventy years</span>. "Forty years" and "seventy years" are the chief representatives in Scripture of an indefinite time. The week of creation seems to have given to seven its quasi-sacred character, which passed from the primary number to the corresponding decimal one. The sacred use of "seventy" appears first in the "seventy elders" who accompanied Moses to the covenant-feast on Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>). After this, "seventy 'talents are mentioned as the weight of the bronze offerings for the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-29.htm">Exodus 38:29</a>), and "seventy" shekels as the weight of the silver bowls offered by the heads of tribes when the tabernacle was set up (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-13.htm">Numbers 7:13-85</a>). The "indefinite" us, of "seventy" is most apparent in such expressions as that of <a href="../../par/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>, "If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, surely Lamech <span class="accented">seventy</span> and sevenfold;" and that of <a href="../../par/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>, "I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until <span class="accented">seventy</span> times seven."

From special denunciations of woe upon particular nations - Baby-loll, Assyria, Philistia, Moab, Syria of Damascus, Egypt and Ethiopia, Arabia, Judea, Tyre - the prophet passes to denunciations of a broader character, involving the future of the whole world. This section of his work extends from the commencement of <a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>. to the conclusion of <a href="../../par/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, thus including four chapters. The world at large is the general subject of the entire prophecy; but the "peculiar people" still maintains a marked and prominent place, as spiritually the leading country, and as one in whose fortunes the world at large would be always vitally concerned (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6, 9, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty</span>. Several critics (Lowth, Ewald, Gesenius, Knobel) prefer to render, "maketh the <span class="accented">land</span> empty;" but the broader view, which is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kay, Cheyne, and others, seems preferable. The mention of "the world" in ver. 4, and of "the-kings of the earth" in ver. 21, implies a wider field of survey than the Holy Land. Of course the expression, "maketh empty," is rhetorical, some remarkable, but not complete, depopulation being pointed at (comp. ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Turneth it upside down</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-27.htm">Ezekiel 21:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Scattereth abroad the inhabitants</span>.

All shall suffer equally. The author is obliged to take as examples distinctions of rank known to him; but he carefully selects such as are of almost universal occurrence. There was scarcely any nation of antiquity in which there were not "priests and people," "masters and slaves," "buyers and sellers," "lenders and borrowers," "takers and givers of usury." By "usury" is meant, not exorbitant interest, but interest simply, of whatever amount.

For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.., all these are the beginning of sorrows" (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6-8</a>).

All the great are brought down, and laid low, that "the Lord alone may be exalted in that day" (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a></div><div class="verse">The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth also is defiled</span>. Hitherto the prophet has been concerned with the mere fact of a terrible judgment to be sent by God upon the whole world. Now he sets forth the cause of the fact. It is the old cause, which has reduced so many lauds to desolation, and which in the far-off times produced the Flood, viz. the wickedness of man (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5-13</a>). The earth is "defiled" or "polluted" by the sins of its inhabitants, and has to be purged from the defilement by suffering. <span class="cmt_word">They have transgressed the laws</span>. Apart from both Judaism and Christianity, all mankind have been placed by God under a double law: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The "law written in their hearts" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>), which speaks to them through their consciences, and lays them under an obligation that cannot be gainsaid. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The law of positive commands, given to the entire human race through the common progenitors, Adam and Noah, which is obligatory upon all to whom it has been traditionally handed down; but which has been only very partially handed down, and it is not generally felt as obligatory. Mankind has in all ages largely transgressed both laws, and both would seem to be pointed at in the present passage. The transgression of the "law written in the heart" is doubtless that which especially calls down God's vengeance, and makes him from time to time execute wrath on the whole world. Changed the ordinance; rather, <span class="accented">broken</span>, <span class="accented">violated</span>. Transgression in act is intended, not formal abrogation of the Divine ordinances. Broken the everlasting covenant. Mr. Cheyne supposes an allusion to the covenant made with Noah (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-16.htm">Genesis 9:16</a>); but it seems better to understand that "everlasting covenant" which exists between God and man, in virtue of the nature wherewith God has endowed man, and of the laws which he Ires impressed upon man's con. science.

Even when the joyous time of the vintage comes round, the earth is still sad, cannot shake off its depression or wake up to merriment.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/24-9.htm">Isaiah 24:9</a></div><div class="verse">They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall not drink wine with a song</span>. Men will still drink; they will seek to drown their care in wine; but they will not have the heart to attempt a song as they drink. Even in their cups they will be silent. <span class="cmt_word">Strong drink shall be bitter</span>. By "strong drink" (<span class="accented">shekar</span>) seems to be meant any intoxicating liquor whatever, including wine. Many such liquors were drunk in Palestine (see 'Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 458, 459). All were more or less pleasant to the taste; but they would taste bitter to those who were warped and soured by the calamities of the time, which would prevent all enjoyment.

Wine, though still manufactured (see vers. 7, 9) is scarce, but is much sought after. Men clamor for it at the doors of the wine-shops, but are unable to obtain it. They crave for its exhilarating effects, or perhaps for the oblivion which it brings when drunk to excess. If they could obtain it, they would act as the Jews in the siege of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>). But they cannot. Hence even the factitious merriment, which wine is capable of producing, is denied now to the inhabitants of the earth, with whom <span class="cmt_word">all joy is darkened</span>, from whom <span class="cmt_word">all mirth is gone</span>.

The thought of this joyful time, when the saints shall reign with their Lord in a new heaven and a new earth, recalls the prophet (contrast being one of the laws of the association of ideas) to the misery of the present, and his own participation therein. A time of suffering, of wasting, and pining away must be endured - for how long he knows not - before the joyous consummation, towards which he stretches in hope and confident expectancy, can be reached.

Upon the destruction of the world there is to supervene a visitation of those who have been specially instrumental in producing the great wickedness that has brought the world to an end. These most guilty ones are classified under two heads: they consist of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the host of the high ones that are on high (literally, "the host of the height in the height"); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the kings of the earth upon the earth. These are to be "gathered together in the pit," and "shut up in the prison," and finally, after a long imprisonment, punished (vers. 21, 22). Then the visible reign of the Lord of hosts is to be established "in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem," and he is to rule in the presence of his "ancients" in glory (ver. 23). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. About that time - in connection with the series of events just related. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord shall punish the host of the high ones</span>. It is generally allowed that these high ones, set m contrast as they are with the "kings of the earth," must belong to the class of supramundane intelligences, spiritual beings of a high order. Some have inclined to identify them with the "patron-spirits of nations," spoken of by Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-13.htm">Daniel 10:13, 20, 21</a>); but those "patron-spirits" are among the elect and unfallen angels; they protect nations, but do not lead them into sin or wickedness; they have no need to be "visited," and will certainly not be "shut up in prison" with the wicked kings of the earth. The spirits here spoken of must belong to the class of fallen spirits  - they must be included among those "principalities and powers," of whom St. Paul speaks (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>), whom he calls "the rulers of the darkness of this world," and to whom he ascribes "spiritual wickedness in high places." The punishment of such spirits is, perhaps, shadowed forth in the eighty-second psalm; it was distinctly taught in the Book of Enoch; and it is glanced at by St. Jude in his Epistle (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And the kings</span>. Kings, especially kings in the Oriental sense, have an enormous influence over the nations which they govern, and therefore a heavy responsibility. The kings of the nations are viewed here as having brought about the general corruption and wickedness which has necessitated the destruction of the earth.

AS in <a href="../../par/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>, after describing the first setting up of Christ's kingdom and the call of the Gentiles, the prophet broke out into song, through joy at the tidings he was commissioned to announce, so now, having proclaimed the final establishment of the same kingdom in the heavenly Zion, he is again carried away by the sense of exultant gladness into a fresh <span class="accented">Lobgesang</span>, which he utters in his own person - not, as the former one, in the person of the Church. His song divides itself into three sections: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> vers. 1-5, a thanksgiving for deliverance; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> vers. 6-8, a commemoration of blessings granted; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> vers. 9-12, exultation in the security obtained. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my God; I will exalt thee</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/118-28.htm">Psalm 118:28</a>). To Isaiah the "Song of Moses" seems to have been a pattern thanksgiving, from which he delighted to draw his phrases when he was bent on formally singing praise to God. Compare the following: <a href="../../par/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/12-2.htm">Isaiah 12:2</a>, "He is become my salvation;" the same with <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "He is my God; I will exalt him;" <a href="../../par/exodus/15-6.htm">Exodus 15:6</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-16.htm">Isaiah 13:16</a>, "Hath dashed in pieces;" <a href="../../par/exodus/15-7.htm">Exodus 15:7</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>, "Consumed them as stubble;" <a href="../../par/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-5.htm">Isaiah 46:5</a>,  "Who is like," etc.? the same with <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>, "Doing wonders;" <a href="../../par/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>, "Fear and dread;" <a href="../../par/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>, "The Lord shall reign." <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful things</span>; <span class="cmt_word">thy counsels of old are</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast wrought wonders</span>, <span class="accented">counsels of old</span>, <span class="accented">faithfulness and truth</span>.

No writer accumulates striking images with such force and beauty as Isaiah. Primarily, the entire imagery has reference to what God will have done for his people when the final consummation arrives. Secondarily, a precious encouragement is held out to all who are undergoing their earthly trial and probation, who are taught where to look for a sure refuge in time of trouble.

There is no restriction of salvation to any particular race or nation - "Jew, Greek, barbarian, Scythian, bond, free" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>), are equally invited, and some of each come in (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/8-11.htm">Matthew 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). The Church of the redeemed contains men and women of all "nations and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues." <span class="cmt_word">A feast of fat things</span>. It follows from many passages of Holy Scripture that there is something in the final beatitude of man which is best represented to us in our present condition by the image of a "feast"  - something very different, no doubt, from the festive joy of which our Teutonic ancestors hoped to partake in the halls of Odin, but yet figured to us most fitly and appropriately by terms ordinarily used to describe earthly feasting. Our Lord tells of a "marriage supper," to which he will invite his friends (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2-12</a>); and the scene of the "marriage supper of the Lamb, "according to St. John in the Revelation" (Revelation 19:7-9), is heaven. There man, it would seem, will partake of a sacrificial feast with his glorified Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-29.htm">Matthew 26:29</a>) - will eat the "heavenly manna," which is "angels' food" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>), and drink a spiritual drink which may be called "the fruit of the vine," deriving from this "eating" and "drinking" life and joy and strength. It has been already observed, in the Commentary upon Exodus (p. 581), that the sacrificial meal on Sinai, whereto the seventy elders were admitted (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-11</a>), prefigured this heavenly feasting, and throws a certain light upon it. All gross and carnal ideas must, of course, be subtracted from the conception of the heavenly festivity; but it seems to be true to say that our author, and also St. John and our Lord himself, imply that in the world to come there will be a feast, at which God will be the Host, and all men, priests and laity alike, his guests, and receive from him the choicest and most exquisite gifts - gifts which will make them supremely happy (see Mr. Cheyne's note on the passage, p. 148). <span class="cmt_word">A feast of wines on the lees</span>. 'Wine which remained on its Ices, and was not poured off them into another vessel, was considered to be of especial strength (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Jeremiah 48:11</a>). Its defect was a want of clearness. The wine of the heavenly banquet is to be at once strong and perfectly clear or "well refined." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will destroy... the face of the covering</span>. According to some, the "covering cast ever all people" is death, and the second clause of the verse is a mere repetition of the first. But, though the heads of criminals were covered when they were led to execution (<a href="../../par/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>), yet death itself is never elsewhere called a "covering." May not the prophet have in view that "veil" or "covering" of misconception and prejudice, whereof St. Paul speaks as lying "on the hearts of the Jewish nation," and preventing them from discerning the true sense of Scripture (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15</a>)? Certainly one of the great curses of humanity while here is its inability to see things as they really are - its colored, distorted, prejudiced, views of life and death, of this world and the next, of self-interest, duty, happiness. This "veil" is certainly to be done away; for "now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face; now we know in part, but then shall we know even as we are known" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>).

Hosea, a contemporary, was inspired to write! "Will ransom Israel from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction" (Hosea 13:14); but otherwise this was the first announcement that death was to disappear and to cease to be a possibility. It was an enormous advance on the dim and vague conceptions of a future life hitherto current (<a href="../../par/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>) to have such an announcement made as this. Hitherto men had been "through fear of death all their life subject to bondage" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>). Now they were taught that, in the resurrection-life, there would be no tear, no possibility of death. The joyous outburst of the apostle, when he quotes the present passage (2 Corinthians 15:54), is the natural thanksgiving song of reassured humanity, on recognizing its final deliverance from the unspeakable terror of death and annihilation. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God will wipe away tears from all faces.</span> A recent commentator asks, "What place is left for tears?" But surely death is not the only cause of human mourning. Our own sins, the sins and sufferings of our dear ones, are the main provocatives of our tears. When it is promised, as here and in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a> and Revelation 21:4, that "there shall be no more pain, neither sorrow nor crying," the revelation is made that <span class="accented">there shall be no more</span> sin; for where sin is, sorrow must be. <span class="cmt_word">The rebuke of his people shall he take away</span>. It will be among the lesser satisfactions of the final condition of the saved that they are no longer subject to reproach. In this life they have to endure continually reproach, rebuke, contumely (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-10.htm">Psalm 74:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-50.htm">Psalm 89:50, 51</a>, etc.). In the resurrection-life they will be exempt from any such annoyance. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken it</span>. God's word has gone forth. There can be no retractation. The blessings promised are certain to be obtained.

The protecting hand of God will ever be stretched out over the spiritual Zion - the Church of the Redeemed  - to defend it and keep it safe throughout eternity. <span class="cmt_word">Moab shall be trodden down</span>. Various reasons have been given for the selection of Moab to represent the enemies of the redeemed. Perhaps, as the Moabites were, on the whole, the bitterest of all the adversaries of the Jews (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>), they are regarded as the fittest representatives of the human adversaries of God. <span class="cmt_word">For the dung-hill</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the water of a dung-pit</span>. The image is, perhaps, selected with conscious reference to <a href="../../par/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, where the psalmist prays that the "children of Lot" and their helpers may become "as the dung of the earth" (ver. 10). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/25-11.htm">Isaiah 25:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth <i>his hands</i> to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall spread forth his hands... as he that swimmeth</span>.

A continued plotting of the enemies of God against his Church seems to be assumed, even after the Church is established in the spiritual Zion under the direct protection and rule of Jehovah.

The prophet, having (in <a href="../../par/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25</a>.) poured forth his own thankfulness to God for the promise of the Church's final redemption and triumph, proceeds now to represent the Church itself in the glorified state as singing praise to God for the same. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day</span>. In the "day of God" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>), the period of the "restitution of all things" (<a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the land of Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the "new earth" - whose city will be the "heavenly Jerusalem," and wherein will dwell "the Israel of God" - the antitype whereof the literal "land of Judah" was the type. <span class="cmt_word">A strong city</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a city of strength</span>. In the Revelation of St. John the new Jerusalem is represented as having "a wall great and high" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>), and "twelve gates," three on each side. The intention is to convey the idea of complete security. In the present passage the city has "gates" (ver. 2), but no "walls" - <span class="cmt_word">walls and bulwarks</span> being unnecessary, since the saving might of God himself would be its sure defense against every enemy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a></div><div class="verse">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Open ye the gates</span>.

A people, made up of all kindreds and nations and tongues, which should henceforth be "the people of God" They are "righteous," as washed clean from all taint of sin in the blood of the Lamb. They "keep the truth," or "keep faithfulness," as under all circumstances clinging loyally to God.

The writer's mind throughout the first paragraph of his" song" (vers. 1-4)"is running" (as Mr. Cheyne well observes) "on the security and immovableness of the new Jerusalem." All is peace and sure defense on God's side; all is trust and perfect confidence on the side of man. The first words of the verse may be taken in various ways - the above rendering (which seems to us the best) is that of Delitzsch and Kay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a></div><div class="verse">Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> everlasting strength:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trust ye in the Lord</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-5.htm">Isaiah 26:5</a></div><div class="verse">For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, <i>even</i> to the ground; he bringeth it <i>even</i> to the dust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He bringeth down</span>; rather, he <span class="accented">hath brought down</span>.

The "world-city" (as it has been called); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the idealized stronghold of the adversaries of God in this world, is intended.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-7.htm">Isaiah 26:7</a></div><div class="verse">The way of the just <i>is</i> uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the just is uprightness</span>; or, <span class="accented">the path for the just is straight</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is one of the main blessings of the righteous that God "makes their way straight before their face" (<a href="../../par/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>), "leads them in a plain path" (<a href="../../par/psalms/27-11.htm">Psalm 27:11</a>), "shows them the way they are to walk in" (<a href="../../par/psalms/143-8.htm">Psalm 143:8</a>), so that they are for the most part free from doubt and perplexity as to the line of conduct which it behooves them to, pursue. If this is so in the present life, still more will it be the uniform condition of the just in another sphere. Then God will of a surety "direct <span class="accented">all</span> their paths" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou, most upright, dost weigh</span>; literally, O <span class="accented">upright One</span>, <span class="accented">thou dost weigh</span>. The term "upright" is applied to God in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/25-8.htm">Psalm 25:8</a>; and <a href="../../par/psalms/92.htm">Psalm 92</a>:16. By "weighing the path of the just" is meant keeping it, as Justice keeps her scales, straight and level.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a></div><div class="verse">Let favour be shewed to the wicked, <i>yet</i> will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let favor be showed to the wicked.</span> This is a further explanation of the reason why the righteous had so earnestly desired the coming of God's judgments upon the earth. They had felt that further mercy and long-suffering wine thrown away upon the wicked, and "only did them harm" (Kay). When "favor was showed them," they did but persist in unrighteousness. <span class="cmt_word">In the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly.</span> Even good example does not convert the wicked man. Though he live in a "land of righteousness," where God and his Law are acknowledged, where true religion is professed, where the gospel is preached, he will continue wicked, he will "deal unjustly;" <span class="cmt_word">he will not behold</span> - or, <span class="accented">consider - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the majesty of the Lord</span>.

The saved had not always been faithful to Jehovah. Some, no doubt, had actually been idolaters, as many of the early Christians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>, etc.). Others had given their hearts for a time to other vanities, and turned away from God. Now, in the new Jerusalem, they confess their short comings, and acknowledge that only through God's mercy - by thee - are they in the condition to celebrate his Name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14</a></div><div class="verse"><i>They are</i> dead, they shall not live; <i>they are</i> deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are dead</span>, etc.; literally. <span class="accented">Dead</span>, <span class="accented">they shall not live</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> return to life); <span class="accented">deceased</span>, <span class="accented">they shall not arise</span>. The power of the idol-gods is altogether passed away. It was for this end - <span class="cmt_word">therefore</span> - that God had <span class="cmt_word">visited and destroyed them, and made their very memory to perish</span>. How strange it seems that the "great gods" whom so many millions worshipped in former times - Bel, and Asshur, and Ammon, and Zeus, and Jupiter - should have passed so completely away as to be almost wholly forgotten! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/26-15.htm">Isaiah 26:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed <i>it</i> far <i>unto</i> all the ends of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast increased the nation</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "righteous nation" of ver. 2 - not the Jewish people merely, but "the Israel of God" - who are to be "a great multitude, that no man can number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues" (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hadst removed it.</span> This rendering gives a very good sense. It makes the redeemed pass in thought from their present state of happiness and glory to that former time of tribulation and affliction when they were a remnant, scattered over the face of the earth (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13-15</a>), driven into its uttermost corners (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>), oppressed and down-trodden by their enemies. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew will bear the rendering. Most modern commentators translate, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> hast extended far all the borders of the land," which is certainly the more natural meaning of the words. If we accept this view, we must regard the clause as continuing the idea contained in the former part of the verse - the nation is increased in number, and its borders are advanced - it is "a multitude that no man can <span class="accented">number</span>," and it has no narrower limits than the "<span class="accented">new</span> earth," which has been given to it for its habitation (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).

Having concluded his "<span class="accented">song</span> of the just" in a minor key with a confession of human weakness, the prophet proceeds to cheer and encourage his disciples by a clear and positive declaration of the doctrine of the resurrection: "Thy dead, O Israel, shall live." He then adds a recommendation for the present - a recommendation to privacy and retirement, until the judgments of God which he has predicted (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>.) are shown forth upon the earth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy dead men shall live</span>. A universal resurrection of" some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt" (<a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>), is not yet announced; but only a resurrection of the just, perhaps only of the just Israelites. The object is encouragement, especially encouragement of those whom the prophet directly addresses - the religious Israelites of his own day. It is enough for them at the present time to know that, whether the day of the Lord comes in their time or no, when it <span class="accented">comes</span>, they will have a part in it. The assurance is given, and is made doubly sure by repetition. The prophet does not say, Together with <span class="cmt_word">my dead body</span> they will arise; for there is nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to "together," and the ellipse of '<span class="accented">ira</span>, "<span class="accented">with</span>," though suggested by Kimchi, is impossible; nor is it likely that he intends to speak of his own dead body at all. He may, perhaps, call the past generations of just Israelites "my dead," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dead with whom he is in sympathy; or the supposed personal suffix may be merely paragogic, as Rosenm&uuml;ller argues. In any case the two clauses must be regarded as identical in meaning - an instance of "synonymous parallelism....

The crowning judgment of all is now briefly described. "In that day" - the day of God's vengeance - when all his other enemies have been put down, Jehovah shall finally visit with his sword three mighty foes, which are described under three figures - the first as "Leviathan, the swift serpent;" the second as "Leviathan, the crooked serpent; "and the third as "the dragon that is in the sea." It has been usual to see in these three monsters three kingdoms inimical to God - either Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt; or Assyria, Egypt, and Tyre; or Media, Persia, and Egypt. But this diversity of interpretation shows that there is no particular fitness in the emblems to symbolize any special kingdoms or world-powers, while the imagery itself and the law of climax alike point to something higher than world-powers being intended. "Leviathan," in <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>, where the word first occurs, represents a supra-mundane power - probably "the dragon, the enemy of light, who in old Eastern traditions is conceived as ready to swallow up sun and moon, and plunge creation in original chaos or darkness" ('Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 4. p. 28); and the "dragon" is a customary emblem of Satan himself (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-13.htm">Psalm 91:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7, 9</a>), the prince of darkness. The triple vengeance here is parallel to the triple punishment, in the apocalyptic vision (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-20.htm">Revelation 19:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>), of "the devil," "the beast," and "the false prophet," who have been termed by commentators "the three great enemies of God's kingdom" (see 'Speaker's Commentary on the New Testament,' vol. 4. p. 802). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord with his sore and great and strong sword</span>. The "sword" of Jehovah is first heard of in the Pentateuch, where it is called" glittering" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>). It is spoken of by David (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-12.htm">Psalm 7:12</a>), and frequently by Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; 46:16). Mr. Cheyne supposes the idea to have been taken from the Baby-Ionian mythology, and seems to think it half material. But it is merely on a par with other anthrepomorphisms. The word rendered "sore" probably means "well-tempered," "keen." <span class="cmt_word">Leviathan</span>. Etymologically, the term "Leviathan" appears to mean "that which is coiled" or "twisted," whence it would seem to have been primarily applied, as in the present verse, to serpents. In <a href="../../par/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1-34</a>, however, it manifestly designates the crocodile, while in <a href="../../par/psalms/104-26.htm">Psalm 104:26</a> it must be used of some kind of cetacean. Thus its most appropriate English rendering would be "monster." <span class="cmt_word">The piercing serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the fleet</span>, or <span class="accented">fugitive serpent</span>. It is a general characteristic of the snake tribe to glide away and hide themselves when disturbed. <span class="cmt_word">Even leviathan that crooked serpent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and also leviathan that crooked serpent</span>. It is quite clear that two distinct foes of God are pointed at - one characterized as "fleet," the other as "tortuous." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall slay the dragon.</span> Here is mention of a third enemy, probably Satan himself (see the introductory paragraph to this section). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2</a></div><div class="verse">In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - GOD'S CARE FOR HIS VINEYARD. This piece may be called a companion picture to <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>, or a joy-song to be set over against that dirge. In both the figure of the vineyard is employed to express the people of God, and God is "the Lord of the vineyard." But whereas, on the former occasion, all was wrath and fury, menace and judgment, here all is mercy and loving-kindness, protection and promise. The difference is, no doubt, not with God, "with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>), but with the vineyard, which is either not the same, or, if the same, then differently circumstanced. The vineyard of <a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>. is beyond all doubt the Jewish Church in the time of Isaiah, or in the times shortly after. The vineyard of the present place is either the Christian Church, or the Jewish Church reformed and purified by suffering. It is not the Church triumphant in heaven, since  there are still "briars and thorns" in it, and there are still those belonging to it who have to "make their peace with God." The prophet has come back from his investigations of the remote future and the supra-mundane sphere to something which belongs to earth, and perhaps not to a very distant period. His second "song of the vineyard" may well comfort the Church through all her earthly struggles. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing ye unto her</span>. Our translators have, strangely enough, inverted the order of the two clauses, which stand thus in the Hebrew: "A vineyard of red wine; sing ye unto it, "or "sing ye of it." The "vineyard of red wine" is one that produces abundance of rich fruit.

Vineyards were considered to require special watching, since they were liable to damage both from thieves and foxes (<a href="../../par/songs/2-15.htm">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>). It was usual to build towers in them, from which a watch could be kept (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will water it every moment</span> (compare the threat in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>, "I will command my clouds that they rain no rain upon it").

God asks, "Who will set the briars and thorns in array against me?" in a tone of contempt. "Who will dare to do battle against me with such weak material?" And then he adds a forecast of the result in such a case: "I would move forward; I would burn them all together" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>).

There is another alternative. If the "thorns and the briars" are not prepared to contend in battle against God, let them adopt a different course. Let them "lay hold of God's strength," place themselves under his protection, and make their appeal to him, and see if they cannot "make their peace with him." A truly evangelical invitation! The enemies of God are entreated to cease from striving against him, and are taught that the door of repentance is still open to them. God is willing to be reconciled even to his enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Let them make peace with him, make peace with him</span>. The reiteration constitutes an appeal of extreme earnestness and tenderness, which none could reject but the utterly impenitent.

A coming judgment upon Judah has been one of the main subjects of Isaiah's prophecy from the beginning.

Hence he may at any time recur to it, as he does now, without special reason or excuse. In this place the special aspect under which the judgment presents itself to him is that of its merciful character, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in degree (vers. 7, 8); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in intention (ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While noting this, he feels, however, bound to note also, that the judgment is, while it lasts, severe (vers. 10, 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath he smitten him</span>; etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Has God smitten Judah, as he '(God) smote Judah's smiters?"

God was about to "put Judah away" - to banish her into a far country; but still he would refrain himself  - he would "not suffer his whole displeasure to arise," or give her over wholly to  destruction. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the east wind</span>, or of the national catastrophe, when his breath was fierce and hard against his people, he would "sigh" at the needful chastisement. As Dr. Kay well says, "Amid the rough and stern severity which he breathed into the tempest, there was an undertone of sadness and grief."

Samaria may be viewed as such a "bough," if the "tree" be taken as "the Israel of God" in the wider sense.

The prophet has now east his eagle glance over the whole world and over all time. He has denounced woe upon all the principal nations of the earth (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13-23</a>.), glanced at the destruction of the world itself (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-17.htm">Isaiah 24:17-20</a>), and sung songs over the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and the ingathering of the nations into it (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25.htm">Isaiah 25-27</a>.). In the present chapter he returns to the condition of things in his own time and among his own people. After a brief warning, addressed to Samaria, he turns to consider the condition of Judah, which he accuses of following the example of Samaria, of perishing through self-indulgence and lack of knowledge (vers. 7-12). He then proceeds to expostulate seriously with the "rulers of Jerusalem," on whom lies the chief responsibility for its future. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the drunkards</span>, The "drunkards of Ephraim," or of the ten tribes, were at once intoxicated with wine (<a href="../../par/amos/4-1.htm">Amos 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) and with pride (<a href="../../par/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). As the external aspect of affairs grew mere and more threatening through the advances of Tiglath-Pileser and Shalmaneser, they gave themselves up more and more to self-indulgence and luxury, lay upon beds of ivory, drank wine from bowls, feasted to the sound of the viol, and even invented fresh instruments of music (<a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4, 5</a>). At the same time, they said in their hearts, "Have we not taken by our own strength?" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). They persisted in regarding themselves as secure, when even ordinary political foresight might have seen that their end was approaching. <span class="cmt_word">Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty</span>. The "glorious beauty" of Samaria was a beauty of magnificent luxury. "Summer" and "winter houses," distinct each from the other (<a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); "ivory palaces" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>); a wealth of "gardens, vineyards, fig-orchards, and olive yards" (<a href="../../par/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>); residences of "hewn stone" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>); feasts enlivened with "the melody of viols" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>); "beds of ivory" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>); "wine in bowls" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); "chief ointments" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>); constituted a total of luxurious refinement beyond which few had proceeded at the time, and which Isaiah was fain to recognize, in a worldly point of view, as "glorious" and "beautiful." But the beauty was of a kind liable to fade, and it was already fading under the sirocco of Assyrian invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Which are on the head of the fat valleys</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which is on the head</span> (or, <span class="accented">which decks the head</span>) <span class="accented">of the rich valley</span>. Samaria was built on a hill of an oval form, which rose up in the midst of a fertile valley shut in by mountains. The prophet identifies the valley with the kingdom itself, and then personifies it, and regards its head as crowned by the fading flower of Samaria's beauty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, <i>which</i> as a tempest of hail <i>and</i> a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath a mighty and strong one</span>.

In the present ease the "mighty and strong one" is the Assyrian power. <span class="cmt_word">As a tempest of hail,</span> etc. The fearfully devastating force of an Assyrian invasion is set forth under three distinct images - a hailstorm, a furious tempest of wind, and a violent inundation - as though so only could its full horror be depicted. War is always a horrible scourge; but in ancient times, and with a people so cruel as the Assyrians, it was a calamity exceeding in terribleness the utmost that the modern reader can conceive. It involved the wholesale burning of cities and villages, the wanton destruction of trees and crops, the slaughter of thousands in battles and sieges, the subsequent massacre of hundreds in cold blood, the plunder of all classes, and the deportation of tens of thousands of captives, who were carried into hopeless servitude in a strange land. <span class="cmt_word">With the hand</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with force," "violently."

The "beauty" of Samaria would tempt the Assyrians to desire it so soon as they saw it, and would rouse an appetite which would be content with nothing less than the speedy absorption of the coveted morsel. Samaria's siege, once begun, was pressed without intermission, and lasted less than three years (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>) - a short space compared to that of other sieges belonging to about the same period; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of Ashdod, besieged twenty-nine years (Herod., 2. 157); that of Tyre, besieged thirteen years ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3:492).

Her sister's fate was the most powerful of all possible warnings to Judah against treading in her steps. Samaria had perished through want of faith in Jehovah. She had turned to other gods; she had trusted in her own "glory" and "beauty;" and she had trusted in Egypt. If Judah would do the exact opposite, she might be saved. If she would take Jehovah for her "Crown of glory" and "Diadem of beauty," he was willing to be so taken. He was willing to impart a "spirit of judgment" to her rulers, and "strength" to her armed force. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day shall the Lord of hosts be</span>, etc. This is an offer, and something more than an offer. It is implied that, to some extent, the offer would be accepted. And clearly the closing of the clouds around Samaria was coincident with the dawn of a brighter day in Judah. Hezekiah came to the throne only three years before the fatal siege of Samaria began. His accession must have been nearly contemporaneous with that expedition of Shal-maneser against Hoshea, when he "shut him up, and bound him in prison" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>). Yet he was not daunted by his neighbor's peril. He began his reign with a political revolution and a religious reformation. He threw off the yoke of Assyria, to which his father had submitted (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>), and he cleared the land of idols and idol-worship. It was the dawn of a day of promise, such as the prophet seems to point to in these two verses. Unhappily, the dawn was soon clouded over (vers. 7-9). <span class="cmt_word">The residue of his people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Judah.

But the numerous passages which tax both the Israelites and the Jews of the period with drunkenness (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>, etc.), are best understood literally. Orientals (e.g, the Persians) are often given to such indulgence. <span class="cmt_word">Have erred through wine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">reel with wine</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Are out of the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">stagger</span>. The verbs express the physical effects of intoxication. <span class="cmt_word">The priest and the prophet</span>. Priests were forbidden by the Law to drink any wine or strong drink previously to their taking part in the service of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a>), and the prohibition was always understood to apply <span class="accented">afortiori to</span> the temple (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-21.htm">Ezekiel 44:21</a>). Prophets might have been expected to act in the spirit of the command given to priests. By "prophets" here Isaiah means, not persons especially called of God, but official members of the prophetical order. Of these there were always many in Judah, who had no strong sense of religion (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2-16</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-12.htm">Amos 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-4.htm">Zephaniah 3:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">They err in vision</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they reel in the vision</span>. They are drunken, even in the very exercise of their prophetical office - when they see, and expound, their visions. <span class="cmt_word">They stumble in judgment</span>; or, <span class="accented">they stagger when pronouncing judgment</span> (Delitzsch). Persons in authority had been specially warned not to drink wine before the hearing of causes (<a href="../../par/proverbs/31-4.htm">Proverbs 31:4, 5</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a></div><div class="verse">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? <i>them that are</i> weaned from the milk, <i>and</i> drawn from the breasts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom shall he teach</span>? A sudden and abrupt transition. The best explanation seems to be that suggested by Jerome, and followed by Bishop Lowth and most commentators, viz. that the prophet dramatically introduces his adversaries as replying to him with taunting speeches. "Whom does he think he is teaching?" they ask. "Mere children, just weaned from their mother's milk, and taken away from the breast? Does he forget that we are grown men - nay, priests and prophets? And what poor teaching it is! What 'endless petty feazing'! (Delitzsch) - precept upon precept," etc. The intention is to throw ridicule upon the smallness and vexatious character of the prophet's interminable and uninterrupted chidings (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge... doctrine</span>. Technical terms in Isaiah's teaching, which his adversaries seem to have ridiculed as "catch-words." The term translated "doctrine" means properly "tidings," and involves the idea that the prophet obtained the teaching so designated by direct revelation from God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/28-10.htm">Isaiah 28:10</a></div><div class="verse">For precept <i>must be</i> upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, <i>and</i> there a little:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For precept must be upon precept</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for it is precept upon precept</span> (Lowth, Cheyne). The whole teaching is nothing but an accumulation of precept upon precept, rule upon rule, one little injunction followed up by another, here a  little, there a little. The objectors profess to find in the prophet's teaching nothing grand, nothing broad - no enunciation of great leading principles; but a perpetual drizzling rain of petty maxims and rules, vexatious, cramping, confining; especially unsuitable to men Who had had the training of priests and prophets, and could have appreciated a grand theory, or a new religious standpoint, but were simply revolted at a teaching which seemed to them narrow, childish, and wearisome. It has been said that in the language of this passage "we may hear the heavy babbling utterance of the drunken scoffers" (Delitzsch); but in this we have perhaps an over-refinement. Isaiah probably gives us, not what his adversaries said of him over their cups, but the best arguments which they could hit on in their sober hours to depreciate his doe-trine. The arguments must be allowed to be clever.

It is uncertain whether the reference is to the immediate future and to the Assyrians proper only, or whether the Babylonians are not taken into account also, and their oppression of Judaea pointed to. The yoke of Babylon was probably quite as difficult to endure as that of Assyria; and we find that, in the space of eighteen years, it produced at least three rebellions.

The power of the nobles under the later Jewish monarchy is very apparent throughout Isaiah's prophecy. It is they, and not the king, who are always blamed for bad government (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12-15</a>, etc.) or errors of policy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-15.htm">Isaiah 22:15-19</a>, etc.). Isaiah now turns from a denunciation of the priests and prophets, who especially opposed his teaching, to a threatening of the great men who guided the course of public affairs. He taxes them with being "men of scorn" (ver. 14), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> scorners of Jehovah, and with" a proud and insolent self-confidence" (Delitzsch). They have made, or are about to make, secret arrangements which will, they believe, secure Judaea against suffering injury at the hands of the Assyrians, and are quite satisfied with what they have done, and fear no evil. Isaiah is instructed that their boasted arrangements will entirely fail in the time of trial - their "refuge" (Egypt) will be found a refuge of lies (ver. 17), and the "overflowing scourge" (Assyria) will pass through the land, and carry all before it (ver. 18). There will then ensue a time of "vexation" and discomfort (vers. 19, 20) - God's anger will be poured out upon the land in strange ways (ver. 21). He therefore warns the rulers to lay aside their scorn of God, and humble themselves, lest a worse thing happen to them (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye scornful men</span>; literally, ye <span class="accented">men of scorn</span>. The word used is rare, but will be found in the same sense in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a> and Proverbs 29:8. A cognate participle occurs in <a href="../../par/hosea/7-5.htm">Hosea 7:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That rule this people</span>. (On the authority of the nobles at this period, see the introductory paragraph.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/28-15.htm">Isaiah 28:15</a></div><div class="verse">Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have made a covenant with death</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/5-23.htm">Job 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18</a>). The words are a boast, expressed somewhat enigmatically, that they have secured their own safety by some secret agreement. The exact nature of the agreement they are disinclined to divulge. <span class="cmt_word">With hell are we at agreement</span>. A "<span class="accented">synonymous</span> parallelism," merely strengthening the previous assertion. <span class="cmt_word">When the overflowing scourge shall pass through</span>. Assyrian invasion has been compared to a "flood" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>), and to a "rod" or "staff" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>. Here the two metaphors are joined together. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not come to us</span>. Some means will be found - what, they do not say, either for diverting the flood, or for stemming it. <span class="cmt_word">For we have made lies our refuge</span>. Here the Divine reporter departs from the language of those whose words he is reporting, and substitutes his own estimate of the true nature and true value of that "refuge" on which they placed such entire reliance. It appears by <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6-9</a> that that refuge was Egypt. Now, Egypt was a "bruised reed," not to be depended on for keeping her engagements. To trust in her was to put confidence in "lies" and "falsehood." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner <i>stone</i>, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone</span>. In contrast with the insecure refuge and false ground of confidence whereon the nobles relied, the prophet puts forward the one sure "Rock" on which complete dependence may be placed - which he declares that Jehovah is laying, or "has laid," in Zion as <span class="cmt_word">a tried stone, a precious corner stone</span>, a sure foundation. The imagery is, no doubt, drawn from the practice of Oriental kings, and notably Solomon, to employ foundation-stones of enormous size and weight at the corners of buildings. Some of those uncovered at the corners of Solomon's temple by the Palestine Exploration Fund are more than thirty-eight feet long, and weigh above a hundred tons (see 'Our Work in Palestine,' pp. 38, 115). But the reference cannot, of course, be to the material structure of the temple as Israel's true refuge. Rather, Jehovah himself would seem to be the Rock (<a href="../../par/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, etc.) intended; and hence the application to Christ by the writers of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-6.htm">1 Peter 2:6-8</a>) was natural and easy. But it may be questioned whether the passage was to Isaiah himself "Messianic," or meant more than that God had set his Name and his presence at Jerusalem from the time that the temple was built there, and that it was a mistake to look elsewhere titan to him for deliverance or security. <span class="cmt_word">He that believeth shall not make haste</span>. The LXX. have "He that believeth shall not be <span class="accented">ashamed"</span> or "confounded;" and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>) follows this rendering.

Isaiah is always careful to intermingle promises with his threats, comfort with his denunciations. Like his great Master, of whom he prophesied, he was fain not to "break the bruised reed" or "quench the smoking flax." When he had searched men's wounds with the probe, he was careful to pour in oil and wine. So now, having denounced the sinners of Judah through three long paragraphs (vers. 7-22), he has a word of consolation and encouragement for the better disposed, whose hearts he hopes to have touched and stirred by his warning. This consolation he puts in a parabolic form, leaving it to their spiritual insight to discover the meaning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give ye ear</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/49-1.htm">Psalm 49:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-1.htm">Psalm 78:1</a>).

Such instruments are of the coarsest and clumsiest character in the East, and quite inapplicable to plants of a delicate fabric. Karsten Niebuhr thus describes the Arabian and Syrian practices: "Quand le grain dolt etre battu, les Arabes de Yemen posent le bled par terre en deux tangles, epis center epis, apres quoi ils font trainer par-dessus <span class="accented">une grosse pierre</span> tiree par deux boeufs.

The allusion is to aim the coarse mode of threshing practiced in Palestine and elsewhere, by driving a cart with broad wheels over the grain. <span class="cmt_word">But the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod</span>. Canon Tristram says, "While the cummin can easily be separated from its case by a slender rod, the harder pod of the <span class="accented">Nigella</span> requires to be beaten by a stout staff" ('Natural History of the Bible,' p. 445).

Most critics regard the clause as interrogative, "Is bread corn bruised?" - and the answer as given in the negative by the rest of the sentence, "No; he will not continue always threshing it, nor crunch it with his cart-wheel and his horses  - he will not bruise it." Even where the rougher modes of threshing are employed, there is moderation in their employment. Care is taken not to injure the grain. Here the main bearing of the whole parable appears. The afflictions which God sends upon his people are adapted to their strength and to their needs. In no case are they such as to crush and injure. Only such violence is used as is required to detach the good seed from the husks. Where the process is most severe, still the "bread-corn" is not "bruised."

Expostulation is followed by threats. The prophet is aware that all his preaching to the authorities in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-14.htm">Isaiah 28:14-22</a>) will be of no avail, and that their adoption of measures directly antagonistic to the commands of God will bring on the very evil which they are seeking to avert, and cause Jerusalem to be actually besieged by her enemies. In the present passage he distinctly announces the siege, and declares that it will commence within a year. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt</span>! "Ariel' is clearly a mystic name for Jerusalem, parallel to "Sheshach" as a name for Babylon (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>) and "'Ir-ha-heres" as a name for Heliopolis (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>). It is generally explained as equivalent to Art-El, "lion of God;" but Delitzsch suggests the meaning of "hearth of God," or "altar of God," a signification which "Ariel" seems to have in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-15.htm">Ezekiel 43:15, 16</a>. But there is no evidence that "Ariel" was ever employed in this sense before the time of Ezekiel. Etymologically, "Ariel" can only mean "lion of God," and the name would in this sense be sufficiently descriptive of the Jewish capital, which had always hitherto been a sort of champion of Jehovah - a warrior fighting his battles with a lion's courage and fierceness. <span class="cmt_word">Dwelt</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pitched his</span> tent - an expression recalling the old tent-life of the Hebrews (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And ye year to year</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">year to a year</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the coming year to the present one.

The best modern authorities translate, "Let <span class="accented">the feasts run their round"</span> (Kay, Cheyne, Delitzsch); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let there be one more round of the annual festival-times, and then let the enemy march in and commence the siege.

The sense runs on from the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">There shall be heaviness and sorrow.</span> Mr. Cheyne's "moaning and bemoaning" represents the Hebrew play upon words better. The natural consequence of the siege would be a constant cry of woe. <span class="cmt_word">And it shall be unto me as Ariel</span>. It would be better to translate, "Yet she shall be unto me as Ariel." The meaning is that, though distressed and straitened, Jerusalem shall still through all be able by God's help to answer to her name of "Ariel" - to behave as a lien when attacked by the hunters.

There was small chance of forcing an entrance into Jerusalem on any side except the north; but, order to distress and harass her, an enemy with numerous forces would dispose them all round the walls, thus preventing all ingress or egress (see <a href="../../par/luke/19-43.htm">Luke 19:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And... lay siege against thee with a mount</span>; or, <span class="accented">with a mound</span>. Artificial mounds were raised up against the walls of cities by the Assyrians, as a foundation from which to work their battering rams with greater advantage against the upper and weaker portion of the defenses (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 80). <span class="cmt_word">And... raise forts against thee.</span> "Forts" were usually movable, and accompanied the battering-ram for its better protection. Archers in the forts cleared the walls of their defenders, while the ram was employed in making a breach (see Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' Second Series, p. 21).

The feeble cries of a people wasted and worn out by a long siege are intended. These cries would resemble those which seemed to come out of the ground when a necromancer professed to raise a ghost. The Hebrew '<span class="accented">ohv</span> is used both of the necromancers (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>, etc.) and of the ghosts which they professed to raise (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>, etc.).

It is ever God's care to prevent men from being "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>). As long as he is not about to "make a full end" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>), he mingles promises with his threats, words of cheer with words of warning. So now the prophet is directed to attach to his four verses of denunciation (vers. 1-4) four others of encouragement, and to declare the utter discomfiture of the vast host of enemies which for a time has besieged and "distressed" Ariel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span>. The relation of vers. 5-8 to vers. 1-4 is that of contrast. The multitude of thy strangers; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of thy enemies" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5</a>). In primitive societies every stranger is an enemy; and hence language - the formation of primitive men - often has one word for the two ideas. In Latin <span class="accented">hostis</span> is said to have originally meant "foreigner" (Cic., 'De Off',' 1:12). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be like small dust</span>. Ground down, <span class="accented">i.e. to</span> an impalpable powder  - rendered utterly weak and powerless. The meaning is determined by the clause which follows, with which it must necessarily be in close accordance. <span class="cmt_word">As chaff that passeth away</span>. "Chaff," in Scripture, is always a metaphor for weakness (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-13.htm">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-11.htm">Isaiah 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>; and see also <a href="../../par/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-2.htm">Zephaniah 2:2</a>). It has no value; man's object is to get rid of it: a light wind carries it away, and no one inquires whither. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</span> Dr. Kay says it is "the collapse of Jerusalem" which is here intended. But most other commentators understand, with more reason, the collapse of her enemies (Cheyne, Delitzsch, Vance Smith, Knobel, etc.).

On whom the visitation will fall is not expressed; but the context shows that it is on the enemies of Judah. The terrible nature of the visitation is signified by an enumeration of the most fearful of God's judgments - "thunder, earthquake, great noise, whirlwind, tern-pest, and a flame of devouring fire." <span class="accented">All</span> the expressions are probably metaphorical.

"The baseless fabric of a vision," when it has once passed by, "leaves not wrack behind." The entire host of the "terrible ones" would melt away and disappear, as a night vision before the light of day - it would dissolve into nothing, vanish, leave no trace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a></div><div class="verse">It shall even be as when an hungry <i>man</i> dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, <i>he is</i> faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be even as when an hungry man dreameth</span>. The melting away of the vision would involve a keen disappointment. The enemies of Israel had expected to secure a most valuable prey. They had dreamed of a rich booty when they should take the city - a booty which would reward them for all the hardships of their marches, their watches, their toils in the siege, the dangers to which they exposed themselves in the assaults. It was as if a hungry man had dreamed that he was engaged in a feast, or a thirsty man that he was drinking deep at a banquet, when suddenly he wakes up, and finds that he has been merely dreaming, and that there is no reality in his fancies. Dr. Kay quotes a passage which is much to the point from Mungo Park's journals: "No sooner had I shut my eyes than fancy would convey me to the streams and rivers of my native land. There, as I wandered along the verdant bank, I surveyed the clear streams with transport, and hastened to swallow the delightful draught; but, alas! disappointment awaked me, and I found myself a lonely captive, perishing of thirst amid the wilds of Africa." Those engaged in the siege, while themselves vanishing away, would likewise find their dreams of plunder vanish, and Would bitterly feel the disappointment. <span class="cmt_word">That fight against Mount Zion.</span> To attack Jerusalem was to fight against the mount of God, the place where Jehovah had "set his Name, "and where he condescended in some true sense to <span class="accented">dwell</span> continually.

It was among the most painful circumstances attaching to the prophetical office, that scarcely ever was the prophet held in any esteem among his own people, or in his own lifetime. Isaiah knows that his warning will fall dead - that the people and their rulers have neither "eyes to see" nor "ears to hear." He places on record this knowledge, while at the same time striving if by any means he may arouse some from their condition of dull apathy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stay yourselves, and wonder</span>; rather, <span class="accented">stand stupefied and be astonished</span>. The prophet bids them act as he knows that they will act. They will simply "stare with astonishment" at a prophecy which will seem to them "out of all relation to facts" (Cheyne). They will not yield it the slightest credence. They will only marvel how a sane man could have uttered such egregious folly. <span class="cmt_word">Cry ye out, and cry</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "Blind yourselves, and be blind," which certainly gives a much better sense, and is justified by the use of the same verb in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>. As Pharaoh began by hardening his own heart, and then God hardened it ('Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, pp. 103, 166, 203, etc.), so those who blind their own eyes, and will not see when they have the power, are, in the end, if they persist, judicially blinded by God. <span class="cmt_word">They are drunken, but not with wine.</span> "The drunkards of Ephraim" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>) were such literally. They "erred through strong drink" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>); they "were swallowed up of wine;" but the case was different with the infatuated ones of Judah. They were morally, not physically, intoxicated. Their pride and self-trust rendered them as irrational and as unimpressionable as ever drunkenness rendered any man; but they were not actual drunkards.

But here it is "spiritual deadness and impassiveness" - an inability to appreciate, or even to understand, spiritual warnings. The Jews of Isaiah's time were sunk in a spiritual lethargy, from which he vainly endeavored to arouse them. This spiritual lethargy is here said to have been "poured out upon them by Jehovah;" but we are not to suppose that there was anything exceptional in their treatment - "because they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>), as he does men generally. <span class="cmt_word">Hath closed your eyes</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; and see also <a href="../../par/matthew/12-13.htm">Matthew 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-10.htm">Luke 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-8.htm">John 11:8</a>, etc.). The prophets. As the text stands, the proper translation would be, "For the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes (the prophets), and your heads (the seers) hath he covered." But it is reasonably conjectured that the expressions, "the prophets," "the seers," are glosses, which have crept from the margin into the text (Eichhorn, Koppe, Cheyne). If so, they are probably mistaken glosses, the allusion being, not to particular classes, but to the actual "heads" and "eyes" of individual Hebrews, which were "closed" and "covered" by the judicial action of the Almighty. In the East a covering is often drawn over the head during sleep.

Even the rulers were but "blind loaders of the blind." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/29-12.htm">Isaiah 29:12</a></div><div class="verse">And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Him that is not learned</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that cannot read writing." Even in our Lord's day the ordinary Jew was not taught to read and write. Hence the surprise of the rulers at his teaching the people out of the Law (<a href="../../par/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>, "How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near <i>me</i> with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore the Lord said</span>; rather, <span class="accented">moreover the Lord said</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>This people draw near me with their mouth.</span> Samaria had been punished for open idolatry and flagrant neglect of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-17</a>). Jerusalem had not gone these lengths. She still, in profession, clung to the worship of Jehovah, and had even recently accepted a purification of religion at the hand of Hezekiah, who had "removed the high places," and cut down the groves, and broken in pieces the brazen serpent," because the people burnt incense to it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). But her religion was a <span class="accented">mere</span> lip-service, which God detested - it was outward, formal, hypocritical (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). Jerusalem, therefore, no less than Samaria, deserved and would receive a severe chastisement. But have removed their heart far from me. Here lies the gist of the charge. It was not that there was too much outward religion, but that there was no inward religion corresponding to it. Lip-service without inward religion is a mockery, though it is not always felt as such. <span class="cmt_word">Their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men</span>. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that ritual books had been already published by the authority of the priests, and that these were followed, on account of the human authority which had issued them, without any reference to the Law. Thus ritual obedience became mere obedience to "the precept of men." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, <i>even</i> a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise <i>men</i> shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent <i>men</i> shall be hid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will proceed to do a marvelous work</span>. Commentators are not agreed what this "marvelous work" was. Some, with Delitzsch, consider it to be the hardening of the hearts of the Jews to such an extent that even the appearance of wisdom and understanding, which the rulers of the people had hitherto retained, would completely disappear. Others, with Mr. Cheyne, regard it as the coming siege, with those extreme sufferings and perils (vers. 3, 4) which the Jews would have to undergo - sufferings and perils barely consistent with the previous covenant-promises made to the nation. It is difficult to decide between these two views; but, on the whole, Mr. Cheyne's view seems preferable. <span class="cmt_word">A marvelous work and a wonder</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">marvelous work and a marvel</span>. The repetition is for the sake of emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">For the wisdom</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the wisdom</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "when I do my marvel, <span class="accented">then</span> the wisdom of the wise men shall perish" - all their crafty designs and plans shall be of no avail, but come wholly to naught. The chief of these designs was that alluded to in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/29-15.htm">Isaiah 29:15</a></div><div class="verse">Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord</span>. The allusion is to the schemes which were afloat for calling in the aid of Egypt. As Isaiah had long since denounced these schemes as the height of folly (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-11.htm">Isaiah 19:11-17</a>), and prophesied their failure (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5, 6</a>), every effort was made to conceal them from his knowledge end from the knowledge of all who were like-minded (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>). Steps were probably even now being taken for the carrying out of the schemes, which were studiously concealed from the prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Their works are in the dark.</span> Underhand proceedings ere at all times suspicious. "Men love darkness rather than light, <span class="accented">because their deeds are evil</span>." The very fact of concealment was an indication that the works in which the rulers were engaged were evil, and that they knew them to be evil. <span class="cmt_word">They say, Who seeth us?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>, "Tush, they say, How should God perceive? Is there knowledge in the Most High?"). The wicked persuade themselves that God does not see their actions.

God's judgment (ver. 14), whatever it is, will pass. In a little while there will be a great change. The lowly will be exalted, the proud abased.

Having shown to Israel the vision of a far-distant future, when holiness and peace would reign upon the earth, and "the mountain of the Lord's house" would draw all men into it, the prophet returns to things as they are - first exhorting Israel to "walk in the light of Jehovah' (ver. 5), and then showing how far they have withdrawn from the light; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by magical practices (ver. 6); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by commercial greed (vers. 6, 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by ostentation and luxury (ver. 7); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> by idolatry (ver. 8). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such being the case, punishment must come - mean and great must be equally brought low (ver. 9) - the people must fly to their cave-fastnesses (ver. 10), and hide themselves; they must be humiliated to the uttermost (ver. 11). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O house of Jacob</span>. "House of Jacob" is the common expression in Isaiah, instead of "house of Israel" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-1.htm">Isaiah 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-22.htm">Isaiah 29:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-3.htm">Isaiah 46:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a>). It has no particular force, merely signifying "Israelites." <span class="cmt_word">Come ye, and let us walk.</span> The same words as those of the "nations" in ver. 3, "Come ye, and let us go up." As the nations will invite each other "in the last days," so the prophet now invites his countrymen to walk with God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and <i>are</i> soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for</span>. The prophet, in calling upon Israel to "walk in the light of the Lord," implies that they are not so walking. He then proceeds to give the reasons of this. They are not, "for God has forsaken them, or, cast them off." The first reason is <span class="cmt_word">because they be replenished from the east</span> (Revised Version,  "they be filled <span class="accented">with customs</span> from the east); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they have adopted a number of Syrian, Assyrian, and Ammonite superstitions; e.g. high places, images, and "groves," the burning of their children in honor of Moloch, the use of divination and enchantment, etc. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10-12, 16, 17</a>, etc.). Most of these practices reached the Israelites from Syria, though many had their origin either in Assyria or Babylonia. <span class="cmt_word">Soothsayers</span>, <span class="cmt_word">like the Philistines.</span> The "diviners" of the Philistines are mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-2.htm">1 Samuel 6:2</a>. By the word here employed, it would seem that they foretold the future from observations on the clouds and the general appearance of the sky. During the reign of Uzziah, the Israelites had been brought into closer contact with the Philistines than usual, through his conquest of several of their cities (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They please themselves in the children of strangers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">strike hands with the children of strangers</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/27-23.htm">Job 27:23</a>). This is thought to refer to striking hands upon a bargain (Cheyne), and to be an allusion to the commercial activity of the reigns of Uzziah and Jotham (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>).

The results of the commercial activity - not evil things in themselves, but probably acquired by sharp dealing, and leading to undue softness and luxury. The Law had given a warning against "greatly multiplying silver and gold" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). For the fact of the vast abundance of the precious metals in Judaea at this time, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-16.htm">2 Kings 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>; and compare Sennacherib's inscription on the Taylor Cylinder ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. p. 163, 2nd edit.). <span class="cmt_word">Full of horses... chariots</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10</a>). There is no reason to believe that the Jews or Israelites ever possessed (unless it were under Solomon) any considerable cavalry or chariot force. But from the time of David horses and chariots were imported for convenience and for show by the kings, the princes, and the nobles (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-31.htm">1 Kings 22:31</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:7</a>).

(It is, perhaps, alluded to in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>; and the fact of its prevalence is stated in <a href="../../par/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-13.htm">Micah 5:13</a>.)

The transition from narrative to threatening comes best at the beginning of the verse.

It is usual to take this metaphorically; and no doubt men are often compared to trees in Scripture (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/8-16.htm">Job 8:16, 17</a>), and "cedars of Lebanon" especially are symbols of the great and proud ones (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a>). But it has been well observed that either <span class="accented">all</span> the details of the description in the text must be taken literally, or <span class="accented">all</span> of them metaphorically, and that the mention of such objects as "ships of Tarshish" and "pleasant pictures" pleads strongly for a literal interpretation. The day of the Lord was upon the cedars when Sennacherib "with chariots upon chariots came up to the height of the mountains, to the <span class="accented">sides of Lebanon</span>, and <span class="accented">cut down the tall cedars thereof</span>, and the choice fir trees thereof" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>); and similar devastation accompanied, it is probable, the other invasions of the Assyrians (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. pp. 474, 475). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all the oaks of Bashan</span>. The "oaks of Bashan" are celebrated also by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>) and by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>).

Uzziah and. Jotham had, both of them, paid much attention to fortifications, and had especially "built towers," both at Jerusalem and in other parts of Judaea (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>).

Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a>) and Micah (<a href="../../par/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>) also notice the trust of Judah in her fortresses, and threaten their destruction.

Tarshish was Tartessus, in Spain, and voyages thither were regarded as long and dangerous (Herod., 1:163). Consequently, the ships which were built for the Tartessian trade were of unusual size and strength. Uzziah had "built [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> rebuilt] Elath," in the eastern arm of the Red Sea, early in his reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>), and no doubt maintained a fleet there, as Jehoshaphat had done (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>). Elath remained in the possession of the Jews till the reign of Ahaz, when it was taken by Rezin, and restored to Edom (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Upon all pleasant pictures</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">all pleasant imagery</span>. The exact word here translated "pictures" does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament; but a cognate word is not uncommon.

More than this can scarcely be determined. Dr. Kay thinks the term to include "sculptures and fresco-paintings." Mr. Cheyne translates "all delightful works of imagery." The sentiment is that the judgment of God will fall on the most valued contents of palaces and grand houses, no less than upon the forests and the mountains, the fortified places, and the national navy. <span class="accented">All</span> wilt be involved in one sweeping destruction.

This verse interrupts the sequence of the thoughts somewhat awkwardly. It is a sort of refrain (see ver. 11; and for the use of refrains in Hebrew poetry, see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1, 21</a>; Psalm evil. 8, 15, 21, 31), and perhaps comes in for rhythmical reasons, to the detriment of the sense.

While the visitation shall fall only partially on the other objects precious to Israel - the cedars, the oaks, the terraced mountains and hills, the strongholds, the ships, and the works of art - the idols shall be wholly swept away by it. It is impossible to say what visitation exactly was in the prophet's mind; but if we may suppose that the Babylonian captivity came within the range of the prophetic vision, we must pronounce the prediction to have received a very remarkable fulfillment in this matter, since that calamity did put an <span class="accented">entire</span> end to the idolatry of the nation.

A passage of Habakkuk (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>) shows that sometimes the main bulk of the idol was of stone, which was overlaid with a coating of one or other of the two precious metals; but it would seem that ordinarily the entire image was either of gold or silver (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>).

If retained, it must be regarded as an appeal to Israel on the part of the prophet to give up their trust in man, whence had flowed all their other errors. <span class="cmt_word">Whose breath is in his nostrils</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "whose life is a mere breath; who, if he ceases to breathe, ceases to live." <span class="cmt_word">For wherein is he to be accounted of?</span> or, <span class="accented">for of what account is he?</span> Surely, of no account at all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/30.htm"><title>Isaiah 30 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/30.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/30.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/30-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/29.htm" title="Isaiah 29">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 30 <a href="../isaiah/31.htm" title="Isaiah 31">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a></div><div class="verse">Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to the rebellious children</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>). The word translated "rebellious" is used in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18, 20</a> of the persistently disobedient son, who was to be brought before the elders and stoned to death. <span class="cmt_word">That take counsel</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that form plans</span>, such as the plan now formed to call in the aid of Egypt. It must be borne in mind that, under the theocracy, there was an authorized mode of consulting God, and receiving an answer from him, in any political emergency. <span class="cmt_word">That cover with a covering.</span> The exact metaphor employed is uncertain, Mr. Cheyne renders, "that weave a web;" Dr. Kay, "that pour out a molten image." The meaning, however, in any case is, "that carry out a design," the clause being a mere variant of the preceding one. <span class="cmt_word">That they may add sin to sin</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to add a fresh sin to all their former sins."

Either the Jewish ambassadors have already started, or the anticipatory vision of the prophet sees them as if starting. In the history (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1-22</a>) it is not expressly said that Hezekiah made application to Egypt for aid; but the reproaches of Rabshakeh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21, 24</a>) would be pointless if he had not done so. <span class="cmt_word">Have not asked at my mouth</span>. As they ought to have done (see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh</span>. It is very uncertain who is the "Pharaoh" here intended. The supreme power over Egypt was probably, at the time, in the hands of Tirkakah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9</a>); but Lower Egypt seems to have been ruled by various princes, the chief of whom was Shabatok, and any one of these may have been regarded by Isaiah as a "Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">To trust in the shadow of Egypt.</span> Trust in the "shadow of God" was an expression very familiar to the Jews (see <a href="../../par/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-7.htm">Psalm 63:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>). To "trust in the shadow of Egypt" was to put Egypt in the place of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-3.htm">Isaiah 30:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt <i>your</i> confusion.</div><div class="comm">

"Zoan" is undoubtedly Tanis, which is now "San," a heap of ruins in the Delta, where some interesting remains of the shepherd-kings have been discovered. It was a favorite capital of the monarchs of the nineteenth dynasty, and seems to have been the scene of the struggle between Moses and the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12, 43</a>). It then declined, but is said to have been the birthplace of the first king of the twenty-first dynasty. In the Ethiopian period it rose once more to some importance, and was at one time the capital of a principality (see G. Smith's 'Asshur-bani-pal,' pp. 21, 26, 32). The "<span class="accented">princes"</span> here spoken of are probably Hezekiah's ambassadors. <span class="cmt_word">His ambassadors came to Hanes</span>. "Hanes" has been generally identified with the modern Esnes, a village between Memphis and Thebes, which is thought to mark the site of Hera-cleopolis Magna. But it has been well remarked that the Jewish envoys would scarcely have proceeded so far. Mr. R.S. Peele suggests, instead of Esnes, Tahpenes, or Daphnae ('Dict. of the Bible,' vol. 1. p. 753); but that name is somewhat remote from Hanes. Perhaps it would be best to acknowledge that "Hanes" cannot at present be identified. It was probably not very far from Tanis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-5.htm">Isaiah 30:5</a></div><div class="verse">They were all ashamed of a people <i>that</i> could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They were all ashamed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all are ashamed</span>. The reference is not to the ambassadors, who felt no shame in their embassy, and probably returned elated by the promises made them; but to the subsequent feelings of the Jewish nation, when it was discovered by sad experience that no reliance was to be placed on "the strength of Pharaoh." <span class="cmt_word">A people that could not profit</span> <span class="cmt_word">them</span>. Mr. Cheyne compares, very pertinently, an inscription of Sargon's, where he says of the people of Philistia, Judah, Edom, and Moab, that "they and their evil chiefs, to fight against me, unto Pharaoh, King of Egypt, <span class="accented">a monarch who could not save them</span>, their presents carried, and besought his alliance" (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 130, II. 35-39). Egypt was, in fact, quite unable to cope with Assyria, and knew it. <span class="cmt_word">A shame, and also a reproach</span>. A matter of which they would themselves be "ashamed," and with which the Assyrians would "reproach" them (as they did, <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21, 24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a></div><div class="verse">The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence <i>come</i> the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people <i>that</i> shall not profit <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Burden of the beasts of the south</span>. Delitzsch thinks that the Egyptians are intended by the "beasts of the south" - the expression pointing primarily to the hippopotamus, which was an apt emblem of the slow-moving Egyptians. But most commentators regard the "beasts" of this clause as equivalent to the "<span class="accented">young</span> asses and camels" mentioned towards the end of the verse. (On the sense of the word "burden," see the introductory paragraph to <a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Into the lane of trouble and anguish</span>; rather, <span class="accented">through a laud</span>. It is not Egypt that is spoken of, but the desert between Judaea and Egypt. The reminiscences of this desert were such that the Israelites always exaggerated its terrors and dangers (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come the young and old lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the lioness and the lion</span> (see 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; vol. 1. p. 227). Lions can never have been numerous in the tract in question; but they may have haunted portions of it, when it was better watered than at present. <span class="cmt_word">The viper and fiery flying serpent</span>. Snakes of various kinds have always been abundant in the desert between Judaea and Egypt (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>; Strab., 16. p. 759; Schubert,' Travels,' sol. it. p. 406; Burckhardt, 'Travels,' p. 499, etc.). Seine of them were believed anciently to have wings (Herod., 2:75; 3:107); but the fact is doubted. Isaiah is not concerned with natural history, but with definitely marking out the locality through which the ambassadors would march. For this purpose it was best to describe it in terms drawn from the popular belief. <span class="cmt_word">Their riches... their treasures</span>. Ambassadors who came to request military aid, as a matter of course carried rich presents with them. <span class="cmt_word">Young asses... camels.</span> The ordinary beasts of burden employed in the passage of the desert (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-26.htm">Genesis 42:26</a>; Herod., 3:9, etc.).

Most translate, "Wherefore I name it" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Egypt) "Rahab, that sits still;" or "Arrogance, that 'sits still." Rahab, "pride" or 'arrogance," would seem to have been an old name for Egypt (<a href="../../par/job/26-12.htm">Job 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>), not one given at this time by Isaiah. What he means to say is, "Proud as thou art, thou doest nothing to maintain thy pride, but art content with sitting still." This he "cries" or "proclaims" concerning Egypt, as the most important thing for other nations to know about her.

The denunciation of the Egyptian alliance had been made <span class="accented">viva voce</span>, in the courts of the temple or in some other place of public resort. As he ended, Isaiah received a Divine intimation that the prophecy was to be put on record, doubly, upon a tablet and in a book. At the same time, the "<span class="accented">rebelliousness"</span> of the people was further pointed out, and fresh threats (vers. 13, 14, and 17) were uttered against them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Write it before them in a tablet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> write the prophecy before them" (equivalent to "<span class="accented">to</span> be set up before them") "<span class="accented">on a</span> tablet," in the briefest possible form (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And note it in a book</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "and also make a full notation of it in a book," or parchment roll. The "tablet" was to be for the admonition of the living generation of men; the "book" was for future generations, to be a record of God's omniscience and faithfulness "forever and ever." <span class="cmt_word">That it may be for the time to come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for an after-day - not</span> for the immediate present only. <span class="cmt_word">For ever and ever</span>. Modern critics observe that the phrase, <span class="accented">la'ad</span> '<span class="accented">ad</span> '<span class="accented">olam</span>, never occurs elsewhere, and suggest a change of the pointing, which would give the sense of "for a testimony forever." Whether we accept the change or not, the meaning undoubtedly is that consigning the prophecy to a "book" would make an appeal to it possible <span class="accented">in perpetuum</span>. The perpetuity of the written Word is assumed as certain.

"The Holy One of Israel" was one of Isaiah's most frequent names for the Almighty. He used it especially when rebuking Israel's unholiness (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>, etc.). The irreligious Jews were weary of this constant iteration, and wished to hear no more concerning this "Holy One," whose very holiness was a reproach to them.

The "word" intended is probably the prophecy against trusting in Egypt (vers. 1-7). <span class="cmt_word">And trust in oppression</span>; or, <span class="accented">extortion</span>. Oppressive measures employed to obtain the rich gifts which had to be sent into Egypt (ver. 6) are probably intended (setup. <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a>). Gratz and Cheyne change the reading from '<span class="accented">oshek</span> to '<span class="accented">ikkesh</span> ("perverseness"); but without any necessity. <span class="cmt_word">And perverseness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">crookedness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "tortuous policy" (Kay). <span class="cmt_word">And stay thereon</span>; rather, <span class="accented">lean</span> or <span class="accented">stay yourselves thereon</span>.

Isaiah is fond of mixed metaphors, and of superseding one metaphor by another. From comparing Judah's fall and ruin to the shattering of a lofty wall, he suddenly turns to a comparison of it with the breaking to pieces of an earthen pitcher. Judah shall be so broken as when the pitcher is crushed into minute fragments, so that there is no piece large enough to convey a coal from one fire for the lighting of another, or to be of even the least use for drawing water from a well. A complete dissolution of the political fabric is foreshadowed, such as did not actually take effect till the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar.

The conditions are put forward, not as now capable of being realized, but as those which might have been realized at an earlier date. The "returning" spoken of is an abandonment of the course hitherto pursued, which was reckless provocation of Assyria and trust in Egypt. The "rest" is staying upon God - renunciation of trust on any arm of flesh, and simple reliance on the Divine aid, as sure to be sufficient when the need came. <span class="cmt_word">In quietness and confidence shall be your strength</span>; rather, <span class="accented">should be</span>.

The denunciations of the preceding passage (vers. 9-17) had been so terrible that, without some counterpoise of promise, they must have produced a general despair. This was not the Divine purpose. Judah's probation still continued. Therefore it was necessary to let it be seen that the Divine long-suffering was not yet exhausted - there were still conditions under which God would be gracious to his people. The conditions were "crying to the Lord" (ver. 19), and entire abolition of idolatry (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>. "Because your sins require this chastisement" (Kay); "Because of the extremity of your need" (Cheyne). It is, perhaps, best to own that the motives of the Divine action are very commonly obscure; and, if seen clearly by the prophets, are certainly not clearly set forth, being (it may be) inscrutable. While the motive, however, is obscure, the promise is plain and unmistakable, <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will wait, that he may be gracious unto you.</span> God is not about at present to "make a full end;" he is bent on "waiting" - his intent is "to be gracious." He will be exalted, that he may have mercy. He will find some means of vindicating his honor and exalting himself, short of your destruction, in order that it may be open to him to give you a further chance of repentance, whereby you would obtain mercy. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord is a God of judgment</span>. God is essentially just; <span class="accented">sin must</span> receive punishment; but the punishment may be short of destruction. Justice does not exclude mercy.

Evidently the Jews had, in many cases, secretly maintained their idols and their idolatrous practices, despite the efforts of Hezekiah.

Isaiah means to say, "As the Tophet of the Vale of Hinnom is prepared for a king (Moloch), so this new Tophet is prepared for another king (the King of Assyria)." <span class="cmt_word">He hath made it deep and large</span> - a vast burning-place for a vast multitude (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), with the <span class="cmt_word">fire and the wood</span> ready, only <span class="cmt_word">awaiting the breath of Jehovah to kindle it</span>. As the bodies of great malefactors were burnt (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>), and not buried, so the prophet consigns to a great burning the hundred and eighty-five thousand Assyrian corpses, of which it would soon be necessary to dispose in some way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/29.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 29"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 29" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/31.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 31"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 31" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/31.htm"><title>Isaiah 31 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/31.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/31.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/31-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/30.htm" title="Isaiah 30">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 31 <a href="../isaiah/32.htm" title="Isaiah 32">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a></div><div class="verse">Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because <i>they are</i> many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - A FURTHER WARNING AGAINST SEEKING THE ALLIANCE OF EGYPT. This prophecy seems to be quite independent of the last (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>). It may have been given earlier or later. The chief point brought out, which had not distinctly appeared previously, is the value set on the horses and chariots of Egypt in the conflict with Assyria (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1, 2</a>; and see also the earlier prophecy, <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-6</a>). The examples of Samaria, Gaza, and Ashdod might well have taught the lesson of distrust of Egypt, without any Divine warnings (see G. Smith's 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 125-131). But the Jews were infatuated, and relied on Egypt despite her previous failures to give effective aid. <span class="cmt_word">And stay on horses</span>. The Assyrian cavalry was very numerous, and very efficient. It is often represented on the monuments. Egyptian cavalry, on the other hand, is not represented at all; and it may be questioned whether, in the early times, the Egyptian war-horses were not entirely employed in the chariot-service (see 'Pulpit Commentary' on Exodus, p. 321). The later dynasties of Egyptian kings, however, employed cavalry, as appears from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; Herod., 2:162; 'Records of the Past,' vol. it. pp. 68, 70, 72, etc. <span class="cmt_word">And trust in chariots, because they are many</span>. The large number of the chariots maintained by the Pharaohs is abundantly evidenced. Diodorus assigns to Sesostris twenty-seven thousand (1. 54, &sect; 4). This is, no doubt, an exaggeration; but the six hundred of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), and even the one thousand two hundred of Shishak(<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>) are moderate computations, quite in accord with the monuments, and with all that we otherwise know of Egyptian warfare. Egypt exported chariots to the neighboring countries (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>), and was at this time the only power which seemed capable of furnishing such a chariot-force as could hope to contend on tolerably even terms with the force of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">They look not unto the Holy One of Israel</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-11.htm">Isaiah 30:11, 12</a>). The trust in the Egyptian alliance was accompanied by a distrust of Jehovah and his power, and a disinclination to look to him for aid.

Intense irony. "Wisdom is not wholly confined to the human counselors whose advice Judah follows (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a>).

Judah relied on Pharaoh, as on a sort of God, which indeed he was considered in his own country ('Records of the Past,' vol. 6. p. 145, I. 320; p. 148, 1.418, etc.). Isaiah asserts the contrary in the strongest way: the Egyptians, one and all, are men - mere men; and "there is no help in them" (<a href="../../par/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their horses flesh, and not spirit</span>. The horses, on which so much reliance was placed, were mere animals, subject to all the weakness of the animal nature, not spirit-horses, with a life and vigor of their own, by which they could be a real tower of strength to those on whose side they ranged themselves. <span class="cmt_word">They all shall fail together</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the helpers and the helped (compare the concluding clauses of ver. 2).

In the promise of protection (vers. 4, 5) there is nothing new but the imagery, which is of remarkable beauty. The promise is followed by a brief exhortation (vers. 6, 7); and then the discomfiture of Assyria is declared in the plainest terms, and her flight before the avenging sword of God (vers. 8, 9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like as the lion</span>, etc. The resemblance of this simile to Hem., 'Iliad,' 18:11. 161, 162, has been often noticed. In both, the lion has seized his prey, and is crouching over it; the shepherds gather themselves together against him, and seek to scare him away; but he remains firm, undaunted by their threats and cries, never for a moment relinquishing the body of which he has made himself the master. The image is best explained as representing Jehovah, standing over and keeping guard on Jerusalem, which he will allow, no one to rend from him. <span class="cmt_word">And the young lion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">even the young lion</span> (Lowth).

If we connect the concluding words of the clause with <span class="accented">tsaba</span>, to fight, the meaning must be "fight against," as Delitzsch shows conclusively. But we may connect them with the more distant <span class="accented">yered</span>, will descend, in which case they will mean "on," or "<span class="accented">upon</span> Mount Zion" (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>). The best commentators are of opinion that this <span class="accented">must be</span> the sense. The words are a promise, not a threat.

It is generally allowed that this prophecy is Messianic; but some critics insist that it is not so "in a narrow sense." They regard Isaiah as expecting Messiah's kingdom to follow immediately on the discomfiture of Sennacherib, and as looking to Hezekiah to inaugurate it. According to this view, Hezekiah, renovated in character, was to be the Messiah, and might have been so had he been "equal to the demands providentially made upon him." But he was not; and the task of establishing the kingdom fell to "another," at a later date. It is simpler to regard the prophet as looking for a greater than Hezekiah (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>), but ignorant how soon, or how late, his coming would be. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A king... princes</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "the king... the princes;" but the Hebrew gives no article. The announcement is vague, and corresponds to those of other prophets, as of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>), "Behold, the days come that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a king shall reign and prosper;" and of Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>), "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion... behold, thy <span class="accented">King</span> cometh unto thee." The "princes" of the text are the minor authorities whom the king would set over his kingdom - i.e., the apostles and their successors. <span class="cmt_word">In righteousness... in judgment</span>. Messiah's rule will be a rule of strict justice and right, offering the strongest contrast to that under which the Jews have been living since the time of Jehoshaphat (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1-12</a>, etc.).

It might seem at first sight as if we had here a detached utterance of the prophet, accidentally conjoined with the preceding passage (vers. 1-8). But vers. 15-18 furnish a link of connection between the two portions of the chapter, and make it probable that they were delivered at the same time. Mr. Cheyne supposes that the indifference of a knot of women, gathered at some little distance from the men to whom Isaiah had addressed vers. 1-8, provoked the prophet suddenly to turn to them, and speak to them in terms of warning. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rise up</span>. The "careless daughters" are sitting, or reclining upon couches, at their ease. The prophet bids them stand up, to hear a message from God (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/3-10.htm">Judges 3:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye women that are at ease</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that are self-satisfied and self-complacent." The word employed has almost always a bad sense (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-5.htm">Job 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/123-4.htm">Psalm 123:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-15.htm">Zechariah 1:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hear my voice</span>. This clause should be attached to the first half of the verse.

The object of the prophet is not to fix the duration of the trouble, but to mark the time of its commencement (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye be troubled</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall ye tremble</span>, or <span class="accented">shudder</span> (so <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/77-18.htm">Psalm 77:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-2.htm">Isaiah 64:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-9.htm">Jeremiah 33:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Ye careless women</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye confident ones</span>. The word is different from that employed in vers. 9 and 11. <span class="cmt_word">The vintage shall fail</span>; literally, <span class="accented">has failed -</span> "the perfect of prophetic certitude" (Cheyne). Some critics understand a literal failure, or destruction, of the vintage through the invasion of the Assyrians. Others suggest a refer-once to <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4-7</a>. The vineyard of the Lord (Judah) has utterly failed to bring forth grapes - there is no ingathering - therefore destruction shall fall upon it.

(so the LXX., the Vulgate, Jarchi, Gesenius, Ewald, Maurer, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne). Dr. Kay prefers the rendering of the Authorized Version, understanding by "the teats" such "dry breasts" as Hosea speaks of (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>).

The women require, like the men, to be both warned and comforted, wherefore the prophet addresses to them, as to the men in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>. and 31, an intermixture of threatening (vers. 13, 14) with promise (vers. 15-20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briars.</span> This was the punishment with which the unfruitful vineyard was threatened in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>.

The prophet sees in vision Jerusalem deserted by her inhabitants, the grand houses of the rich empty, the strongholds haunted by wild beasts, and the slopes of the hills fed on by sheep, and even occasionally visited by the timid and solitude-loving wild ass. The description suits well the time of the Babylonian captivity, but not any earlier period. Probably it was not revealed to the prophet how soon the condition would be reached. <span class="cmt_word">The multitude of the city shall be left</span>. The real meaning is, as Bishop Lowth expresses it, "The populous city shall be left desolate." But the whole passage is. as Delitzsch observes, "grammatically strange, the language becoming more complicated, disjointed, and difficult, the greater the wrath and indignation of the poet." <span class="cmt_word">The forts and towers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hill and tower</span>, with (perhaps) a special reference to the part of Jerusalem called Ophel (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, etc.), the long projecting spur from the eastern hill, which points a little west of south, and separates the Kedron valley from the Tyropoeon. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be for dens</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for caves</span>; but dens for wild beasts seem to be meant (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For ever</span>. This expression must not be pressed. Hyperbole is a recognized feature of poetry written under strong excitement. <span class="cmt_word">A joy of wild asses</span>. The wild ass is not now found nearer Palestine than Mesopotamia, or perhaps Northern Syria. It is exceedingly shy, and never approaches the habitations of men.

The expression "until" modifies the previous "forever," showing that the desolation was <span class="accented">not</span> always to continue. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit be poured upon us from on high.</span> An effluence from the Holy Spirit of God on individuals of eminence, prophets, kings, artificers, to fit them for their tasks, is recognized in many of the earlier books of Scripture, and especially in the Davidical psalms. But a general effluence of the Spirit of holiness on a nation, to produce a change of heart, seems to be first announced by Isaiah. The nearly contemporary prophecy of Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28, 29</a>) is, perhaps, as wide in its scope, but limited to the prophetic gift, which is not necessarily conjoined with spiritual-minded-ness or holiness of life. Isaiah, the "evangelical prophet," first teaches that the conversion of a nation is God's work, effected by the Holy Spirit, and effectual to the entire change of the heart of a people. <span class="cmt_word">And the wilderness be a fruitful</span> <span class="cmt_word">field</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the community long cursed with barrenness of good works" (ver. 10) "becomes once more fruitful of them." <span class="cmt_word">And the fruitful field be counted for a forest</span>. An order of climax seems to be here intended. The <span class="accented">midbar</span>, the bare pasturage-ground, becomes a Carmel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> carefully cultivated; the Carmel becomes like Lebanon, a rich and luxurious forest. There is no close parallel between this verse and ver. 17 of <a href="../../par/isaiah/29.htm">Isaiah 29</a>. The prophet is not tied down by his previous metaphors.

Peace - a true peace, not a false one (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>) - shall be the result of the reign of righteousness. War, quarrels, enmity, hostile feelings, are all of them the fruit of unrighteousness. In the kingdom of the Messiah, just so far forth as it is thoroughly established, "the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace" (<a href="../../par/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The effect of righteousness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the service of</span> righteousness, which perhaps means here "the wages of righteousness." <span class="cmt_word">Quietness and assurance</span>; or, <span class="accented">quietness and confidence</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>). The final happiness of the blessed in Christ's kingdom is always spoken of as a state of "rest and quietness" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-16.htm">Jeremiah 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-11</a>, etc.).

"The forest" has commonly been regarded as Assyria, on the strength of <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>.

A spiritual meaning doubtless underlies the literal sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 33"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/33.htm"><title>Isaiah 33 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/33.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/33.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/33-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/32.htm" title="Isaiah 32">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 33 <a href="../isaiah/34.htm" title="Isaiah 34">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a></div><div class="verse">Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou <i>wast</i> not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; <i>and</i> when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - THE JUDGMENT ON ASSYRIA AND DELIVERANCE OF JERUSALEM, STATED GENERALLY. Events had progressed since the preceding prophecies were delivered. The negotiations carried on with Sennacherib had been futile (ver. 7), the heavy fine imposed and paid (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>) had been of no avail (ver. 18); the Assyrian monarch was still dissatisfied, and threatened a second siege. Already he was upon his march, spoiling and ravaging (ver. 1). The people of the country districts had removed into the town (ver. 8) - in a little time the vast host might be expected to appear before the walls. All was terror, grief, and confusion. Under these circumstances, Isaiah is once more commissioned to declare the approaching discomfiture of the mighty conqueror, and deliverance of Jerusalem out of his hand (vers. 3, 4). The deliverance ushers in a reign of righteousness (Vers. 5, 6). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to thee that spoilest</span>. The "spoiler" is here, evidently, Assyria - the world-power of this entire group of prophecies (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>), and the greatest "spoiler" of Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou wast not spoiled</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "that hast not yet been spoiled thyself." A covert threat is conveyed in the words. <span class="cmt_word">And dealest treacherously</span>; rather, <span class="accented">usest violence</span> (compare the comment on Isaiah 21:2). <span class="cmt_word">When thou shalt cease to spoil</span>, etc. Conquering nations cannot with safety pause on their career. Their aggressions have roused so many enmities that, let them cease to attack, and at once they are attacked in their turn. Every man's baud is against the spoiler whose hand has been against every man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-2.htm">Isaiah 33:2</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord</span>, etc. The mingling of prayer with prophecy is very unusual, and indicative of highly excited feeling. Isaiah realizes fully the danger of his people and nation, and knows that without prayer there is no deliverance. His prayer is at once an outpouring of his own heart, and an example to others. <span class="cmt_word">We have waited for thee</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their Am</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the Arm of thy people." <span class="cmt_word">Every morning</span>. Continually, day by day, since their need of thy support is continual.

The "noise" is that caused by God "lifting up himself" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3-9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a></div><div class="verse">And your spoil shall be gathered <i>like</i> the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Your spoil shall be gathered</span>. The "spoiling" of Assyria would commence with the discomfiture of the great host. In the historical narrative (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>) nothing is said of it; but, beyond a doubt, when the host was to a largo extent destroyed, and the remainder fled, there must have been an enormous booty left behind, which the enemies of the Assyrians would naturally seize. A further spoiling of the fugitives probably followed; and, the <span class="accented">prestige</span> of the great king being gone, marauding bands would probably on all sides ravage the Assyrian territory. <span class="cmt_word">Like the gathering of the caterpillar</span>. The "caterpillar" (<span class="accented">khasil</span>) is probably the grub out of which the locust develops - a very destructive insect. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he run</span>. It would be better to render, <span class="accented">shall they</span> run. The word, indeed, is in the singular; but it is used distributively, of the various spoilers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-5.htm">Isaiah 33:5</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is exalted</span>. His destruction of the Assyrian host is an exaltation of God; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it causes him to be exalted in the thoughts of those who have cognizance of the fact (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3-10</a>, etc.). It is an indication to them that he has his dwelling on high, and is the true King of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">He hath filled Zion with judgment</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15-17</a>). The destruction is, in part, the result, in part the cause, of the Jews once more turning to God, putting away their iniquities, and establishing the reign of justice and righteousness in the land (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a></div><div class="verse">And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, <i>and</i> strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD <i>is</i> his treasure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and the stability of thy times shall be</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> consist in) <span class="accented">a rich store of salvations</span>, <span class="accented">wisdom</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge</span>. The prophet here addresses the people of Judah in the second person, though in the next clause he reverts to the third. Such transitions are common in ancient compositions, and especially characterize the writings of Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">The fear of the Lord is his treasure</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wisdom intended is that which is based upon "the fear of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>). This will be at once Judah's "treasure," and a guarantee of stability to her government and institutions (compare the Homiletics on Isaiah 32:15-17). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-12.</span>  -  THE PROPHET ENTERS FURTHER INTO PARTICULARS. Having "sketched the main outlines of his revelation," Isaiah proceeds to "fill in and apply the details" (Cheyne). He first describes the despair and low condition of Judah: the men of war wailing aloud; the ambassadors just returned kern Laehish weeping at the ill success of their embassy; all travelling stopped; the land wasted and made a desert; the Assyrians still ravaging and destroying, despite the peace which had been made (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>). Then suddenly he sees Jehovah rousing himself (ver. 10), and the Assyrians con-stoned, as if with a fire (vers. 11, 12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without</span>. "Their lion-hearts "(Cheyne); "heroes" (Delitzsch). Literally, <span class="accented">lions of God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1</a>). They raise a cry of mourning in the streets, with child-like effusiveness (comp. Herod., 8:99; 9:24). <span class="cmt_word">The ambassadors of peace</span>. Hezekiah probably sent several embassies to Sennacherib in the course of the war. One went to Lachish, offering submission, in  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>); another to Nineveh, with tribute and presents, in the same or the following year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; comp. 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135). A third probably sought to deprecate Sennacherib's auger, when he made his second invasion (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>) in  <span class="date">B.C. 699</span> (?). These last would seem to be the "ambassadors" of this verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a></div><div class="verse">The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The highways lie waste</span> {croup. <a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>). The meaning is that' they were unoccupied. Fear of the Assyrians restrained men from travelling. <span class="cmt_word">He hath broken the covenant</span>. Sennacherib, when he accepted the sum of money sent him by Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; 'Eponym Canon,' p. 135), must have consented to leave him unmolested for the future. But in a very short time we find him, apparently without any reasonable pretext, sending a fresh expedition against Jerusalem, requiring it to be admitted within the walls, and even threatening the city with destruction (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13</a>). Isaiah, therefore, taxes him with having broken his covenant. <span class="cmt_word">Despised cities</span>. "Sennacherib," says Delitzsch, "continued to storm the fortified places of Judah, in violation of his agreement." <span class="cmt_word">Regardeth no man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pays no attention to the protests that are made against his infraction of the treaty - does not care what is said or thought of him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a></div><div class="verse">The earth mourneth <i>and</i> languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed <i>and</i> hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off <i>their fruits</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The earth mourneth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the land</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Lebanon is... hewn down</span>; rather,  as in the margin, <span class="accented">is withered away</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>). Lebanon, Sharon, Carmel, and Bashan are the four most beautiful regions of the Holy Land, taking the word in its widest extent. Lebanon is the northern mountain-range, one hundred and twenty miles in length, clad with cedars and firs, and generally crowned with snow, whence the name (from <span class="accented">laban</span>, white). Sharon is "the broad rich tract of land" which stretches southwards from the foot of Carmel, and melts into the Shefelah, noted for its flowers (<a href="../../par/songs/2-1.htm">Song of Solomon 2:1</a>) and forests (Josephus, '<span class="accented">Ant</span>. Jud.,' 14:13, &sect; 3). Carmel is the upland dividing Sharon from the Esdraelon plain, famous for its "<span class="accented">rocky</span> dells" and "deep jungles of copse." Finally, Bashan is the trans-Jordanic upland, stretching from the flanks of Hermon to Gilead, celebrated for its "high downs" and "wide-sweeping plains," for its "forests of oak," and in ancient times for its herds of wild cattle. All are said to be "waste," "withered," and the like, partly on account of the Assyrian ravages, but perhaps still more as sympathizing with the Jewish nation in their distress - "ashamed" for them, and clad in mourning on their account. <span class="cmt_word">Shake off their fruits;</span> rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">shake down their leaves</span>. Mr. Cheyne conjectures that the prophecy was delivered in autumn.

The prophet's first thought <span class="accented">is</span>, how wonderfully the overthrow has manifested the might of God (ver. 13). Next, how it must thrill with fear the hearts of the wicked among his people (ver. 14). Thirdly, how the righteous are by it placed in security, and can look back with joy to their escape, and can with confidence look forward to a future of happiness and tranquil lily (vers. 15-24). Messianic ideas intermingle with these latter thoughts (vers. 17, 23), the image of a happy, tranquil Judah melting into that of Messiah's glorious kingdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye that are far off</span>, etc. Jehovah speaks by the mouth of his prophet, and calls on the nations of the earth, far and near, to consider and acknowledge his might, as shown in his judgment on <span class="accented">Assyria</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>).

The Edomites first showed themselves enemies of Israel when they refused to allow the Israelites, under Moses, "a passage through their border" (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). David subdued them (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>:14); but they revolted from Jehoram (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-8.htm">2 Chronicles 21:8-10</a>), and were thenceforward among the most bitter adversaries of the southern kingdom. They "smote Judah" in the reign of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>), and were always ready to "shed the blood of the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>). Amos speaks of them very much in the same tone as Isaiah (<a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11, 12</a>). They ultimately "filled up the measure of their iniquities" by open rejoicing when  Jerusalem was destroyed, and the people led away captive by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10-13</a>).

It lay in the hilly country to the south-cast of the Dead Sea, about thirty-five miles north of Petra, and was one of the earliest settlements of the descendants of Esau, being mentioned as a well-known place in Genesis 34:33). The threats here uttered against it are repeated by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-13.htm">Jeremiah 49:13</a>), who says that "Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; all the cities thereof [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the dependent cities] shall be perpetual wastes." Bozrah is probably identified with the modern <span class="accented">El-Busaireh</span>, a village of about fifty houses, occupying a site in the position above indicated, amid ruins which seem to be those of a considerable city (Burckhardt, 'Syria,' p. 407; Robinson, 'Researches in Palestine,' vol. 2. pp. 570, 571).

In all three places the "day" of God's vengeance is contrasted with the "year" of his recompense, to show how infinite is his mercy, how short-lived, comparatively speaking, his auger. Mr. Cheyne well compares the concluding clauses of the second commandment, where "retribution is declared to descend to the third and fourth generation, but mercy to the thousandth." <span class="cmt_word">Recompenses for the controversy of Zion</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for the vindication of Zion</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the maintenance of her right in the quarrel between her and her enemies.

Though Edom has no perennial rivers, it has numerous torrent-courses to carry off the winter rains (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-20.htm">2 Kings 3:20-22</a>). These should run with pitch, instead of water. The general idea is that Edom should be visited with a destruction like that of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>). But the prophet scarcely intends his words to be taken literally; he is making Edom a type or representation of God's enemies, and the gist of his teaching is that a dreadful vengeance, an utter destruction, will come upon all who set themselves up against the Most High. In the next verse he declares that the vengeance will be eternal (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/34-10.htm">Isaiah 34:10</a></div><div class="verse">It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">None shall pass through it forever and ever</span>. There was a literal fulfillment of the prophecies against Edom to a considerable extent. Malachi, writing three hundred years after Isaiah, says that the "mountains and the heritage of Esau <span class="accented">were laid waste</span> for the dragons of the wilderness" (<a href="../../par/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a>); and he makes the Edomites themselves exclaim, "We are <span class="accented">impoverished</span>, but we will return and build the <span class="accented">desolate</span> places" (Malachi 1:4). A certain amount of recovery must have followed; and in the Maccabee period Edom appears once more as an adversary of Israel, and an adversary of some importance (1 Macc. 5:3, 65). Gradually, however, she had to yield to the superior power of Judaea, and was even ruled by viceroys, whom the Maccabee princes nominated. One of these, Antipater, was the father of Herod the Great. From his time Idumea languished until, in the seventh century after Christ, it was overrun and conquered by the Mohammedan Arabs, who completed its ruin. It is now, and has been for above a thousand years, one of the most desolate tracts upon the earth's surface.

The Hebrew word translated "cormorant," is now generally regarded as designating the "pelican," while the one rendered "bittern" is thought by some to mean "hedgehog"  or "porcupine." Animals that delight in solitude are certainly meant, but the particular species is, more or less, matter of conjecture. <span class="cmt_word">He shall stretch out upon it</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and one shall stretch</span> out <span class="accented">upon it</span>.

The destruction of cities was effected by rule and measure, probably because different portions of the <span class="accented">task</span> were assigned to different sets of laborers, and, if the work was to be completely done, it required to be done systematically. Here, the measuring-tape and the plumb-line are to be these of <span class="accented">tohu</span> and <span class="accented">vohu</span>, or of the eternal chaos out of which God, by his word, produced order (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>).

The word is probably a derivative from <span class="accented">leilah</span>, night, and designates" the spirit of the night" - a mischievous being, who took advantage of the darkness to play fantastic tricks. A Jewish legend made Lilith the first wife of Adam, and said that, having pronounced the Divine Name as a charm, she was changed into a devil. It was her special delight to murder young children (Buxtorf, 'Lex. Rabbin.,' <span class="accented">ad roe</span>.). The prophets, when they employ poetic imagery, are not tied down to fact, but are free to use the beliefs of their contemporaries in order to heighten the force of their descriptions.

By "the book of the Lord" some understand a collected volume of Moses and the prophets, psalmists, etc., previous to Isaiah's time, which they suppose to have existed in his day. But there is no evidence of any such collection. It is better to understand the expression of Isaiah's own prophecies, or of such a collection of them as he had made previously to the composition of the present chapter. Nothing contained in the entire book should, he says, fail of its accomplishment. Even the minutiae of the present chapter should, each and all, have their fulfillment, though not, perhaps, in every case a literal one. <span class="cmt_word">My mouth... his Spirit</span>. The "mouth" of the prophet and the "Spirit" of God, which dictates to him what he is to write, are in accord; and the Spirit will bring to pass what the mouth inspired by him has "commanded."

On the punishment of God's enemies will follow the peace, prosperity, and glory of his Church. Previously, the Church is in affliction, waste, and desolate. Its enemies once removed, destroyed, swept out of the way, it rises instantly in all its beauty to a condition which words are poor to paint. The highest resources of the poetic art are called in to give some idea of the glory and happiness of the final Church of the redeemed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them</span>; rather, the <span class="accented">wilderness</span>, <span class="accented">and the dry place</span>, <span class="accented">shall be glad</span>.

In the Church of the redeemed there will be "weak" brethren as well as strong, "feeble" as well as healthful (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12-14</a>). God, by the mouth of his prophet, calls on the strong to impart of their strength to their weaker brethren, uplifting their "weak hands," as Aaron and Hur did those of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-12.htm">Exodus 17:12</a>), and "confirming" or sustaining their "feeble knees." So St. Paul: "We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves" (<a href="../../par/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4</a></div><div class="verse">Say to them <i>that are</i> of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come <i>with</i> vengeance, <i>even</i> God <i>with</i> a recompence; he will come and save you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say to them that are of a fearful heart</span>.

There is One alone who can save, and he must do it <span class="accented">himself</span>, and, to do it, he must "come" to us. The words were at once an announcement of the Incarnation, and a promise to every trembling, doubting heart - a promise of <span class="accented">direct</span> Divine assistance, of the presence of God within us, of help potent to save. The predominant thought of the prophet appears to have been Messianic, and hence the burst of glorious prophecy which follows  - a burst of prophecy most inadequately expounded of the time of the return from the Captivity.

In the literal sense, our Lord claims these prophecies to himself and his earthly career, when he says to the disciples of John the Baptist, "Go and show John those things which ye do hear and see, the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear" (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4, 5</a>); but they have doubtless a further spiritual sense, in which they belong to the whole period of his mediatorial kingdom, and are correlative to former utterances of the prophet, in which the blinded eyes and deaf ears and stammering tongues of God's people had been spoken of and made the subject of complaint (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>, etc.). Our Lord's miracles of bodily healing, performed during the three years of his earthly ministry, were types and foreshadowings of those far more precious miracles of spiritual healing, which the great Physician is ever performing on the sick and infirm of his Church, by opening the eyes of their understandings, and unstopping the deaf ears of their hearts, and loosening the strings of their tongues to hymn his praise, and stirring their paralyzed spiritual natures to active exertions in his service. Doubtless Isaiah, or the Spirit which guided him, intended to point to both these classes of miracles, and not to one of them only, as characteristic of the Messiah's kingdom.

The 'bridge of the gatherer" is, however, in the other world, not in this world; but Isaiah's "highway" is here.

There is an irreconcilable difference between this note of time, in the passage as it stands, and the Assyrian inscriptions. The fourteenth year of Hezekiah was  <span class="date">B.C. 714</span> or 713. Sargon was then King of Assyria, and continued king till  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>. Sennacherib did not ascend the throne till that year, and he did not lead an expedition into Palestine till  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>. Thus the date, as it stands, is cloven or twelve years too early. It is now the common opinion of critics that the chronology of the Books of Kings, speaking generally, is "a later addition to the Hebrew narrative" (Cheyne, 'Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 199, note 1). It is uncertain when the dates were added; but it would not be long from the time when the addition was made before "<span class="accented">Isaiah"</span> would be brought into accord with "Kings." Another view is that the date belongs to the original writings, but that it has suffered corruption, "fourteenth" having been substituted for "twenty-sixth," from  an overstrict rendering of the expression, "in those days," which introduces the narrative of ch. 38. That narrative undoubtedly belongs to Hezekiah's fourteenth year. A third view is that of Dr. Hincks, who suggests a derangement of the text, which has attached to an expedition of Sennacherib a date originally belonging to an attack by Sargon. He supposes the original text to have run thus: "And it came to pass in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah that the King of Assyria came up (against him). In those days was King Hezekiah sick unto death, etc. (ch. 38, 39.). And Sennacherib, King of Assyria, came up against all the defenced cities of Judah, and took them," etc. (ch. 36, 37.). The subject has been treated at considerable length by Mr. Cheyne ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. pp. 196-204), who has accidentally ascribed to Sir H. Rawlinson the second of the above theories, which really originated with the present writer. <span class="cmt_word">Sennacherib, King of Assyria</span>. The Hebrew rendering of the name is <span class="accented">Sankherib</span>, the Greek <span class="accented">Sanacharibus</span> or <span class="accented">Senacheribus.</span> In the Assyrian the literation is <span class="accented">Sin-akhi-irib -</span> and the meaning" Sin (the moon-god) multiplies brothers." Sin-akhi-irib was the son and successor of Sargon. His father was murdered, and he ascended the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span> (G. Smith, 'Epunym Canon,' p. 67). <span class="cmt_word">Came up against all the defenced cities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the fenced cities</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>,or "all the <span class="accented">fortified</span> cities" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">And took them</span>. Sennacberib tells us that, in the campaign of his fourth year ( <span class="date">B.C. 701</span>), he "captured forty-six of the strong cities" belonging to Hezekiah, King of Judah, while of the "fortresses and small cities" he took "a countless number" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134). (On the causes of the war and its general course, see the Introduction to the book.)

It is inconceivable that, immediately after the grant of terms of peace and their acceptance, Sennacherib should have renewed the war; there must have been an interval, and a fresh provocation. The interval can have been only a short one, since Hezekiah died in  <span class="date">B.C. 697</span>. It may have been a couple of years, or perhaps no more than a year, or possibly only a few months. The fresh provocation probably consisted in an application for aid, made by Hezekiah to Tir-hakah, or to the subordinate Egyptian kings, which is glanced at in ver. 6. The Assyrian annals, which never record any reverse or defeat, are wholly silent as to this second expedition. The only profane confirmation of it is to be found in Herodotus (2:141). <span class="cmt_word">From Lackish</span>. Laehish, an ancient city of the Amorites (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>), was assigned by Joshua to the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), and seems to have been still a Jewish possession (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>). It occupied "a low round swell or knoll" in the Shefelch, or low tract between the Judaean highland and the Mediterranean, and lay near, if not directly on, the direct route which armies commonly followed in their march from Syria into Egypt. The site is now known as <span class="accented">Um-Lakis</span>; it lies between Gaza and <span class="accented">Ajlan</span> (Eglon), about two miles west of the hitter.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-3.htm">Isaiah 36:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eliakim: Hilkiah's son</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-20.htm">Isaiah 22:20</a>). Eliakim had now taken the place of the Shebna who was "over the house" when Isaiah prophesied his downfall (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>) and Eliakim's advancement (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-21.htm">Isaiah 22:21-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shebna the scribe</span>. It is not quite certain that this is the same "Shebna" as the former prefect of the palace, but the uncommonness of the name is a strong argument for the identity. The post of "scribe" or "secretary "(marginal rendering) was one of some importance (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>), though inferior to that of palace prefect. <span class="cmt_word">Joah... the recorder</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>, where the same three officials are mentioned in the same order). We learn from Kings that Sennacherib sent in reality three envoys (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>) to Hezekiah - the Tartan, or "commander-in-chief;" the Rabsaris, or "chief eunuch;" and the Rabshakeh, or "rab-sak," the "chief captain," the second in command after the tartan. Hezekiah thought it right to appoint an equal number of officials to meet and confer with them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-4.htm">Isaiah 36:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence <i>is</i> this wherein thou trustest?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Rabshakeh said.</span> Of the three Assyrian envoys Rabshakeh alone obtains mention in Isaiah, probably because he was the spokesman (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19, 26, 27, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-4.htm">2 Kings 19:4</a>).

"The great king" (<span class="accented">sarru rabbu</span>) is the most common title assumed by the Assyrian monarchs in their inscriptions.

In <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20</a> we read, "Thou sayest" for "I say," which gives a better sense. Dr. Kay holds the two forms to be "complementary." <span class="cmt_word">I have counsel and strength for war</span>. Either the words of Hezekiah had been reported to Sennacherib, or he rightly divined Hezekiah's thoughts. It was, no doubt, in reliance on the "counsel" of Eliakim and the "strength" of Egypt that the Jewish monarch had a second time provoked his suzerain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a></div><div class="verse">Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so <i>is</i> Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This broken reed</span>; rather, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="accented">this bruised reed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-3.htm">Isaiah 42:3</a>).

There had been times when Egypt was a strong power, feared and respected by her neighbours, and a terror even to Assyria. But these times were long past. For the last fifty years the country had been divided against itself (see the comment on Isaiah 19:2), split up into a number of petty principalities, Recently the neighbouring kingdom of Ethiopia had claimed and exercised a species of sovereignty over the entire Nile valley, while allowing tributary princes to govern different portions of it. Of these princes the most important at the time of Rabshakeh's embassy seems to have been Shabatok, who reigned in Memphis, probably from  <span class="date">B.C. 712</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 698</span>. Egypt is likened to a "bruised reed" on account of her untrustworthincss. "So" (Sabaco) had given no substantial help to Hashes. Shabatok was little likely to imperil himself in order to assist Hezekiah. Even Tirhakah would probably avoid, as long as he could, a conflict with the full power of Assyria. Pharaoh, King of Egypt. Sennacherib uses the generic term, "Pharaoh," instead of mentioning any of the petty princes by name, because he means to speak generally. The King of Egypt, under present circumstances, whoever he may be, is no better than a bruised reed. In his own inscriptions, Sennacherib about this time uses the expression, "the kings of Egypt" ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 1.47). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-7.htm">Isaiah 36:7</a></div><div class="verse">But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: <i>is it</i> not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou say to me, We trust in the Lord</span>. "The Assyrians," it has been observed, "had a good intelligence department" (Cheyne). It was known to Sennacherib that Hezekiah had a confident trust, which seemed to him wholly irrational, in Jehovah - the special God of his people. It was also known to him that Hezekiah, in the earlier portion of his reign (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>), had "removed the high places" and broken down the altars, where Jehovah had for centuries been worshipped throughout the length and breadth of the land. He concludes that, in so doing, he must have offended Jehovah. He is probably ignorant of the peculiar proviso of the Jewish Law, that sacrifice should be offered in one place only, and conceives that Hezekiah has been actuated by some narrow motive, and has acted in the interests of one city only, not of the whole people. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall worship before this altar</span>. The parallel passage of 2 Kings (2 Kings 18:22) has "this altar <span class="accented">in Jerusalem."</span> The brazen altar in the great court of the temple is, of course, meant. Hezekiah had cleansed it front the pollutions of the time of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>), and had insisted on sacrifice being offered nowhere else (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-21.htm">2 Chronicles 29:21-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-15.htm">2 Chronicles 30:15-24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>, etc.). Such a concentration of worship was unknown to any of the heathen nations, and may well have been unintelligible to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore give pledges</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "bind yourselves under s-me penalty." Rabshakeh here interrupts his message' to introduce an offer of his own. Intent on ridiculing the absurdity of Hezekiah's resistance of Assyria, he promises to make him a present of two thousand horses, if he (Hezekiah) can find two thousand trained riders to mount them. It is quite likely that he was safe in making this promise, and that, notwithstanding the abundant use of chariots and horses by the Jews of the time for purposes of luxury (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>), they were destitute of a cavalry force and unaccustomed to the management of war-horses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a></div><div class="verse">How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How then wilt thou turn away the face</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "How wilt thou be able to defeat, and <span class="accented">cause to retreat</span>, a single Assyrian captain at the head of his squadron?" <span class="cmt_word">And put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but thou trustest in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen.</span> Consciousness of the weakness, with which Rabshakeh had just reproached them, had led to their application to Egypt for a chariot and a cavalry force. Egypt was well able to furnish both, and had sent a large force of both to the help of Ekron a short time previously ('Eponym Canon,' p. 133, 11. 48-56). That force had, however, suffered defeat at the hands of Sennacherib. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-10.htm">Isaiah 36:10</a></div><div class="verse">And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Jehovah said unto me</span>, <span class="accented">Go up</span>, etc. (camp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>, where Necho tells Josiah that "God commanded" his expedition against Carchemish). The heathen monarchs frequently represented themselves as directed to make war on a nation by God, or by some particular god. Piankhi Mer-amman says, "I am born of the loins. created from the egg, of the Deity...  I have not acted without his knowing; he ordained that I should act" ('Records of  the Past,' vol. 2. p. 91). Mesha, King of Moab, declares, "Chemosh said to me, Go and take Nebo [in war] against Israel" (ibid., vol. 11. p. 166). Asshur is generally represented as commanding the expeditions of the Assyrian kings (ibid., vol. 1. pp. 21, 48, 60, etc.). Still, it is surprising that Sennacherib should mention "Jehovah" as the God from whom he had received the order to attack Hezekiah, and we may suspect that the term which he actually employed was <span class="accented">Ilu</span>, "God," and that either Rahshakeh, or the reporter of the speech, substituted "Jehovah" as more intelligible to the Jews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand <i>it</i>: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people that <i>are</i> on the wall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak...  unto thy servants in the Syrian language</span>; literally, in <span class="accented">the Aramaic language.</span> Aramaeans were widely spread over the entire region between the Lower Tigris and the Mediterranean; and their language seems to have been in general use, as a language of commerce. "Private contract tablets in Aramaic and <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> have been found in the remains of ancient Nineveh" (Cheyne). Rabshakeh had, perhaps, spoken "in the Jews' language " without any ill intent, thinking that it was the only tongue which Jewish envoys would understand; but his so doing was calculated to affect the minds of the common people, and to shake their allegiance to Hezekiah. The envoys, therefore, requested him to employ a foreign tongue, and suggested Aramaic as one which was familiar to them, and which they supposed that he would understand. His employment of Hebrew had shown them that he was a linguist. <span class="cmt_word">In the Jews' language</span>. There was no language peculiar to the Jews as Jews, that is to say, different from the ordinary speech of the Israelites. Both alike spoke Hebrew. In the Old Testament, however, this corn-men language is never called "Hebrew," but either "the tongue of Canaan" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19:18</a>) or "the Jewish language" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-18.htm">2 Chronicles 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-24.htm">Nehemiah 13:24</a>).

There is nothing improbable in Rabshakeh's having thus spoken. Isaiah had long been encouraging Hezekiah to resist Sennacherib by promises of Divine aid (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-31.htm">Isaiah 30:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4-9</a>). Hezekiah would naturally repeat these premises to the people, and could not give their effect in simpler words than by saying, "Jehovah will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the King of Assyria." Spies and deserters would naturally tell the Assyrian envoys what he had said.

They would be safe front the terrible extremities hinted at in ver. 12, and might confidently await the great king's ultimate disposal of them, which would be determined widen the war in these parts was over.

It was so much thee usual policy of Assyria to remove to a new locality a conquered people, which had given them trouble, that Rabshakeh felt safe in assuming that the fate in store for the Jews, if they submitted themselves, was a transplantation. Sargon had transported the Israelites to Gozan and Media (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>), the Tibarcni to Assyria, the Commageni to Susiana ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 423). Sennacherib himself had transported into Assyria more than two hundred thousand Aramaeans (ibid., p. 430). It might be confidently predicted that, if he conquered them, he would transplant the Jews. Rabshakeh tries to soften down the hardship of the lot before them by promises of a removal to a land equal in all respects to Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">To a land like your own land</span>. This was certainly not a general principle of Assyrian administration. Nations were removed from the far north to the extreme south, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>, from arid to marshy tracts, from fertile regions to comparative deserts. The security of the empire, not the gratification of the transported slaves, was the ruling and guiding principle of all such changes. A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. The writer of Kings adds, "a land of oil olive and of honey." (On the productiveness of Palestine, see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-27.htm">Numbers 13:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-7.htm">Numbers 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-23.htm">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-11.htm">Deuteronomy 11:11, 12</a>.)

Sennacherib claims to be entitled to the people's allegiance, and represents Hezekiah as a rebel, who seeks to draw them away from their duty. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land? The successes of the Assyrians, and the religious character of their wars, justified this boast. The pervading idea of the inscriptions is that wars arc undertaken for the glory of the Assyrian deities, particularly of Asshur, for the chastisement of his enemies, and with the object of establishing in each country, as it is brought under subjection, the laws and worship of Asshur (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 322-324 and 531). The nations fight under the protection of their own gods, and thus each war is a struggle between the Assyrian deities and those of the nation with which they arc contending. Hitherto, undoubtedly, Assyria had met with almost uniform success (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/36-19.htm">Isaiah 36:19</a></div><div class="verse">Where <i>are</i> the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where <i>are</i> the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where are the gods of Hamath?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>). Sargon had reduced Hamath in his third year,  <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>. He had "swept the whole land of Hamath to its extreme limit," taken the king prisoner, and carried him away captive to Assyria, where he flayed and burned him; removed most of the inhabitants, and replaced them by Assyrians; plundered the city of its chief treasures, and placed an Assyrian governor over it (see 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 126-128). Among the treasures taken were, no doubt, the images of the Hamathite gods, which were uniformly carried off by the Assyrians from a conquered city. <span class="cmt_word">And Arphad</span>. Arphad, or Arpad (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>), had joined with Hamath in the war against Assyria, and was taken by Sargon in the same year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 127). Of Sepharvaim. Scpharvaim, or Sippara, was besieged and captured by Sargon in his twelfth year,  <span class="date">B.C. 710</span>. A severe example was made of the inhabitants (G. Smith, 'History of Babylonia,' p. 122). A discovery made by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam, in 1881, is thought to prove that Sippara was situated at Abu-Habbah, between Baghdad and the site of Babylon, about sixteen miles from the former city (see the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 8. pp. 164, 173). "Hena" and "Ivah," joined with Sepharvaim by the author of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-31.htm">2 Kings 18:31</a>), seem to be omitted by Isaiah as unimportant. They are thought to have been towns upon the Euphrates, not very distant from Babylon, and have been identified respectively with Anah and Hit. But the identification is in both cases uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">Have they delivered Samaria?</span> Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne translate, "<span class="accented">How</span> <span class="accented">much less</span> have they delivered Samaria?" Kay, "<span class="accented">Verily have they</span> delivered," regarding the sentence as ironical. Sennacherib can see no distinction between the cities where Jehovah was worshipped, and those which acknowledged any other tutelary god. As Samaria fell, why should not Jerusalem fall?

Hezekiah can scarcely have anticipated that Rabshakeh would so far depart from ordinary usage as to make a speech to "the men on the wall." But he may have been in the immediate neighbourhood, and, when apprised of the envoy's proceedings, may have sent the order. We are not to suppose that the Jewish king was at a loss for an answer.

This last supposition is wholly gratuitous, since we have no indication, either in Scripture or in the inscriptions, of any such insurrection. The choice lies between the other two, or between one or other of them, and the two combined. The vagueness is owing, not to the time at which the present narrative took shape, but to the fact that a vague promise - quite sufficient for its purpose - was given at first, the filling in of the details being reserved for a later period (see vers. 22-35). <span class="cmt_word">I will cause him to fall by the sword</span> (see ver. 38).

Sennacherib's object in moving upon Libnah is doubtful; but it would seem, from his monuments, that he had captured Lachish (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152), and had gone on to Libnah, as the next stronghold on the way to Egypt.

His movement rather provoked than alarmed Sennacherib, who, having defeated one Egyptian army in  <span class="date">B.C. 701</span> ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 133, 134), was confident of success against another. <span class="cmt_word">He sent messengers</span>. It is not very clear what advantage Sennacherib expected from this second embassy. He had no fresh argument to bring forward, unless it were a suggestion that Hezekiah's God was endeavouring to deceive him. In the main, vers. 10-13 are a mere expansion of <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee</span>. Sennacherib recognized Jehovah as a god, the God of the Jews, but put him on a par with the other "gods of the nations" (ver. 11), and (lid not believe in his being able to contend with Asshur. If he were really, through his priests or prophets, giving Hezekiah assurances of protection and deliverance, he could only be "deceiving" him.

"Telassar," "the Hill of <span class="accented">Asshur</span>," is not mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions, but was probably the Assyrian name of a town on or near the Euphrates, in the country of the Bent-Eden, which was not far from Carche-mish (see 'Records of the Past,' ch. 3. pp. 90-92). <span class="cmt_word">The children of Eden</span>.

Compare the exhibition of the Books of the Law, painted with idolatrous emblems, at Maspha, "over against" the temple, by Judas Maccabaeus and his companions (1 Macc. 3:46-48). The act in both cases implied the referring of the whole matter to God for his consideration. It was, as Delitzsch, says, a sort of "prayer without words."

It has been <span class="accented">questioned</span> whether Hezekiah was really as pronounced a monotheist as these expressions would imply, and suggested that  his actual words received "a colouring" from a later writer. Hezekiah's contemporaries, it is said, Isaiah and Micah, make no such strong statements of their belief in one only God as this (Kuenen, Cheyne). But it is difficult to see what can be a clearer revelation of monotheism than <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>, or what truth more absolutely underlies the whole of Isaiah's teaching than the unity of the Supreme Being.

Sennacherib's belief, that each country has its own god (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-18.htm">Isaiah 36:18-20</a>), is not shared by the religious Jews of his time.

This was a stubborn fact, which it was impossible to deny. From the time of Asshur-izir-pal at any rate, about  <span class="date">B.C. 880</span>, Assyria had pursued for nearly two centuries a steady career of conquest, reducing the nations which were her neighbors, almost without exception, and gradually spreading her power from the tract immediately about Nineveh to the Persian Gulf on the south, the great plateau of Iran on the east, the Armenian Mountains (Niphates and Taurus) on the north, and on the west to Cilicia and the Mediterranean. Her progress towards the west alone is marked in Scripture, since there alone she came in contact with God's people. Under Pul (about  <span class="date">B.C. 760</span>) she attacked Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>); under Tiglath-Pileser II. she carried off a portion of the ten tribes (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>); under the same monarch she subjugated Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>); under Shalmaneser she besieged (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>), and under Sargon took, Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>); under Sargon also she invaded Philistia and captured Ashdod (ch. 20:1). Now she was bent on subduing Judaea, and so preparing the way for the reduction of Egypt. Humanly speaking, it was most unlikely that the small and weak state of Judaea would be able to resist her. But God was all-powerful, and might be pleased to cast down, as he had been pleased to exalt (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-19</a>). Hence Hezekiah's appeal.

Confident in Jehovah, her Protector, she despises him, and laughs him to scorn; nay, "shakes her head at him," or rather. "after him," pursuing him with scornful gestures as In. retreats before her.

And hast said. Sennacherib had not actually uttered these words with his mouth; but the prophet clothes in his own highly poetic language the thoughts which the Assyrian king had cherished in his heart. He had regarded "the multitude of his chariots" as irresistible; he had considered that the mountains which guarded Palestine would be no obstacle to his advance; he had contemplated ravaging and despoiling of its timber the entire country; he had meant to penetrate into every region that was lovely and fertile. The emphatic "I" of the original <span class="accented">- ani -</span> twice repeated, marks the proud egotism of the monarch. <span class="cmt_word">By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the multitude</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">with chariots upon chariots.</span> The Assyrian kings contrived to cross with their chariots mountain chains of great difficulty, and frequently boast of the achievement. Tiglath-Pileser I. says, "I assembled my chariots and warriors. I betook myself to carts of iron in order to overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the wilderness thus practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. pp. 9, 10). Asshur-izir-pal, "The rugged hill country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and armies, with instruments of iron I cut through, and with metal rollers I beat down the chariots and troops I brought over" (ibid., vol. 3. p. 58). Shalmaneser II., "Trackless paths, difficult mountains, which like the point of an iron sword stood pointed to the sky, on wheels of iron and bronze I penetrated. My chariots and armies I transported over them" (ibid., p. 85). In the less rough parts, while the warders dismounted, tire horses drew the chariots, which were assisted over obstacles by attendants ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 74); but, in regions of greater difficulty, they were conveyed across the mountain ranges in waggons of rude and strong construction ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 13) The chariot-force was regarded as so important that the Assyrians never made any distant expedition without it. <span class="cmt_word">To the sides of Lebanon</span>. It was not necessary to cross either Libanus or Anti-Libanus in order to invade Judaea, <span class="accented">since</span> the natural route was along the Coele-Syrian valley and across the spurs of Hermon to the Jordan; but an Assyrian army was intent on plunder and devastation, no less than upon conquest, and would ascend mountain regions that did not lie on its direct line of march for either or both of these objects. It was customary for the soldiers to cut clown the tall cedars and choice fir trees of Lebanon on their Syrian campaigns, in order to transport the timber to Nineveh and other great cities, where it was used for building (see the comment on Isaiah 14:8, and compare Layard, 'Nineveh and <span class="accented">Babylon</span>,' pp. 356, 357, and 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 47, 83, 90; vol. 5. p. 119; vol. 9. p. 16, etc.). It was also customary to destroy the trees in an enemy's country, simply in order to inflict injury upon the foe ('Ancient Monarchies.' vol. 2. p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">I will enter into the height of his border</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will enter into its uttermost height</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will penetrate through the entire mountain region of Palestine, called roughly "Lebanon," to the furthest height of any importance - that on which Jerusalem stood - and thus occupy the whole land. The parallel passage of 2 Kings has "lodging" for "height," in apparent allusion to the palace of Hezekiah. And the forest of his Carmel; or, <span class="accented">the forest of its pleasure-garden</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the rich plantation tracts, covered with vines, olives, and fig trees, which formed the special glory of Judaea (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-16.htm">Isaiah 36:16, 17</a>).

Sennacherib notes three natural obstacles to his advance - the forces of his opponents he does not appear to account an obstacle - viz. mountains, deserts, rivers. Mountains do not stop him - he crosses them even with his chariot-force (ver. 24). Deserts do not stop him - he digs wells there, and drinks their waters. Rivers will not stop him - he will dry them up, trample them into puddles. Note the contrast between the past tenses, "I have come up," "I have digged," "I have drunk," and the future, "I will dry up." He had crossed the mountain ranges Sinjar, Amanus, Lebanon; he had passed waterless tracts, where he had had to dig wells, in Mesopotamia and Northern Syria. He was about to find his chief obstacle, rivers, when he invaded Lower Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">The rivers of the besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the rivers of Egypt. Mazor</span>, the singular form (compare Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and modern Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span>), is used here (as in <a href="../../par/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>, and perhaps in <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>), instead of the ordinary dual term, <span class="accented">Miz-raim</span>, probably because Lower Egypt is especially intended. Sennacherib was looking especially to the invasion of Lower Egypt,where the Nile had "seven branches" (Herod., 2:17), and the country was also cut up by numerous canals, which would naturally constitute a great difficulty to a force depending mainly on its chariots. He  believed, however, in his heart, that he would find a way of "drying up" these "rivers." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-26.htm">Isaiah 37:26</a></div><div class="verse">Hast thou not heard long ago, <i>how</i> I have done it; <i>and</i> of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities <i>into</i> ruinous heaps.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou not heard, etc.?</span> An abrupt transition, such as is common in Isaiah. From speaking in the person of Sennacherib, the prophet without warning breaks off, and returns to speaking in the person of Jehovah, as his mouthpiece. "Hast thou not heard," he says, long ago; or rather, "<span class="accented">that from</span> long ago! have done this?" Art thou so ignorant, so devoid of that light of nature, which should "lighten every man that cometh into the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>), as not to know God's method of governing the world? How that "from long ago," in his eternal counsels, he designs the rise and fall of nations, and the mode in which their destruction is to be brought about? Art thou not aware that conquerors are mere instruments in God's hands - "the rods of his anger" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>) - to work his will, and then to have his will worked upon them in turn (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6-19</a>)? Sennacherib seems to be really reproached for not knowing what he ought to have known, and might have known, if he had listened to the voice of conscience and reason. <span class="cmt_word">Now have brought it to pass</span>, etc. All that Sennacherib had done, he had done as God's instrument, by his permission - nay, by his aid. He had been the axe in the hand of the hewer (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>), the saw, the rod, the staff, of God's indignation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), the executor of his vengeance. The very purpose of his being was that he should "lay waste (certain) defenced cities into ruinous heaps." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-27.htm">Isaiah 37:27</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore their inhabitants <i>were</i> of small power, they were dismayed and confounded: they were <i>as</i> the grass of the field, and <i>as</i> the green herb, <i>as</i> the grass on the housetops, and <i>as corn</i> blasted before it be grown up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. The original is not so emphatic, but still contains the idea, not merely of sequence, but of consequence. God, having decreed the successes of the Assyrians, effected them (in part) by infusing weakness into the nations that were their adversaries. <span class="cmt_word">They were as the grass of the field</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6, 7</a>). The comparison is one constantly used by the Hebrew psalmists (<a href="../../par/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90-5.htm">Psalm 90:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-7.htm">Psalm 92:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15</a>), and was not unknown to the Assyrians ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 14). The delicate grass of spring in the East withers within a few weeks, and the fresh and tender herbage becomes yellow, parched, and sapless. The grass that springs upon the earthen roofs of houses fails even more rapidly (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/129-6.htm">Psalm 129:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As corn blasted before it be grown up</span>; literally, <span class="accented">like a field before the stalk.</span> Our translators seem to have rightly preferred the reading of <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-26.htm">2 Kings 19:26</a> (<span class="accented">sh'dephah</span>, equivalent to "blasting") to that of Isaiah (<span class="accented">sh'demah</span>, equivalent to "field") in this place. Their rendering brings out the true sense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-28.htm">Isaiah 37:28</a></div><div class="verse">But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know thy abode</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy down-sitting</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>). The meaning is that God has, and has had, his eye on Sennacherib throughout all his career, seeing to and watching over his performance of his will. The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">going out, and coming in</span>, is a Hebrew idiom for a man's doings (see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Thy rage against me</span>. As shown in the message sent by Rab-shakeh (ch. 36:7), in Rabshakeh's speech to the "men on the wall" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-15.htm">Isaiah 36:15-20</a>), and in the letter sent to Hezekiah from Lachish (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-10.htm">Isaiah 37:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a></div><div class="verse">Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I put my hook in thy nose</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). The Assyrians were in the habit of passing "hooks" or "rings" through the noses or lips of their more distinguished prisoners, and attaching a thong to the hook or ring, by which they led the prisoners into the royal presence ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 304; vol. 3. p. 436). The expressions used derive their force from these practices, but are not in the present place to be understood literally. God "turned Sennacherib back" and reconducted him to Nineveh. not with an actual "hook" or "thong," but by the "bridle" of necessity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>shall be</i> a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat <i>this</i> year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This shall be a sign unto thee</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the sign.</span> The prophet now turns to Hezekiah, and makes an address to him. "This," he says, "shall be the sign unto thee of Sennachcrib's being effectually 'bridled,' and the danger from Assyria over. In the third year from the present the land shall have returned to its normal condition, and you shall enjoy its fruits as formerly. Meanwhile you shall obtain sufficient nourishment from the grain which has sown itself." The "third year," according to Hebrew reckoning, might be little more than one year from the date of the delivery of the prophecy. The entire withdrawal of all the Assyrian garrisons from the country, which no doubt followed on Sennacherib's retreat, might well have occupied the greater part of a year. Till they were withdrawn, the Jews could not venture to till their territory. <span class="cmt_word">Plant vineyards</span>. The Assyrians had, no doubt, cut down the vines (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 40, 62, 79; vol. 7. p. 43, etc.; Layard, 'Monuments of Nineveh,' second series, pl. 40). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a></div><div class="verse">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The remnant that is escaped</span> (see the comment on ver. 4). Take root downward, and bear fruit upward; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "spread over the land, and became firmly rooted in it, and flourish as in the former time." We must conceive of the Assyrians having, in their two recent invasions, completely depopulated the country districts. Numbers had, no doubt, been slain; more than two hundred thousand had been carried into captivity; a portion had found refuge in the capital On the withdrawal of the Assyrians,  these last "went forth," reoccupied their lands, and rebuilt their towns and villages. The blessing of God was upon them, and in a short time Judaea recovered her ancient vigour, so that, under Josiah, she was able to extend her dominion over almost the whole of the old Israelite territory (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6, 18</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a></div><div class="verse">For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The zeal</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>). The phrase is very emphatic, marking the greatness of the thing to be done, and at the same time bringing the strophe to an end with an asseveration beyond which nothing could go. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>, etc. A new clause is commenced - the concluding clause of the prophecy. For Hezekiah's satisfaction and consolation something more definite is needed than the vague assurances that "the daughter of Jerusalem shook her head at Sennacherib" (ver. 22), and that God would "put a bridle in Sennacherib's mouth" (ver. 29). Accordingly, it is now declared, in the plainest terms, that he shall not even lay siege to the city, but shall return by the way by which he came - the coast route - leaving Jerusalem untouched, nay, unattempted. <span class="cmt_word">He shall not come into this city</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the city.</span> He was at Libnah, in the Shefeleh, thirty or forty miles from Jerusalem, when we last heard of him (ver. 8); and, having then been just informed of the advance of Tirhakah, he is likely to have proceeded on towards Egypt. There is, at any rate, not the slightest intimation of his having made a retrograde movement towards the Jewish capital. <span class="cmt_word">Nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it</span>. The main points of an Assyrian siege are happily seized. The first assailants were the archers. They boldly approached in large bodies, and strove to clear the battlements of the defenders. Then shields were brought into play. Under their cover the archers drew nearer; the scaling parties brought up their ladders; the miners attacked the foundations of the walls; and the torch-bearers endeavoured to fire the gates. Finally, if these tactics did not avail, banks were raised against the walls, which were then assailed with battering-rams till they were breached and the assailants could cuter. God promises that Jerusalem shall experience none of these things at Sennacherib's hands. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-34.htm">Isaiah 37:34</a></div><div class="verse">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By the way that he came</span>. It is clear that Sennacherib on this occasion had marched by the usual coast route, through Sharon and the Shefeleh, upon Lachish, leaving Jerusalem far to his left. From Laehish he sent Rabshakeh to Hezekiah with a threatening message, and (as our version has it) "<span class="accented">with</span> a great army;" rather, "with a strong force." Rabshakeh, having delivered his message, returned to his master (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-8.htm">Isaiah 37:8</a>), doubtless with his escort. Sennacherib then sent a letter by messengers, but without an army, so far as we are told, to renew his threats. Meanwhile from Lachish he went to Libnah, after which we know nothing of his movements, unless we accept the Egyptian account, which was, that he advanced to Pelusium. The declaration, "By the way that he came, by the same shall he return" (comp. ver. 29) was the most comforting that Hezekiah could possibly receive. It assured him that he would not even be confronted with his enemy. Into this city; rather, <span class="accented">unto this city</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> in ver. 32). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-35.htm">Isaiah 37:35</a></div><div class="verse">For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will defend this city...  for mine own sake</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will cover over this city</span>, as a bird covers its young with its wings (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-5.htm">Isaiah 31:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). God would do this "for his own sake;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because his own honour was concerned in the defence of his people. He would also do it for his servant David's sake; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the promises made to David, that his children should sit upon his throne (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29-37</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11-14</a>, etc.), which involved the continued independence of Judaea and Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a></div><div class="verse">Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they <i>were</i> all dead corpses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the angel of the Lord went forth</span>. The parallel passage of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) has, "It came to pass <span class="accented">that night</span>, that the angel of the Lord went out." The word of Isaiah had its accomplishment within a few hours. On the camp of the Assyrians, wherever it was, whether at Libnah, or at Pelusium (Herod., 2:141), or between the two, in the dead of night, the destroying angel swooped down, and silently, without disturbance, took the lives of a hundred and eighty-five thousand' men. The camp was no doubt that in which Sennacherib commanded. It is contrary to the whole tenor of the Assyrian inscriptions to imagine that a mere <span class="accented">corps d'armee</span>, detached to threaten, not to besiege, Jerusalem, could have been one-half, or one-quarter, so numerous. It was Sennacherib's host, not the Tartan's, that was visited. So the Egyptian tradition; so ver. 37, by implication. That in later times the Jews should have transferred the scene of the slaughter to the vicinity of their own capital, as Josephus does ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:2. &sect; 5), is not surprising, especially as the Egyptians claimed the glory of the discomfiture for their own gods, and the completion of the victory for their own soldiers. The nature of the destruction is not, perhaps, very important, if it be allowed to have been supernatural; but the "simoom" of Prideaux and Milman, the "storm" of Vitringa and Stanley, the "nocturnal attack by Tirhakah" of Usher, Preiss, and Michaelis, and the "pestilence"  of most other commentators, seem to be alike precluded by the terms of the narrative, which imply the silent death in one night of a hundred and eighty-five thousand persons by what English juries call "the visitation of God." The nearest parallel which Holy Scripture offers is the destruction of the firstborn in Egypt; but that was not, as this, without disturbance (see <a href="../../par/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30</a>). There a "great cry" broke the silence of the night; here it was not till morning, when men woke from their peaceful slumbers, that the discovery was made that "they were all dead corpses." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-37.htm">Isaiah 37:37</a></div><div class="verse">So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Sennacherib...   departed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">broke up his camp.</span> The word used for all the removals of the children of Israel in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-3.htm">Numbers 33:3-48</a>). The loss of even an entire <span class="accented">corps d'armeee</span> would not have caused an Assyrian king, at the head of an intact main army, to break up his camp and abandon his enterprise. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt at Nineveh</span>. Sennacherib lived some eighteen or twenty years from the probable date of his discomfiture, dying in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. His ordinary residence was at Nineveh, which he greatly adorned and beautified ('Records of the Past,' vol. 11. pp. 55-57). His father, Sargon, on the contrary, dwelt commonly at Khorsabad (Dur-Sargina), and his son, Esarhaddon, dwelt, during the latter part of his reign, at Babylon. We must not suppose, however, that Sennacherib was shut up in Nineveh during the remainder of his life. On the contrary, he made frequent expeditions towards the south, the east, and the north. But he made no farther expedition to the south-west, no further attack on Jerusalem, or attempt on Egypt. The Jews had peace, so far as the Assyrians were concerned, from the event related in ver. 36 to a late date in the reign of Esarhaddon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nisroch his god</span>. The name Nisroch has not been found in the Assyrian inscriptions, and is, in fact, read only in this place and the parallel passage of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>). It has been supposed to represent Nusku, an Assyrian god of a somewhat low position, who, however, does not obtain mention in the historical inscriptions until the time of Asshur-bani-pal. Probably the name has suffered corruption. Asshur was, in fact, Sennacherib's favourite deity, and it is remarkable that the LXX. give in this place, not Nisroch, but <span class="accented">Asarach.</span> "Asarach" would seem to be "Asshur" with a guttural suffix. <span class="cmt_word">Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him.</span> The murder of Sennacherib by a son, whom he called "Ardumazanes," was related by Polyhistor (ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:5, &sect; l). Esar-haddon's annals are imperfect at the commencement, but show that his authority was at first contested, and that he had to establish it by force of arms ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. pp. 103, 104). Adrammelech seems to have assumed the title of king (Abyden. up. Euscb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1:9, &sect; 1), and to have been put to death by his brother. Sharezer is not elsewhere mentioned. The name is Assyrian, as far as it goes, but is incomplete. Its full form was probably Nabu-sar-uzur or Nergal-sar-uzur (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 63,  <span class="date">B.C. 682</span> and 678). And escaped into the land of Armenia. So Moses of Chorene ('Hist. Armen.,' 1:22). The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">Ararat</span> (Assyrian <span class="accented">Urardu</span> or <span class="accented">Urartu</span>), which was the more eastern portion of Armenia, and lay beyond the sphere of Assyrian influence. Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. Esarhaddon (Asshur-akh iddiua) appears to have ascended the throne in  <span class="date">B.C. 681</span>. It is highly improbable that Isaiah was then living, and therefore the verse can scarcely be from his pen. It has probably been transferred from 2 Kings (2 Kings 19:37) in order to finish off the narrative. Esarhaddon outlived Hezekiah many years, and was brought into contact with Manasseh ('Eponym Canon,' p. 139), whom he reckoned among his tributaries (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/36.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 36"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 36" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/38.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 38"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 38" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/38.htm"><title>Isaiah 38 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/38.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/38.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/38-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/37.htm" title="Isaiah 37">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 38 <a href="../isaiah/39.htm" title="Isaiah 39">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-1.htm">Isaiah 38:1</a></div><div class="verse">In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.

Prophecies were often threats, and, when such, were conditional, announcing results which would follow unless averted by prayer or repentance (compare Jonah's prophecy, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown," <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>).

The action resembles that of Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but the spirit is wholly different. Ahab turned away in sullenness, Hezekiah that he might pray undisturbed Beds seem to have been placed in the corners of rooms, with the head against one wall of the room, and one side against another.

Hezekiah was in the full vigour of life - thirty-nine years old only. He had probably as yet no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him, was but twelve (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-1.htm">2 Kings 21:1</a>, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-1.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1</a>) when Hezekiah died at the age of fifty-four. It was a grievous thing to a Jew to leave no male offspring: it was viewed as a mark of the Divine displeasure to be cut off in the midst of one's days (<a href="../../par/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15, 16</a>: <a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>). Hezekiah asked himself - Had he deserved such a sentence? He thought that he had not. He knew that, with whatever shortcomings, he had endeavoured to serve God, had trusted in him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>), cleaved to him (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>), "departed not from following him, but kept his commandments" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-6.htm">2 Kings 18:6</a>) He therefore ventured upon an expostulation and an earnest prayer; and God was pleased to hear the prayer and to grant it. <span class="cmt_word">I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart</span>. Compare the unbiased testimony of the authors of Kings and Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-2.htm">2 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-20.htm">2 Chronicles 31:20, 21</a>). Under the old dispensation, there was nothing to prevent men from pleading their righteousness before God (comp. <a href="../../par/job/31-4.htm">Job 31:4-40</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/7-3.htm">Psalm 7:3</a>-2; 18:20-24; 26:1-8, etc.). Hezekiah, however, does not really regard himself as sinless (comp. ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah wept sore</span>. In the East feelings are but little restrained. Joy shows itself in laughter and shouting, grief in tears and shrill cries. Xerxes wept when he thought of the shortness of human life (Herod., 7:46); the Persians rent the air with load cries at the funeral of Masistius (ibid., 9:24); on the news of the defeat at Salamis all Susa "cried aloud, and wept  and wailed without stint" (ibid., 8:99). So David wept for Jonathan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>) and again for Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-1.htm">2 Samuel 19:1</a>); Joash wept when he heard the words of the Law (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-19.htm">2 Kings 22:19</a>); Nehemiah wept at the desolation of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>); the ambassadors of Hezekiah, when disappointed of the object of their embassy, "wept bitterly" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-7.htm">Isaiah 33:7</a>). No king in the East puts himself under any restraint, if he has an inclination for either tears or laughter.

The author of Kings describes graphically how Isaiah, after delivering his message, had gone out, but had not reached the middle court of the palace, when his footsteps were arrested, and the Divine voice bade him "turn again and relieve Hezekiah's fears by a fresh announcement" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>). So swiftly does God answer "the prayer of faith."

This was doubling, or rather more than doubling, the length of Hezekiah's reign, and allowing him a length of life exceeding that of the great majority of the kings of Judah, who seldom attained the age of fifty.

It was the day of the free offering of "signs" by God to those whom his providence had placed at the head of his people. Ahaz had been offered a sign (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>), but had refused the offer made him (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-12.htm">Isaiah 7:12</a>); the Lord had then "himself" given him a sign." Hezekiah received a sign to assure him of the complete discomfiture of Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-30.htm">Isaiah 37:30</a>); an offer was here made him of a sign of a peculiar kind, and it was offered under peculiar conditions. We learn from 2 Kings that a choice was submitted to him  - he was to determine whether time, as measured by a certain timepiece or clock, which was known as "the dial of Ahaz," should make a sudden leap forward - the shadow advancing ten degrees upon the dial (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-9.htm">2 Kings 20:9</a>), or whether it should retire backwards, the shadow upon the same dial receding ten degrees. Hezekiah determined in favour of the latter <span class="accented">sign</span>, from its appearing to him the more difficult of accomplishment; and on his declaring his decision, the shadow receded to the prescribed distance. Time was rolled backward, or at any rate appeared to be rolled backward; and the king, seeing so great a miracle, accepted without hesitation the further predictions that had been made to him. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken</span>. By the <span class="accented">nexus</span> of this verse with the preceding, it would naturally be concluded that "the thing" to be done was the defence of Jerusalem; but ver. 22, which belongs properly to this part of the narrative, shows the contrary. Hezekiah had asked for a sign" that he should go up to the house of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun-dial of Ahaz</span>. We are informed by Herodotus that the sun-dial was an invention of the Babylonians (Herod., 2:109), from whom it would readily pass to the Assyrians. Ahaz may have obtained a knowledge of it, or an actual specimen, when he visited Tiglath-Pileser at Damascus (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>), and, on his return to his capital, have caused one to be erected there. Sun-dials are of several kinds. The one here spoken of seems to have consisted of a set of steps, with a perpendicular gnomon or pole at the top, the shadow of which receded up the steps as the sun rose in the heavens, and descended down them as the sun declined. We must suppose that the sign was given in the forenoon, when the shadow was gradually creeping up the steps. Hezekiah thought that a sudden jump in the same direction would be as nothing compared with a reversal of the motion, and therefore required that the shadow should go back, which it did. How the effect was produced, whether by an eclipse as argued by Mr. Bosanquet ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeology,' vol. 3. pp. 34-40), or by refraction, or by an actual alteration of the earth's motion, we are not told; but there is reason to believe that the cause, whatever it was, was local, not general, since the King of Babylon subsequently sent ambassadors, to inquire concerning "<span class="accented">the wonder</span> <span class="accented">that was done in the land"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sun returned ten degrees</span>. We must not press this expression as indicating a real alteration of the <span class="accented">sun's</span> place in the heavens. The meaning is that <span class="accented">the shadow cast by the sun re</span>turned.

Manifestly, though he believes in a future state, it is one in which there is either no energy at all, or at any rate no devotional energy. He may think, with Isaiah. that "the righteous man," when he is "taken away," will "enter into peace" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1, 2</a>); but absolute "peace" precludes energy (see Arist., 'Eth. Nit.,' 1. 10. &sect; 2). Hezekiah shrinks from losing all his activities, including his sense of personal communion with God. He does not, perhaps, "look on the condition of the faithful departed as one of <span class="accented">comfortless gloom</span>;" but he views it as one of deprivation, and is unwilling to enter into it. It was by the coming of Christ and the preaching of his gospel that "life and immortality" were first truly "brought to light" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>).

The embassy probably followed the illness of Hezekiah within a year. <span class="cmt_word">Merodach-Baladan</span>. This is a more correct form than the "Berodach-Baladan" of <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-12.htm">2 Kings 20:12</a>. The name is one common to several Babylonian kings, as to one who reigned about  <span class="date">B.C. 1325</span>, to a second who is placed about  <span class="date">B.C. 900</span>, and to a third who was contemporary with the Assyrian kings Sargon and Sennacherib. It is this last of whom we have a notice in the present passage. He appears first in the Assyrian inscriptions as a petty prince, ruling a small tract upon the seacoast, about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates. Tiglath-Pileser takes tribute front him about  <span class="date">B.C. 744</span>. In  <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> we find him advanced to a more prominent position. Taking advantage of the troubles of the time, he shakes off the Assyrians yoke, and makes himself King of Babylon, where he has a reign of twelve years - from  <span class="date">B.C. 721</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span>. This reign is recognized by Sargon in his inscriptions ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and by the Greek chronologist, Ptolemy, in his 'Canon.' In  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> Sargon leads an expedition against him, and drives him out of Babylonia into the coast-tract, Chaldea, where he besieges him in his ancestral town Bit-Yakin, takes the city, and makes him prisoner (ibid., p. 15). On the death of Sargon, in  <span class="date">B.C. 705</span>, Merodach-Baladan escapes from confinement, and hastens once more to Babylon, where he is acknowledged as king, and has a second reign, which lasts six months (Alex. Polyhist. ap. Euseb., 'Chronicles Can.,' 1. 5. &sect; 1). He is then driven from the country by Sennacherib, and, after various vicissitudes, obliged to become a refugee in Elam (G. Smith, 'Hist. of Babylonia,' pp. 125-128). The name of Merodach-Baladau is composed of the three elements, <span class="accented">Merodach</span> (equivalent to "Mar-duk"), the god, <span class="accented">bal</span> or <span class="accented">pal</span>, "son," and <span class="accented">iddina</span>, "has given," and thus signifies "Merodach  has given (me) a son." <span class="cmt_word">The son of Baladan</span>. "Baladan" is scarcely a possible Babylonian name. "Beladan" would, however, be quite possible, being a name formed on the model of Ishtardddin ('Eponym Canon,' p. 30), Ninip-iddin (p. 35), Ilu-iddin (p. 57), etc. And the corruption of Beladan into Baladan would be easy. Merodach-Baladan III. is called by Sargon "the son of Yakin;" but this is perhaps a tribal or local rather than a personal name. Compare Jehu's appellation of "son of Omri" (ibid., p. 114). <span class="cmt_word">Sent letters and a present to Hezekiah</span>. Hezekiah's fourteenth year was  <span class="date">B.C. 714</span>. Merodach-Baladan had then been King of Babylon for eight years, and, knowing that he might at any time be attacked by Sargon, was naturally looking out for alliances with other powers, which Assyria equally threatened. He had recently concluded a treaty with Khumbanigas, King of Elam ('Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 14), and had obtained the support of several of the Aramaean tribes on the Euphrates. He now apparently thought that Judaea, which Sargon was also threatening (ch. 38:6), might be induced to join him. Hezekiah's illness and "the wonder done in the land" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>) furnished him with pretexts for an embassy, which probably had more serious objects than either congratulation or scientific inquiry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah was glad of them</span>. A more pregnant phrase than that which replaces it in 2 Kings, "hearkened unto them." Hezekiah, like Merodach-Baladan, was looking out for allies, and "was glad," thinking that in Babylon he had found one which might render him important service. Sargon's promptness, however, frustrated his hopes. In  <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> that prince, regarding Merodach-Baladan's proceedings as constituting a real danger to his kingdom, made a great expedition into Babylonia, defeated Merodach-Baladan, and took him prisoner, after which he had himself crowned King of Babylon, and during the remainder of his life ( <span class="date">B.C. 709</span> to 705) ruled both countries. <span class="cmt_word">Showed them the house of his precious things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his treasury, or store-house. The treasuries of ancient monarchs were actual <span class="accented">store-chambers</span>, in which large quantities of the precious metals and valuable objects of various kinds were deposited (see Herod., 2:121; Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:16, 18, etc.). The flourishing state of the treasury is an indication that the events here narrated are anterior to the great surrender of treasure to Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15</a>; 'Epenym Canon,' p. 135). <span class="cmt_word">All the house of his armour</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). If a warlike alliance was contemplated, it was as important to show the possession of arms as of treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah showed them not. We must allow for Oriental hyperbole. The meaning is, that, without any reserve, Hezekiah showed all that he could show. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-3.htm">Isaiah 39:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, <i>even</i> from Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came Isaiah the prophet</span>. Isaiah comes, unsent for, to rebuke the king (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-5.htm">2 Chronicles 12:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2, 3</a>, etc.). This bold attitude was one which prophets were entitled to take by virtue of their office, which called upon them to bear testimony, even before kings, and to have no respect of persons. A similar fearlessness is apparent in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-17</a>, where the king with whom Isaiah has to deal was the wicked Ahaz. <span class="cmt_word">What said these men?</span> "These men" is contemptuous. The demand to know what they said is almost without parallel. Diplomacy, if it is to be successful, must be secret; and Isaiah can scarcely have been surprised that his searching question received no answer. But he was zealous of God's honour, and anxious that Hezekiah should rely on no "arm of flesh," whether it were Egypt or Babylon. Such dependence would straiten God's arm, and prevent him from giving the aid that he was otherwise prepared to give. The desire of the prophet is to warn the king of the danger which he runs by coquetting with human helpers. <span class="cmt_word">From whence came they?</span> Isaiah does not ask this question for the sake of information, Doubtless all Jerusalem was agog to see the strange envoys "from a far country," who had now for the first time penetrated to the city of David. All knew whence they had come, and suspected why. Isaiah asks, to force the king to a confession, on which he may base a prophecy and a warning. <span class="cmt_word">And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country.</span> Embassies from distant lands to their courts are made a con-slant subject of boasting by the Assyrian monarchs (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 28, 68, 95; vol. 7. pp. 49, 51, etc.). Hezekiah, perhaps, is "lifted up" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-25.htm">2 Chronicles 32:25</a>) by the honour paid him, and intends to impress Isaiah with a sense of his greatness <span class="accented">-</span> "The men are come all the way from Babylon to see <span class="accented">me</span>!" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-4.htm">Isaiah 39:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he, What have they seen in thine house?

Hezekiah tells him the truth, since he is not ashamed of his act, but rather glories in it. He has shown the ambassadors everything, and has thereby made them eager to secure his alliance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-5.htm">Isaiah 39:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear the word of the Lord of hosts</span>. Either the prophet had been specially charged with a Divine message to  the king before he sought his presence, or the prophetic afflatus now came on him suddenly. The former is, on the whole, more probable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, that all that <i>is</i> in thine house, and <i>that</i> which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the days</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">coming</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">approaching.</span> Of the exact "times and seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), the prophets generally knew nothing. They were mouth-pieces, to declare the Divine will, not keen-witted politicians, forecasting results by the exercise of sharp-sightedness and sagacity. To suppose that Isaiah foresaw by mere human wisdom the Babylonian conquest of Judaea, as Charles the Great did the ravages of the Northmen (R. Williams, 'Hebrew Prophets,' vol. 1. p. 429), is to give him credit for a sagacity quite unexampled and psychologically impossible. The kingdom of Babylon was one among many that were struggling hard to maintain independence against the grasping and encroaching Assyria. From the time of Tiglath-Pileser IX. she had been continually losing ground. Both Sargon and Sennacherib trampled her underfoot, overran her territory, captured her towns, and reduced her under direct Assyrian government. Till Assyria should be swept away, a Babylonian conquest of Palestine was impossible. To suppose it was like supposing a Russian conquest of Holland, while Germany bars the way. Nothing short of the true prophetic afflatus, which is God the Holy Ghost speaking by the mouth of his servants, could have made such an anticipation. And with Isaiah, as Mr. Cheyne says, it is "not a mere presentiment; it is a calm and settled conviction, based on a direct revelation, and confirmed by a deep insight into the laws of the Divine government." <span class="cmt_word">All that is in thine house</span>. Not, of course, exactly all that was there when Isaiah spoke, but all the wealth that should be in the royal palace when the time of the Babylonian captivity arrived. (For the fulfilment, see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-18.htm">2 Chronicles 36:18</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">That which thy fathers have laid up in store</span>. A portion of this was carried off by Sennacherib in his first expedition (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>); but the bulk of the temple treasures - the gifts of many kings - remained untouched until they were removed to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-2.htm">Daniel 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-13.htm">2 Kings 25:13-17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a></div><div class="verse">And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of thy sons that shall issue from thee</span>. Hezekiah had at the time, probably, no son, since Manasseh, who succeeded him upon the throne, was not born till two years later. Besides Manasseh, he appears to have had a son, Amariah, who was an ancestor of the Prophet Zephaniah (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-1.htm">Zephaniah 1:1</a>). He may, of course, have also had others. His descendants, rather than his actual sons, seem to be here intended; and the fulfilment of the prophecy is to be found in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>, where certain "of the king's seed" are mentioned among the Israelites who served as eunuchs in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/39-8.htm">Isaiah 39:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good <i>is</i> the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth in my days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Good is the word.</span> While there is resignation, there is no doubt something also of selfishness, in Hezekiah's acceptance of the situation. "Apres mot le deluge" is a saying attributed to a modern Frenchman. Hezekiah's egotism is less pronounced and less cynical. He thinks with gratitude of the "peace and steadfastness" which are to be "in his day;" he does not dwell in thought on the coming "deluge." The "word of the Lord" is "good" to him in more ways than one. It has assured him of coming male offspring - of sons to sit upon his throne, and save him from the curse of childlessness. And it has assured him of a rest for his nation - a respite, so that the Babylonian struggle shall not follow immediately upon the Assyrian; but there shall be a "breathing-space" (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-8.htm">Ezra 9:8</a>), a tranquil time, during which Israel may "dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-18.htm">Isaiah 32:18</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/38.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 38"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 38" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/40.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 40"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 40" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/3.htm"><title>Isaiah 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/2.htm" title="Isaiah 2">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 3 <a href="../isaiah/4.htm" title="Isaiah 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON JERUSALEM. The general denunciations against Israel of the two preceding chapters are here turned especially against Jerusalem. God will deprive her of all her superior and more honorable classes (vers. 1-3); and will give her "children" for her rulers (ver. 4).

The "stay" and "staff" intended are certainly not, literal "bread" and "water," but the powerful and respectable classes enumerated in the two following verses. If the words are Isaiah's, he must have intended them to be taken metaphorically.

The mention of the fact that the men of Jerusalem have permanently injured their moral natures by sin, and thus "rewarded evil to themselves," leads the prophet to declare at this point, parenthetically, the general law, which extends alike to the evil and the good - that men receive in themselves the recompense of their deeds. The righteous raise their moral nature, become better, and, in becoming better, become happier. "It is well with them, for of the fruit of their doings they eat."

The Egyptian remains show an advanced state of luxury among the women at a time anterior to Moses; and in Assyria, though the evidence is less abundant, we find also indications of a similar kind. The Jews, whose regard for their women was high, are not likely to have been behindhand in the gallantry which shows itself in heaping ornament and the newest appliances of civilization on the weaker sex.

Anklets were worn by the Egyptian women from the time of the twelfth dynasty (about  <span class="date">B.C. 1900</span>). They were, in general, plain rings of metal, but appear to have been sometimes set with precious stones (see Lepsius, 'Denkmaler,' pt. 2. pls. 128, 129). No bells appear attached to any; but bells were known in Assyria from the time of Sennacherib ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 417, 2nd edit.).

Mr. Cheyne prefers "wreaths worn round the forehead, reaching from one ear to the other." <span class="cmt_word">Round tires like the moon; rather, crescents</span>. Flat ornaments in metal, like a young moon, generally worn suspended round the neck (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, where the same word occurs).

Earrings were worn from very ancient times by both the Assyrians and the Egyptians. The ring had frequently a pendant hanging from it. Men wore armlets in Assyria, and both men and women in Egypt (Lepsius, 'Denktamer,' pt. 3. pl. 1). Veils have always been regarded in the East as almost a necessary part of female attire.

It is quite uncertain what this was, since we have no representations of Hebrew women. Egyptian women commonly wore a mere fillet with pendant ends. The Hebrew word here employed is used in Exodus of the head-dress of the priests (Exodus 39:28). The ornaments of the legs. These are explained as chains connecting the two anklets together.

Scent-bottles and jars for holding sweet-smelling unguents are among the most frequent toilette articles recovered from Egyptian tombs and Assyrian palaces. Amulets have been worn in the East from very ancient times, and are still trusted in as much as ever. They frequently take the form of ornaments.

An inner and an outer tunic or petticoat were commonly worn by females of the higher class in the East. The inner tunic was a simple linen vest; but the outer was generally of a better material, and richly ornamented. Outside this, a sort of wrap, or cloak, was worn occasionally (see <a href="../../par/ruth/3-15.htm">Ruth 3:15</a>). Purses were, no doubt, carried by wealthy persons of both sexes; but their mention in this list does not seem very appropriate. Perhaps toilet-bags of some kind or other are intended (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-23.htm">2 Kings 5:23</a>).

In ancient times these were not made of glass, but of some metal which took a high polish. Most commonly, the material seems to have been bronze. Many such mirrors have been found in Egypt, a few in Assyria, in Etruria a considerable number. They are of small size, intended to be carried in the hand, and have for that purpose a metal or a wooden handle, which is sometimes highly artistic. <span class="cmt_word">The fine linen</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the muslin robes</span>. <span class="accented">Sedin</span>, the Hebrew word used, is probably a corruption or analogue of <span class="accented">sin-</span>don, the Greek name for Indian fabrics.

The other word, here translated "vail," occurs only in this place and <a href="../../par/songs/5-7.htm">Song of Solomon 5:7</a>. Its exact meaning is uncertain; but it can scarcely be a veil; since "veils" have been already mentioned (ver. 19).

By "well-set hair" seems to be meant "hair arranged with such exactness and order as to look like a work of art." The exact arrangement of the hair is very remarkable, both in the Egyptian and the Assyrian sculptures. Instead of such elaborate attempts to improve their looks, the daughters of Jerusalem would soon pluck their hair out by the roots, or shave it off, in mourning. <span class="cmt_word">A girding of sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>, etc.; and for the adoption of the custom by women, see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-10.htm">2 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Burning instead of beauty</span>.

Isaiah, however, sees all as already accomplished in the Divine counsels, and so announces it to the people. Israel's warfare, her long term of hard service (comp. <a href="../../par/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a>), will assuredly come to an end; she will thoroughly turn to God, and then her iniquity will be pardoned, she will be considered to have suffered enough.

Heathen legislators adopted the same rule for certain offences (Arist, 'Eth. Nic.,' 3:5, &sect; 8). It is not here intended to assert that the law of Divine judgment is to exact double; but only to assure Israel that, having been amply punished, she need fear no further vengeance (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-7.htm">Isaiah 61:7</a>).

For God to come down on earth, for his glory to be revealed in any signal way, by the restoration of a nation, or the revelation of himself in Christ, or the final establishment of his kingdom, the "way" must be first "prepared" for him. The hearts of the disobedient must be turned to the wisdom of the just.

It is fitting that some one should announce the fact to the nation. Isaiah calls on the company of prophets living at the time to do so (ver. 9). They are to take up a commanding position, to speak with a loud voice, and to proclaim the good tidings to Zion, to Jerusalem, and to the cities of Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>).

If captive Israel is to be induced to turn' to God, and so hasten the time of its restoration to his favour and to its own land, it must be by rising to a worthy conception of the nature and attributes of the Almighty. The prophet, therefore, in the remainder of this chapter, paints in glorious language the power and greatness, and at the same time the mercy, of God, contrasting him with man (vers. 15-17, 23, 28-31), with idols (vers. 19, 20), and with the framework of material things (vers. 21, 22, 26), and showing his infinite superiority to each and all. In contrasting him with man, he takes occasion to bring into prominence his goodness and loving-kindness to man, to whom he imparts a portion of his own might and strength (vers. 29-31 ). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath measured the waters?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a> and <a href="../../par/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>). The might of God is especially shown in creation, which Isaiah assumes to be God's  work. How infinitely above man must he be, who arranged in such perfection, "by measure and number and weight" (Wisd. 11:20), the earth, the waters, and the heavens, so proportioning each to each as to produce that admirable order and regularity which the intelligent observer cannot but note in the material universe as among its chief characteristics! <span class="cmt_word">In the hollow of his hand</span>. The anthropomorphism is strong, no doubt, but softened by the preceding mention (in ver. 10) of God's "arm," and by the comparison of God to a shepherd (in ver. 11). Isaiah's exalted notion of God renders him fearless with regard to anthropomorphism<span class="cmt_word">.

The <span class="accented">seah</span> was "the ordinary measure for household purposes." <span class="cmt_word">In scales...  in a balance</span>. The <span class="accented">peles</span>, here translated "scales," is probably the steelyard, while the <span class="accented">mozenaim</span> is "the balance" or "pair of scales" ordinarily used for weighing. God metes out all things with measures, scales, and balances of his own, which are proportioned to his greatness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/40-13.htm">Isaiah 40:13</a></div><div class="verse">Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or <i>being</i> his counseller hath taught him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord?</span> Mr. Cheyne remarks, that "in Isaiah there is a marked tendency to hypostatize the Spirit;" and the remark is undoubtedly a just one (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-16.htm">Isaiah 34:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, etc.). In the present place, perhaps, the introduction of "the Spirit of the Lord" arises out of the remembrance of the part in creation which is assigned to the Spirit in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>. He "moved," or "brooded," upon the face of the waters, and thence began the change, or series of changes, by which order was produced out of confusion. The Spirit of the Lord "directed," or regulated, these changes; but who, Isaiah asks, "directed," or regulated, the Spirit itself? Can it be supposed that he too had a director over him? Isaiah does not seriously doubt on this point, or "leave it an open question." He makes his inquiry by way of a <span class="accented">reductio ad absurdum.</span> Is it not absurd to suppose that he had a director or a counsellor? He does not - here, at any rate - so far "hypostatize the Spirit" as to view him as a Person distinct from the Person of God the Father, working under him, and carrying out his will. <span class="cmt_word">Or being his counsellor hath taught him?</span> "The Lord <span class="accented">by wisdom</span> founded the earth" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>); but he was his own counsellor. He had no adviser external to himself. The wisdom which wrought with him was his own wisdom, an essential part of the Divine essence. The evangelical prophet approaches those mysteries of God's nature which the gospel brought to light, but cannot penetrate them.

"From nature," as Mr. Cheyne says, "we pass to history." If God is so great, so apart and by himself in relation to the material universe, what is he in relation to man? What are nations, compared to him, but "as a drop from a bucket," which drips from it, and is of no account? What are they, but as the small dust of the balance, which lies on it but does not disturb its equilibrium? They are absolutely "as nothing" (ver. 17) - vanity and emptiness, <span class="cmt_word">He taketh up the isles as a very little thing</span>; literally, <span class="accented">he taketh up islands</span>, or perhaps <span class="accented">lands</span> generally.

If God be all that has been said of him in vers. 12-17, must he not be wholly unique and incomparable? Then, out of this, the thought arises of the strange, the poor, the mean "likenesses" of God, which men have in their folly set up in various times and places. It has been said that Israel in captivity did not need to be warned against idolatry, of the inclination to which the Captivity is supposed at once to have cured them (Urwick, 'Servant of Jehovah,' p. 15). But there is no evidence of this. Rather, considering the few that returned, and the many that remained behind (Joseph., 'Ant Jud.,' 11:1), we may conclude that a large number adopted the customs, religion, and general mode of life of their masters.'

Perhaps it is enough to suppose that, placing himself ideally among the captives, Isaiah sees that the Babylonian idolatry will be, or at any rate may be, a snare to them, and provides an antidote against the subtle poison. The special antidote which he employs is ridicule, and the first ground of his ridicule is the <span class="accented">genesis</span> or formation of an image. It is made by man himself, out of known material substances. Either a figure is cast in some inferior metal, and then coated with gold and finished with the graving tool, or a mere block of wood is taken and cut into shape. Can it be supposed that such things are "likenesses" of God, or that he is comparable to them? <span class="cmt_word">Casteth silver chains</span>; as ornaments to be worn by the images, which were often dressed (see Thucyd., 2:13; Baruch 6:9-12).

Cyrus, whether we regard him as King of Persia, or as King of Elam (Susiana), would come from a land lying <span class="accented">east</span> of Babylon. "Righteousness called him to his foot" when God, the Righteous One, made him his minister, and gave him a certain task to perform (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gave the nations before him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">gives</span>, or <span class="accented">will give.</span> (On the rapid conquests of Cyrus, see Herod., 1:75-191; and comp.

That he was God's instrument must be admitted by all who allow that the course of history is determined by a superintending Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Made him rule over kings</span>. Mr. Cheyne translates, "makes him trample upon kings," which seems to give the true sense. It was certainly not the general policy of Cyrus to establish under him a number of subject kings, but rather to rule the conquered countries by means of Persian or Median governors (see Herod., 1:153, 156; 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl.

By "the First, and with the last" - a favourite phrase in these later chapters (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6</a> and Isaiah 48:12) - seems to be meant simply "the Eternal" (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8, 11, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-8.htm">Revelation 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-13.htm">Revelation 22:13</a>).

A general terror seized the nations on the conquest of the Medes by Cyrus. Croesus of Lydia, Nabonidus of Babylon, and Amasis of Egypt, were at once drawn together by the common danger, and made alliance offensive and defensive (Herod., 1:77). The weaker tribes and peoples gave themselves up for lost. Scarcely any resistance seems to have been offered to the Persian arms by the tribes between the Halys and Indus, the Jaxartes and the Indian Ocean. Lydia and Babylon alone made a stout fight; but even these were conquered without very much difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">The ends of the earth...  drew near</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> distant nations held (will hold) consultation together on the danger which threatens them. The league of Lydia, Babylon, and Egypt is the only known instance of such "drawing near" (see the preceding note). Isaiah anticipates marked consultations and exhortations with respect to the idol-gods, in which trust should be put; but perhaps he is scarcely serious in vers. 6, 7. Rather he is indulging his sarcastic humour at the expense of the idols and of those who put their trust in them. (For instances, however, of actual trust in particular idols, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 4. p. 58; Herod., 5:67; 8:64,)

Both as a Persian, and as King of Elam, Cyrus might be considered to come from the east. In fact, however, when he attacked Babylon, he fell upon it mainly from the north. After his conquest of Astyages (Istivegu), he made Ecbatana his capital (Herod., 1:153); and it was from this comparatively northern city that he directed his attack upon Nabonidus. His march lay by way of Arbela ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 7. p. 159) and Sippara  (ibid., p. 165), through the district called Akkad to the Chaldean capital.

Recent discoveries have raised the suspicion that Cyrus was a eyncretist, who was willing to accept the chief god of any nation as identical with his own Ormuzd. But it is to be borne in 'mind that the document which has produced this impression is one issued by the priestly authorities of Babylon in their own language, and may have been quite unknown to the Persian court. Cyrus may have been a better Zoroastrian than he is represented by the priests of Merodach. The Zoroastrian religion was, as Delitzsch observes, "nearest to the Jewish religion of all the systems of heathenism" (see . Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 93-117; and comp.

It looks back to the similar expression of vers. 24 and 29 of the preceding chapter, which draw down the curtain upon the idol-gods, while this "behold" reveals One who is to occupy their place, and to be a worthy object of the worship of mankind, <span class="cmt_word">My Servant</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my true and perfect servant, utterly obedient (<a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>); not, like Israel, my rebellious and faithless servant; not, even, like my prophets, yielding an imperfect  obedience, <span class="cmt_word">Whom I uphold</span>. "As the Father hath life in himself, so <span class="accented">hath he given</span> to the Son to have life in himself" (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>).

The publication of Christianity throughout all the world has abundantly fulfilled this promise or prophecy. The call of the Gentiles had been already declared by Isaiah in his earlier preaching (ch. 2:2; 11:10; 19:22-25; 25:6; 27:13, etc.).

The covenant between God and his people being in Christ, it is quite consistent with Hebrew usage to transfer the term to Christ himself, in whom the covenant was, as it were, embodied. So Christ is called "<span class="accented">our</span> Salvation" and "our <span class="accented">Peace</span>," and again, "our Redemption" and "our Life." This is the ordinary tone of Hebrew poetry, which rejoices in personification and embodiment.

Jehovah is still the speaker. He begins by promising a new revelation (ver. 9). Then, before the revelation is made, he calls upon the nations - especially those in the vicinity of Palestine  - to rejoice at what is about to happen (vers. 10-12). After this he proceeds to make the announcement promised in ver. 9  - an announcement that he is about to deliver his people (ver. 16) and to execute vengeance on their enemies (vers. 13-15 and 17). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the former things are come to pass</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> former prophecies have been fulfilled.

The voluntary restoration of a captive people to their own land by the power to which they were subject, and which could compel their services, was emphatically a "new thing" in the world's history. How unwilling the sovereign power was ordinarily to lose such services may be seen by the narrative in Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5-14</a>.), and again by the account which Herodotus gives (1:73, 74) of the ground of quarrel between Alyattes and Cyaxares. <span class="cmt_word">Before they spring forth</span>; or, <span class="accented">shoot forth.</span> The metaphor is one taken from the vegetable world (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45:8</a>).

The call for a "new song" is based upon the ground that the mercy vouchsafed was a "new" one (see ver. 9).

Its villages were probably collections of tents, which were moved from time to time, since the Beni-Kedar were nomads (ch. 21:16; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-5.htm">Psalm 120:5</a>).

The exhortation to "sing unto the Lord a new song" ends with ver. 12, and now the reason or groundwork for the exhortation has to be declared. God is about to make one of the great manifestations of his power upon the earth - to "<span class="accented">go</span> forth" against his enemies, and destroy and devour, and easily prevail against them - not, however, simply in the way of punishment and vengeance, but with a further merciful object. He will punish Babylon, that he may deliver Israel. He has promised not to forsake his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>). He is now about to give effect to his promise by a "new" and strange deliverance. He "will bring his people by a way that they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not known" (ver. 16). It has been said that "in effect it is the day of judgment which is here described" (Cheyne); but this seems to be only so far true as every manifestation of God's wrath towards his enemies is a foreshadowing of  the great and awful day. The event directly in view is the destruction of the Babylonian power by the irresistible arms of Cyrus. Hence the allusion to idolaters and images in ver. 17. <span class="cmt_word">As a mighty man...  like a man of war</span>. (For similar anthropomorpbisms, see <a href="../../par/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He shall stir up jealousy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own jealousy.

He is jealous for his own honour (<span class="accented">supra</span>, ver. 8), and jealous also for his people's honour and reputation and happiness. Occasionally he allows his jealousy to slumber (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>:30, "The times of this ignorance God winked at"); and this he had now done for some fifty or sixty years, since his people were carried into captivity. But the time of acquiescence has gone by - he is about to waken up his "smouldering jealousy, and stir it, till it burns up into a bright flame" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">He shall cry, yea, roar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">yea</span>, <span class="accented">shout</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> utter his battle-cry with a clear, loud voice.

He has chafed, as it were, under the necessity of inaction, and has with difficulty refrained himself. Now he will refrain no longer. <span class="cmt_word">A travailing woman</span>. A woman in her travail, after long endurance, at last gives free vent to her natural feelings, and utters loud cries (compare the preceding verse). I will destroy and devour at once (so Gesenius, Kay, and the ancient versions). But the bulk of modern commentators render, "I will pant and gasp," as does a travailing woman.

The result of God's "stirring up his jealousy," and giving a free vent to his feelings, will be the destruction of the great and mighty ones of the earth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-14.htm">Isaiah 2:14</a>).

There is, perhaps, some allusion to those dealings with the river-beds, which the Greek historians ascribe to Cyrus (Herod., 1:189, 191; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:5, &sect; 10), and which are not disproved by the fact that the one native account of the capture of Babylon by Cyrus, which has come down to us, makes no mention of them.

By some critics the earlier verses of this passage (vers. 19-21) are regarded as having reference to the "Servant of the Lord" depicted in vers. 1-7, and as calling on the captive Jews to consider his voluntary humiliation, and the object of it. But this view seems to be strained. It requires "deaf" and "blind' to be taken in completely different senses in the two consecutive verses, 18 and 19. Probably Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne are right in taking the whole passage of captive Israel, and especially of that "outer circle" which was least deserving of God's favour and most open to rebuke and reproach. These "blind" and "deaf" ones are warned that it is high time for them to unclose their eyes  and open their ears, and are reminded that all their recent and present sufferings arise from their former "blindness" and disobedience. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, ye deaf</span>. The "deaf" are not absolutely without hearing, nor the "blind" absolutely without sight. They can "hear" and "see," if they choose to do so. When they do not see, it is because they "wink with their eyes" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-15.htm">Matthew 13:15</a>); when they do not hear, it is because, like the deaf adder, they "stop their ears" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4</a>). This, at any rate, is the case with the majority. There may be some who have deadened their moral vision altogether, and have no longer any "ears to hear." God, however, addresses the mass of Israel as still possessed of moral discernment, if they will but use it, and calls upon them to wake up out of sleep - to "hear" and "see."

There were certainly others connected with the tedious and dangerous journey from Babylonia to Palestine (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>).

With Isaiah, in these later chapters it is a favourite epithet, being used of God no fewer than eight times (see ver. 11; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-15.htm">Isaiah 45:15, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-15.htm">Isaiah 47:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-16.htm">Isaiah 60:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-8.htm">Isaiah 63:8</a>) With his eye fixed on the deliverance of Israel out of the double captivity of sin and of Babylon, he naturally had much before him this aspect of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">I gave Egypt for thy ransom</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">I have given</span>; that is to say, "In my counsels I have already assigned to the Persians, as compensation for their letting thee go free, the broad countries of Egypt, Ethiopia, and Seba." Even the latest date assigned by sceptical critics to "the Second Isaiah" would make this a most remarkable prophecy. Egypt was not reduced, nor was Ethiopia made tributary to Persia until several years after the death of Cyrus, whose son, Cambyses, effected the conquests about  <span class="date">B.C. 527-6</span>. Human foresight could not, in the lifetime of Cyrus, have predicted with any certainty what would be the result of collision between Egypt and Persia; much less could it have ventured on the improbable supposition that the remote Ethiopia would submit itself to the Achae-menisn yoke. Yet this was the result of the invasion of Cambyses, who made Egypt a Persian province, and forced the Ethiopians to submit to the payment of an annual tribute (see Herod., 3:97; 7:69). <span class="cmt_word">And Seba</span>. If "Seba" is "the land of Meroe, which is enclosed between the White and Blue Niles" (Delitzsch), it may be  questioned whether really this ever formed a portion of the Persian empire. But Isaiah has probably no very distinct knowledge of the geographical position of Seba, or of the relations between the Sabaeans and the rest of the Ethiopians. He couples the two together, both here and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, as forming two portions of one nation. The subjection of the Ethiopians involves, in his eyes, the subjection of the Sabaeans. And we cannot say that he is wrong, since it is not at all clear that the Sabaeans were not generally spread through Ethiopia, or at any rate scattered in various parts of the country.

Israel became "precious" from the time that the promise was given to Jacob that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>).

Israel had been carried captive into Mesopotamia and into Media (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>), perhaps, also, into other regions belonging at the time to Assyria, as Babylonia, Assyria Proper, Syria. Two hundred thousand Jews had been taken to Nineveh by Sennacherib ('Eponym Canon,' p. 134), and planted probably by him m outlying portions of his dominions. But such transplantation would not carry the dispersion further than Cilicia and Cyprus towards the west, Armenia towards the north, Media towards the east, and the shores of the Persian Gulf towards the south. Any scattering of the nation into regions more remote than these, as into [Egypt, Ethiopia, Elam (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>), and China  - if Sinim is China (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-12.htm">Isaiah 49:12</a>) - must have been seen by Isaiah in vision, or made known to him by revelation. It had not taken place in his day. The expression, "ends of the earth" (ver. 6), must not be pressed in Isaiah any more than in Herodotus, where the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> are India, Arabia, Ethiopia, and Scythia (3:106-116).

(On the need of such escort, see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>.

According to the former rendering, the contrast is between the solemn, serious <span class="accented">history</span> of early times in Genesis, and the grotesque and extravagant myths, in which the nations generally embodied their views of the primitive  ages. (For a specimen of the contrast, see 'Aids to Faith,' Essay 6. pp. 275, 276.) <span class="cmt_word">Let them bring forth their witnesses</span>. Witnesses that the prophecies were really delivered before the events happened, or that the accounts of past times are such as have really come down to them from their ancestors. <span class="cmt_word">Or let them hear and say, It is truth</span>. It is uncertain whether we ought to translate the initial <span class="accented">vau</span> here by "and" or by "or."

Israel has been at all times, and still is, one of the most important witnesses for God that exists in the world. Like the Church, Israel is the "witness and keeper" of a large portion of "Holy Writ." Her past history witnesses for God. Her continued existence and present condition constitute additional testimony. <span class="cmt_word">And my Servant whom I have chosen</span>. To explain this as meaning "and ye are also my servant, whom I have chosen" (Nagelsbach, Cheyne, Delitzsch), is to empty it of all its force. Manifestly, a further witness is adduced, "Ye are my witnesses; and so is my Servant," etc. The "Servant" intended can only be the one true Servant of <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>, since faithful Israel is already among the witnesses. The prophet rises above the consideration of the immediately present, or of the single trial-scene which he is setting before us, and has in mind the great controversy ever going on between those who are for God and those who are against him. He sees, on the side of God <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> faithful Israel: and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ, the "Faithful Witness" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>), who "came into the world that he should bear witness of the truth" (<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>). These are the two witnesses by whom God's truth is maintained in a world of falsehood and delusion. <span class="cmt_word">That ye may know</span>. The subject is changed.

Man cannot make atonement for his fellows; "for it cost more to redeem their souls, so that he must let that alone for ever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>, Prayer-book Version). The human "saviours" whom God raises up to deliver his people out of the hand of their enemies (<a href="../../par/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-5.htm">2 Kings 13:5</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>, etc.), are "saviours" in quite a secondary and inferior sense.

In the native inscriptions the term is especially applied to the inhabitants of the tract upon the sea-coast. <span class="cmt_word">Whose cry is in the ships</span>; rather, <span class="accented">into their ships of wailing.</span> The Chaldeans, flying from the Persian attack, betake themselves to their ships with cries of grief, the ships thereby becoming "ships of wailing." The nautical character of the Babylonians is strongly marked in the inscriptions, where "the ships of Ur are celebrated at a very remote period, and the native kings, when hard pressed by the Assyrians, are constantly represented as going on ship-board, and crossing the Persian Gulf to Susiana, or to some of the islands (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 40, 43, 73; vol. 7. p. 63; vol. 9. p. 60). The abundant traffic and the numerous merchants of Babylon are mentioned by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a>).

The deliverance out of Egypt is glanced at, to prepare the way for the announcement of deliverance from the hand of Babylon. Then "a way was made in the sea" (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-29</a>), "and a path in the mighty waters;" now it will be necessary to make "a way in the wilderness" (ver. 19).

Still the reference is to the events of the Exodus, whereof Israel is reminded, since "the redemption out of Egypt was a type and pledge of the deliverance to be looked for out of Babylon" (Delitzsch). God then "brought out" after Israel, to attack him, "chariot and horse, army and power;" but the result was their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">They shall lie down...  they shall not rise</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they lie down</span>...  <span class="accented">they do not rise</span> (so Cheyne and Delitzsch).

Mr. Cheyne well compares <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-7.htm">Jeremiah 23:7, 8</a>, and also well notes that "the chief glories of the second manifestation are spiritual." Israel in the wilderness was a stiff:necked and rebellious people, given to murmuring, licentiousness, and idolatry. Israel, returned from Babylon, will no more hanker after idols, but will have God's Law "put in their inward parts" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-33.htm">Jeremiah 32:33</a>), and will "show forth God's praise" (ver. 21).

It is, of course, quite possible that the novelty is not <span class="accented">merely</span> in the circumstances of the deliverance, but extends to all its results, among which is the Messianic kingdom - verily, a "new thing" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now it shall spring forth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">already it is springing up</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-9.htm">Isaiah 42:9</a>).

Events are shaping themselves  -  the deliverance approaches. <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye not know it?</span> rather, <span class="accented">will ye not give heed to it</span>? Will not the exiled people, whom Isaiah addresses, turn their thoughts this way, and let the idea of deliverance take possession of their minds, instead of brooding on past and present sufferings (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-30.htm">Isaiah 40:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-17.htm">Isaiah 41:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-22.htm">Isaiah 42:22</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">God is about to make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert</span>. As he led his people out of their Egyptian bondage, first through the Red Sea, and then through a "howling wilderness" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>), so now he will "make a way" for them through a still more desolate tract. We are nowhere historically told by what route the Israelites ultimately returned. If they went by Tadmor and Damascus, they must have traversed a most arid and difficult desert. Even if they did not quit the Euphrates till they reached the latitude of Aleppo, still they must have had some wide tracts of wilderness to cross.

The thought of Israel in the future, redeemed, restored, and "telling out God's praise" (ver. 21), raises naturally the con-trusted thought of Israel in the present and the past, disobedient, full of shortcomings (vers. 22-24), too often guilty of overt acts of sin (vers. 24-28). While reproaching his people, and reminding them that the exile is the wellmented punishment of their past offences (vers. 27, 28), God still promises them pardon if they will appeal to his covenant of mercy (vers. 25, 26). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast not called upon me</span>. The Jews had never been greatly given to prayer. They were a "practical" people, active, energetic, hard-working, busily employed in handicrafts, commerce, or agriculture. David and Daniel, who prayed three times a day (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), were probably exceptions to the general rule. At any rate, it appears here that in the exile the nation had neglected prayer. No doubt there was a nucleus of "faithful men," who did as Daniel did. But with the mass it was otherwise. Hard toil occupied their time. Despair made dull their hearts. They looked for no alleviation of their lot, and lived on in a sort of apathy. <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast been weary of me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for thou hast wearied of me.</span> Thou hast left off praying, because thou wast weary of my service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.

If this reproach is regarded as addressed to <span class="accented">captive</span> Israel, who <span class="accented">could not</span> offer sacrifices, we must explain it by the analogy of the expression, "the calves of your lips" (<a href="../../par/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>). All prayer may be regarded as a sort of offering, and withholding it as withholding sacrifice. But it is possible that the prophet is not addressing captive Israel only, but carrying his thoughts back to the period preceding the Captivity, when there was a general neglect of God's service, and for a time the temple was given up to idol-worship (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-14</a>).

"Sweet cane" is mentioned in the Law only in connection with the "holy anointing oil" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>). But the present passage raises a suspicion that it was practically used in the burnt offerings of private persons (see the next clause). That it was anciently used in Babylonia in sacrifice, appears from the Deluge Tablets ('Transactions of Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3. p. 559, 1. 48). <span class="cmt_word">But thou hast made me to serve with thy sins</span>. "The sins of Israel," as Delitzsch observes, "pressed upon Jehovah, as a burthen does upon a servant." This is a part of the fundamental idea running through the third part of Isaiah, closely connected with the mediatorial office of the "Servant of the Lord," who "bare the sin of many" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>), and on whom "the Lord laid the iniquity of us all" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a>). Israel, both during the Captivity and before, had accumulated a heavy load of sin, not merely by negligence, but by overt acts of guilt (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4, 15, 21-23</a>, etc.).

This section is closely connected with ch. 43, of which it ought to form the conclusion. The prophet cannot bear to leave Israel under a ban - its spiritual guides "profaned," and itself given over to "reproaches." He must end with a brighter prospect. Accordingly, he holds out, in the present passage, the double hope <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of the blessing of an abundant outpouring of the Spirit, to take the place of the preceding "curse" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of a pressing of proselytes into the renovated Church, who will hold it in honour, instead of making it the object of their "reproaches." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet now hear</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "be not dismayed at what has been said. Listen a little longer." <span class="cmt_word">O Jacob my servant</span>, etc. A recurrence to the terms of endearment used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>, showing that words of favour and' promise are about to follow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, <i>which</i> will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb</span> (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 7</a>). "From the womb" is added here for increased emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">Jesurun</span>. The Lord's people have their proper names - Jacob, Israel, Jesurun, or rather, Jeshurun. "Jacob" marks them simply as descendants of the patriarch - the people to whom the promises were made. "Israel" marks their militant character - that as "God's soldiers" they fought his battles and maintained his cause in the midst of a hostile world. The third name, "Jeshurun," which is very rarely used (only here and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5, 26</a>), designates them as "righteous," being a derivative from the root <span class="accented">yashar</span> (or <span class="accented">joshar</span>), equivalent to "upright," and points to that standard of moral excellence which it was their duty to set forth, and which to some extent they did set forth, in a world that "lay in wickedness." Had they been more worthy of the name, it would probably have been oftener applied to them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pour water upon him that is thirsty</span>. "Water" is, in Isaiah, the common metaphor for Divine grace. Sometimes, as in this place (and <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), the simple <span class="accented">maim</span>, "water" or "waters," is the word used. At other times we have instead, or in addition, "rain" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-23.htm">Isaiah 30:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a>), or "dew" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>), or "rivers" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-18.htm">Isaiah 41:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, etc.), or "streams" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-25.htm">Isaiah 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-6.htm">Isaiah 35:6</a>), or "floods" (as in this place). At his coming on earth, our blessed Lord took up the comparison, and has made it familiar to all men throughout the whole Christian world (see <a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 11, 13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>). We may note here that the "water" is only poured on him who is athirst for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed...  thine offspring</span>. Not "Israel after the flesh" only, but also Israel after the Spirit - the true "Israel of God" (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall spring up <i>as</i> among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall spring up as among the grass</span>. The LXX. have, "As grass among the waters;" and this reading is followed by Bishop Lowth, Ewald, and Mr. Cheyne. But there does not seem to be any necessity for departing from the existing Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">As willows</span>. There is some doubt whether the Hebrew word used ('<span class="accented">ereb</span>) is rightly translated "willows." The modern <span class="accented">yarab</span> seems certainly not to be a "willow," but rather a species of <span class="accented">Viburnum</span> (see the long note in Delitzsch's 'Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2. pp. 203, 204, Eng. trans.). It is, however, most strictly a water-plant, growing only "near flowing water." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a></div><div class="verse">One shall say, I <i>am</i> the LORD'S; and another shall call <i>himself</i> by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe <i>with</i> his hand unto the LORD, and surname <i>himself</i> by the name of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One shall say, I am the Lord's</span>, etc. There shall be an influx of proselytes.

"One shall say, I am Jehovah's," - while "another shall proclaim the name of Jacob," as that in which he glories; and a third "shall write on his hand, (I am) Jehovah's, and take as a surname the name of Israel." It was usual among the heathen nations to mark the name of a god upon the bodies of persons specially devoted to him (Herod., 2:113; 7:235); and, though the practice was forbidden to Israelites (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>), it might naturally continue in use among semi-heathen proselytes.

The captive Jews, dwelling scattered in a land the inhabitants of which were, one and all, idolaters, and having by hereditary taint an inclination to idolatry, would be easily tempted, during the long and weary period of the Captivity, to put away the worship and even the thought of Jehovah, who had allowed their subjugation, and conform to the religion of their conquerors. Hence the repeated contrasts in these later chapters - specially addressed to <span class="accented">caprice</span> Israel - between Jehovah and idols, and the sharp ridicule of the  latter (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-18.htm">Isaiah 40:18-25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4-7, 21-29</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord the King of Israel</span>. Therefore entitled to Israel's allegiance (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-15.htm">Isaiah 43:15</a>). And his Redeemer; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel's Redeemer - he who had redeemed them from Egyptian bondage - who will redeem them from the power of Babylon - who, best of all, will redeem them from their sins. <span class="cmt_word">The First...  the Last</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, with the comment). <span class="cmt_word">Beside me there is no God</span>. This had been distinctly asserted in the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-35.htm">Deuteronomy 4:35, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>); but Israel could not be induced practically to believe it. The "gods of the nations" were supposed generally to be realities, actual powers, not perhaps so potent as Jehovah, but still real beings, capable of doing good and harm (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>). It is one of Isaiah's special objects in these later chapters to disabuse Israel of this notion (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-21.htm">Isaiah 41:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5, 6, 14-22</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a></div><div class="verse">And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, as I, shall call</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Who will do (or who <span class="accented">can</span> do) as I do - call events into being, declare them, and set them in order beforehand - who can do this for me (or, in my stead)?

The claim is that, from the first creation of mankind, God has not only prearranged the events that should happen, but has declared them by the mouth of prophets (see <a href="../../par/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>, 23; 9:12-16, etc.). No other has done the same. <span class="cmt_word">The things that are coming, and shall come</span>. Not earlier and later events, but "future events," and "such as will actually come to pass" (Kay, Cheyne). Let the idol-gods declare these, if they are to be entitled to consideration.

Israel need not fear that they will be forgotten or forsaken. God has told them from that time, or, <span class="accented">from the beginning</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3, 7</a>), and declared to them, what he is about to do - viz, destroy Babylon, and give them deliverance.

Unless he can cat and drink, the whole work is brought to a standstill. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-13.htm">Isaiah 44:13</a></div><div class="verse">The carpenter stretcheth out <i>his</i> rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The carpenter</span>, etc. When the smith has done his part in the formation of tools, the carpenter is called into action. His proceedings are traced "extragressively." (Delitzsch). First, he is regarded as in possession of his block of wood. On this he proceeds to stretch out his rule, to obtain the idol's length and breadth. Then he marks out on the block a rough outline with red chalk (<span class="accented">sered</span>). After this he pares away the superfluous wood with planes, or chisels, and marks out the limbs more accurately with the compass, planing and measuring until he has brought the rough block into  the figure of a man, and impressed on it something of the beauty of a man, so that it may seem worthy of remaining in the place where it is set up, whether temple or private house. But there is something necessarily anterior to all this. To obtain his block, the carpenter must first cut down a tree, or have one cut down for him (ver. 14); to obtain a tree, he (or some one for him) must have planted it; for the tree to have grown to a fitting size, the rain must have watered it. So the very existence of these wooden idols depends ultimately on whether it has rained or not - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, whether God has given his rain or withheld it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a></div><div class="verse">He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedars...  cypress...  oak</span>. The second of the trees mentioned is more probably the ilex than the cypress, which does not grow either in Palestine or in Babylonia. Idols would be made of cedar on account of its fragrance, of flex and oak on account of their hardness and durability. Cedar was used as a material for carved figures in Egypt (Birch, 'Contents of British Museum,' p. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest</span>.

Dr. Kay translates, "and he <span class="accented">encourages himself in</span> the trees of the forest," which conveys no very distinct idea; Delitzsch, "and he <span class="accented">chooses</span> for himself among the trees," etc., which is sufficiently clear, but scarcely obtainable from the Hebrew text; Knobel, "he makes himself secure among the trees" (by putting a mark on those which he intends to have), which imparts an idea certainly not contained in the original. <span class="cmt_word">He planteth an ash</span>. It is uncertain, and it does not greatly matter, what tree is intended. The point is that, before trees can grow up, they have to be planted, and that, for them to grow when planted, God's gift of rain is necessary (see the comment on ver. 13).

Diagoras of Melos threw an image of Hercules into the fire on which he was cooking his dinner, and bade Hercules make himself of some use by boiling his turnips. The powerlessness of idols even to help themselves is represented with much force in the Book of Baruch (6:12-15, 17-22, 27, 49, etc.).

Israel, having been exhorted never to forget the impotency of idols (ver. 21), is promised forgiveness and deliverance (vers. 21, 22). Then, heaven and earth are called upon to join in rejoicing over the announcement (ver. 23). Finally, in a noble burst of poetry, God is represented as solemnly declaring his intention of frustrating all the false sayings of the soothsayers concerning his people, and accomplishing their restoration to their own land, and the rebuilding of their temple through the instrumentality of Cyrus (vers. 24-28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remember these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">remember these things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the futility of idols  and the folly of the idol-worshippers.

I have formed thee (so also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-1.htm">Isaiah 43:1, 21</a>; vers. 2, 24). The duty of absolute unquestioning obedience seems contained in the relation of that which is formed to that which has formed it. On the other hand, it may be assumed that he who has formed a thing will have a constant care of it and regard for it - that at any rate he will not "forget" it.

Return unto me. This is an underlying condition, both of restoration and of forgiveness. Only the penitent can be received back into favour. The knowledge, however, that God has, in his counsels, "redeemed" his people generally, may act as a stimulus on individuals to repent and turn to him.

The sympathy of external nature with the fortunes of Israel is assumed throughout Isaiah, as it is throughout the Psalms (see <a href="../../par/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>-8; 24:4-7; 29:17; 30:25, 26; 33:9; 35:1, 2, 7, etc.). If Israel is depressed, the earth must "mourn and languish," the heavens grow dark; the mountains shrink and "be ashamed." If, on the contrary, Israel prospers, heaven and earth, mountain and forest, <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-13.htm">Isaiah 49:13</a>),of the joy felt by the angels over the returning and pardoned sinner; but the context of both passages is in favour of the material heavens being meant.

Break forth into singing (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-7.htm">Isaiah 14:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>). As children and birds sing from the very gladness of their hearts, thereby venting the joy that almost oppresses them, so all nature is called upon, not merely to rejoice, but to give vent to its joy, now that Israel is redeemed and God glorified.

The "messengers" are the prophets generally. Before the return from the Captivity took place, it had been prophesied, not only by Isaiah, but by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>), by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-25.htm">Ezekiel 39:25-28</a>), by <a href="../../par/joel/3-1.htm">Joel 3:1</a>), by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11-15</a>), by Obadiah (Obadiah:20), by Micah (<a href="../../par/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>), and by Zephaniah (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14-20</a>).

"The flood" here is probably the main stream of the Euphrates, while "the rivers" are the various side streams which branched off from it and again united themselves with it. Some commentators regard the drying of Euphrates as a mere metaphor for the exhaustion and ruin of Babylon (Kay); but (with Delitzsch) I should be inclined to understand a reference to the action of Cyrus in drawing off the water of the river (see the comment on Isaiah 42:15).

The mention of Cyrus by name, here and again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>, has no doubt been one of the main grounds on which has been set up the theory of two Isaiahs. It has been thought incredible, or at any rate contrary to the analogy  of prophetical revelation, that so minute a matter as the name of a man should have been announced in prophecy more than a century before his birth. There is, however, the parallel case of Josiah, who, according to the author of the Books of Kings, was announced by name more than three centuries before his birth (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>). And there are the extremely minute facts noted in <a href="../../par/daniel/11.htm">Daniel 11</a>, which were prophetically de-dared from two centuries to three centuries and a half before they happened. It is, perhaps, assuming that we know more than we really do know about the object and laws of prophetic utterance, to lay it down that there can be no minute prophecy except when the prophet is living in the midst of the events. It is certainly a very marvellous thing that Isaiah, living at the close of the eighth and the beginning of the  <span class="date">seventh century B.C.</span>, should -mention a king by name who did not ascend the throne till the middle of the sixth; but no one can suppose that God could not have made such a revelation to him if he pleased. An attempt to minimize the marvel, without postulating two Isaiahs, has been made by the supposition that "Cyrus" was not really a proper name, but an old title of the Persian (Achaemenian) kings, signifying" the sun," and that Isaiah, therefore, only meant to point out Persia as the power which would destroy Babylon, which he had already done in effect in <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>. But, in reality, there is no sufficient ground for either of the two statements <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Cyrus meant "the sun," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That "Cyrus" meant "the sun," rests upon the weak authorities of Plutarch and Ctesias, and has been disproved by Sir H. Rawlinson ('Cuneiform Inscriptions,' vol. 2, p. 112). That it was an old titular name of all the Persian kings is directly contrary to the evidence. Out of fourteen Achaemenian kings, two only bore the name; and they bore it as their one and only personal appellation. It was also borne by an Achaemenian prince who had no other name. It is as purely a proper name as Cambyses, or Xerxes, or Darius. The theory of Dean Plumptre ('Biblical Studies,' p. 195) must therefore be set aside as untenable, and we must face the fact that the great Cyrus, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>, is mentioned in prophecies attributed to a writer whose death cannot be placed much later than  <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>. The name which the Greeks expressed by <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the Romans by "Cyrus," is in the original Persian <span class="accented">Kurush</span>, in the old Babylonian <span class="accented">Kuras</span>, and in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Koresh. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He is my shepherd</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not a mere ordinary king, who was often called "the shepherd of his people (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)," but "my shepherd" - the shepherd of my people, who will tend them and care for them. <span class="cmt_word">And shall perform</span> (literally, <span class="accented">accomplish</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all my pleasure</span>. Cyrus is said by Josephus to have had ibis prophecy pointed out to him on his conquest of Babylon, and to have thereupon determined to fulfil what was written ('Ant. Jud.,' 12:1, &sect; 2). His edict, reported by Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2-4</a>), contained a statement that "Jehovah had charged him to build him a house at Jerusalem." It is difficult to see any sufficient <span class="accented">political</span> object for his restoration of the Jews to their country. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be built</span>; rather, <span class="accented">it shall be built. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy foundation shall be laid</span>; literally, <span class="accented">it shall be founded.</span> The decree of Cyrus found by Darius at Ecbatana required that "the foundations of the house should be strongly laid" (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3</a>), and prescribed its dimensions and materials.

The bronze plating found at Ballarat gave the dimensions, and showed the strength of such gates ('Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archseol.,' vol. 7. pp. 83-88).

Gates of towns were, as a matter of course, secured by bars, which would commonly be made of iron, as the strongest material. Iron was well known to the Babylonians (Herod., 1:186).

Of the treasures which fell into the hands of Cyrus, the greatest were probably those of Babylon (Herod., 1:183) and of Sardis (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:2, &sect; 11). The value of the latter has been estimated at above one hundred and twenty-six millions sterling. <span class="cmt_word">That thou mayest know</span>; or, <span class="accented">acknowledge</span> (for the actual acknowledgment, see the decrees in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a> and Ezra 6:3-5). If these documents are accepted as genuine, or even as true in substance (Ewald), Cyrus must be considered to have identified Jehovah with his own Ormuzd, and to have viewed the Jewish and Persian religions as substantially the same. He would be under no temptation, with so weak and down-trodden a people as the Jews, to resort to politic pretences, as he might be in the case of the Babylonians (see the comment on Isaiah 41:25). <span class="cmt_word">Which call thee by thy name</span> (comp. ver. 1 and <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>).

This second motive is, in a certain sense, the main one. Cyrus is raised up, especially, to perform God's pleasure with respect to Judah and Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26-28</a>). Jacob, his Church, is more important in God's eyes than any individual. No doubt his Church is maintained, in part, that it  may be "a light to lighten the Gentiles;" but it is not maintained solely: or even mainly, for this end. Its welfare is an end in itself, and would be sought by God apart from any further consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Israel mine elect</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have surnamed thee</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "given thee designations of honour," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "my anointed" (ver. 1); "my shepherd" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>); "he who shall do all my pleasure" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Though thou hast not known me; rather, <span class="accented">though thou didst not know me.</span> Cyrus's honours, his titles, his mention by name, etc., were accumulated upon him before his birth, when he knew nothing of God, when, therefore, he had in no way merited them. Thus all was done, not for his sake, but lot the sake of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> the LORD, and <i>there is</i> none else, <i>there is</i> no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I girded thee</span>. As God "loosed the loins" of Cyrus's adversaries (ver. 1), to weaken them, so he "girded" those of Cyrus, to give him strength (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32</a>).

Here we have the third motive of the Divine action respecting Cyrus. The attention of all the world from the extreme east to the extreme west, would be drawn by the wonderful occurrences. Jehovah's hand in them would be perceived, and his sole Godhead would obtain acknowledgment. An impulse was doubtless given to monotheism by the victories of Cyrus and the favour which he showed the Jews; but it cannot be said to have been very marked. Idolatry and polytheism were to a certain extent discredited; but they maintained their ground nevertheless. It was not till the true "Anointed One" appeared - the antitype of whom Cyrus was the type - that the idols were "utterly abolished." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/45-7.htm">Isaiah 45:7</a></div><div class="verse">I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these <i>things</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I form the light, and create darkness</span>. It has been recently denied that there is any allusion in these words, or in those which follow, to the Zoroastrian tenets; and it has even been asserted that the religion of the early Achaemenian kings was free from the taint of dualism. But according to some authorities, "a god of lies" is mentioned in the Behistun inscription; and the evidence is exceedingly strong that dualism was an essential part of the Zoroastrian religion long before the time of Cyrus (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 332, 333, 2nd edit.). It is quite reasonable to suppose that Isaiah would be acquainted with the belief of the Persians and Medes, who had come in contact with the Assyrians as early as B.C.. 830; and a warning against the chief error of their religion would be quite in place when he was holding up Cyrus to his countrymen as entitled to their respect and veneration. The <span class="accented">nexus</span> of the words, "I am the Lord, <span class="accented">and there is none else. I form the light</span>, <span class="accented">and create darkness</span>," is such as naturally to suggest an intended antagonism to the Zoroastrian system. Under that, Ormuzd created "light" and "peace," Ahriman "darkness" and "evil." The two were eternal adversaries, engaged in an inter-ruinable contest. Ormuzd, it is true, claimed the undivided allegiance of mankind, since he was their maker; but Ahriman was a great power, terribly formidable - perhaps a god (<span class="accented">diva</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> certainly the chief of the devas. It was from Zoroastrianism that Manicheism derived its doctrine of the two principles, and to the same source may, with much probability, be traced the "devil-worshippers" of the Zagros mountain chain.

Apparently, Isaiah anticipates that the Israelites will be discontented and murmur at their deliverer being a heathen king, and not one of their own body. He therefore warns them against presuming to criticize the arrangements of the All-Wise, reminding them of his unapproachable greatness (ver. 12), and once more assuring them  that the appointment of Cyrus is from him (ver. 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker!</span> Let the potsherd strive, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">woe unto him that striveth with his Maker</span>, <span class="accented">a potsherd among potsherds of the ground</span>: All men are equally made of "the dust of the ground" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Israel has no prerogative in this respect. He, too, is "a potsherd among potsherds"  - day moulded by the potter; no more entitled to lift up his voice against his Maker than the vessel to rebel against the man who shapes it (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>; and see the comment furnished by St. Paul in the Epistle to the <a href="../../par/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20-24</a>). What would a man think if the clay that he was fashioning objected to being moulded in a particular form, or if a work that he had made exclaimed, "He is a poor bungler - he hath no hands"? Yet this is what a man does who finds fault with the arrangements of the Almighty.

Later on, a more general influx is spoken of (ver. 20); and, finally, a prospect is held out of an ultimate universal conversion (ver. 23). At the same time, judgment is denounced against the idolaters who persist in their idolatry (vers. 16, 20), and they are warned that they will have no share in the coming glories of the Israel of God. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The labour of Egypt</span>, and  <span class="cmt_word">merchandise of Ethiopia and of the Sabaeans</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the laborious Egyptians, and the traffic-loving Ethiopians and Sabaeans."

Each one of them constitutes a call to the nations, and is followed by a conversion to a greater or less extent. <span class="cmt_word">They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who lift up</span> (or, carry) <span class="accented">the wood of their graven image</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>, "They bear him upon the shoulder," where the same verb is used). It was a practice of the idolatrous heathen to carry the images of their gods in processions, generally exposed to view upon their shoulders (Layard, 'Nineveh and its Remains,' vol. 2. opp. p. 451), but sometimes partially concealed in shrines, or "arks" (Rawlinson, 'Herodotus,' vol. 2. pp. 100, 101). There would be still among the "escaped" some who would so act.

Among the direct consequences of the victories of Cyrus will be the downfall, in a certain sense, of the Babylonian idolatry. The prophet expresses the downfall by material imagery, graphically describing the fate of the idols themselves. But we must regard him as exulting mainly in the thought of the blow that would be dealt to idolatry in general, and to the Babylonian fond of it in particular, by the substitution of the non-idolatrous and almost monotheistic Persians for the polytheistic and grossly idolatrous Babylonians, in the sovereignty of the Asiatic world. The Babylonian religion no doubt maintained itself at Babylon until and beyond the time of Alexander; but it had lost all its prestige. From the state religion of the chief empire of Western Asia, it had sunk to the position of a provincial cult. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth</span>. In the later Babylonian period, to which Isaiah's prophetic vision transports him, Bel and Nebo (if we understand by Bel, Bel-Merodach) were decidedly the two principal gods. Of the seven kings of the last dynasty, three had names in which Nebo, and two names in which Bel or Merodach, wad an element. Bel-Merodach and Nebo are the chief gods worshipped by Nebuchadnezzar and Neriglissar. Bel, Nebo, and Merodach are the only three Babylonian gods that receive acknowledgment from Cyrus in the so-called 'Cyrus Cylinder.' Bel is, in the Babylonian, "Bil," or "Belu," and means simply "lord." There was an ancient god of the name, one of the First Triad (Anu, Bel, and Hen or Hod), who came by degrees to be identified with Merodach, the tutelary deity of Babylon. Bel-Merodach was the <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Belus) of the Greeks and Romans, who was worshipped in the great temple of Babylon, now represented by the ruin called "<span class="accented">Babil."</span> His name forms an element in those of Bel-lush, Bel-kudur-azur, Bel-ipni. Bel-zakir-isknn, and Belshazzar, all of them kings or viceroys of either Babylonia or Assyria. Nebu was the Babylonian god of learning, and has therefore been compared to Mercury. He was the special deity of Borsippa. The name is thought to be etymologically connected with the Hebrew <span class="accented">nabi</span>, prophet. The "bowing" and "stooping" of Bel and Nebo has primary reference to the overthrow of their images by the conqueror; but includes also the idea of the fall of the gods themselves in the opinions of men. <span class="cmt_word">Their idols were upon the beasts</span>. The Chaldean images generally - not only those of Bel-Merodach and Nebo, but also of Ann, and Hen, and Beltis, and Ishtar, and Nergal, and Sin, and Shamas, and Gula, and others - would be torn from their shrines, and placed upon the backs of beasts of burden, to be carried off by the conquerors. No doubt this was the case with a large number of the images, which were among the most precious of the spoils seized by the soldiers. But it appears that numerous exceptions were made. Neither Cyrus nor Cambyses touched the famous golden image of Bel-Merodach at Babylon, which was first carried off from the great temple by Xerxes (Herod., 1:183). Cyrus, moreover, restored various idols, which Nabonidus had taken to Babylon from provincial towns, to the temples to which they of right belonged (<span class="accented">Journal of Royal Asiatic Society</span>, January, 1880, art. it.). But though their fate was in tiffs way often delayed, ultimately it is probable every valuable idol was carried off and committed to the melting-pot. <span class="cmt_word">Your carriages were heavy loaden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the things that ye carried</span> (<span class="accented">in procession</span>) <span class="accented">are now borne along heavily.</span> The allusion is to the contrast between the light-hearted carrying of the images on festal occasions by their votaries (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>), and their slow transport to foreign lands on the backs of wearied beasts.

They could not deliver the burden. A distinction is here made between the god and the idol, which have hitherto been identified. The god was, in each case, unable to deliver, or save from capture, the heavy "burden" of gold, or silver, or bronze (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> his own image) which was carried off on the back of the "weary beast." On the contrary, the gods themselves - the "souls" of the images, immanent in them - were carried off with the images into captivity.

The song divides itself into four strophes, or stanzas - the first one of four verses (vers. 1-4); the second of three (vers. 5-7); the third of four (Vers. 8-11); and the fourth also of four (vers. 12-15). The speaker is either Jehovah (see ver. 3, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>) or "a chorus of celestial beings" (Cheyne), bent on expressing their sympathy with Israel <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">Come down, and sit in the dust;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "descend to the lowest depth of humiliation" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-26.htm">Isaiah 3:26</a> and <a href="../../par/job/2-8.htm">Job 2:8</a><span class="cmt_word">).

The "virgin daughter of Babylon" is the Babylonian <span class="accented">people</span> as distinct from the city (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-12.htm">Isaiah 23:12</a>). "Virgin" does not mean "unconquered;" for Babylon had been taken by the Assyrians some half-dozen times ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, pp. 58, 130, 149, 157, 164, 175, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sit on the ground</span>: there is no throne; rather, <span class="accented">sit on the ground throneless</span>, or <span class="accented">without a throne.</span> Hitherto the "virgin daughter" had sat, as it were, on a throne, ruling the nations. Now she must sit on the ground - there was no throne left for her. It is the fact that Babylon was never, after her capture by Cyrus, the capital. of a kingdom. Under the Achsemenian kings she was the residence of the court for a part of the year; but Susa was the capital. Under Alexander she was designated for his capital; but he died before his designs could be carried out. Under the Seleucidae she rapidly dwindled in consequence, until she became a ruin.   <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called tender and</span> <span class="cmt_word">delicate;</span> or, <span class="accented">delicate and luxurious</span> (Cheyne). Babylon had hitherto been one of the chief seats of Oriental luxury. She was "the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>), "the golden city" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). She was given to revelry and feasting, to mirth and drunkenness, to a shameless licensed debauchery (Herod., 1. 199; Baruch 6:43). All this would now be changed. Her population would have to perform the hard duties laid upon them by foreign masters.

Do the hard work commonly allotted to female slaves. Turn the heavy upper millstone all day long upon the nether one (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>). Babylon having been personified as a <span class="accented">female</span> captive, the details have to be in unison. Uncover thy locks. Babylonian women are represented in the Assyrian sculptures as wearing closefitting caps upon their heads (see 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 500). <span class="cmt_word">Make bare the leg...  pass over the rivers</span>. On the way from their own city to the land of their captivity, they would have to wade through streams, and in so doing to expose parts of their persons which delicacy required to be concealed.

It is certainly quite unlike anything else in the song, which would artistically be improved by its removal. If, however, it be retained, we must regard it as a parenthetic ejaculation of the Jewish Church on hearing the first strophe of the song - the Church contrasting itself with Babylon, which has no one to stand up for it, whereas it has as "Redeemer the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-5.htm">Isaiah 47:5</a></div><div class="verse">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness</span>. The second strophe begins, like the first, with a double imperative. The fallen people is recommended to hide its shame in silence and darkness, as disgraced persons do who shrink from being seen by their fellows. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt no more be called The lady of kingdoms.</span> Babylon can scarcely have borne this title in Isaiah's time, or at any earlier period, unless it were a <span class="accented">very</span> remote one. She had been secondary to Assyria for at least six hundred years when Isaiah wrote, and under Sennacherib was ruled by viceroys of his appointment. But Isaiah's prophetic foresight enables him to realize the later period of Babylon's prosperity and glory under Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar, when she became the inheritress of the greatness of Assyria, and exercised rule over a large portion of Western Asia. Nebuchadnezzar was, no doubt, as he is called by both Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a>) and Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37</a>), a "king of kings;" and Babylon was then an empress-state, exercising authority over many minor kingdoms. It is clear that, both in the earlier and the later chapters, the prophet realizes this condition of things (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-6, 12-17</a>; as well as the present passage).

A certain small number - Daniel and the Three Children - were advanced to positions of importance (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48, 49</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/3-30.htm">Daniel 3:30</a>), and, on the whole, well treated. On the other hand, Jehoiachin underwent an imprisonment of thirty-seven years' duration (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Mr. Cheyne says that "the writings of Jeremiah and Ezekiel do not suggest that the [bulk of the] exiles were great sufferers." This is, no doubt, true; and we may, perhaps, regard Isaiah's words in this place as sufficiently made good by the "cruelties which disfigured the first days of the Babylonian triumph" (<a href="../../par/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-12.htm">Lamentations 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). Still, there may well have been a large amount of suffering among the rank-and-file of the captives, of which no historic record has come down to us. <a href="../../par/psalms/138.htm">Psalm 138</a>. reveals some of the bitter feelings of the exiles. <span class="cmt_word">Upon the ancient</span>; rather, <span class="accented">upon the aged.</span> The author of Chronicles notes that Nebuchadnezzar, on taking Jerusalem, "had no compassion on young man or maiden, old man or him that stooped for age" (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>). There is no reason for giving the words of the present passage an allegorical meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-7.htm">Isaiah 47:7</a></div><div class="verse">And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: <i>so</i> that thou didst not lay these <i>things</i> to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever</span>. The idea of "continuance" is one of the primary instincts of human nature. Hence we regard it as certain that the sun will rise on the morrow. We expect things to "continue in one stay," and "to-morrow to be as to-day," if not even "more abundant." Babylon was not much more arrogant than other nations when she assumed that silo would be "a lady for ever." And she had more excuse than almost any other nation. Her capital was one of the most ancient cities, if not the most ancient city in the world (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> ).   Though not unconquered (see the comment on ver. 1), she had yet for two millennia or more maintained a prominent position among the chief peoples of the earth, and had finally risen to a prouder eminence than any that she had previously occupied. Still, she ought to have remembered that "all things come to an end," and to have so comported herself in the time of her prosperity as not to have provoked God to anger. <span class="cmt_word">So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart</span>. "These things" must refer to the calamities about to fall upon Babylon, of which she may have heard before the end came - since they had been prophesied so long previously - but which she did not take to heart. <span class="cmt_word">The latter end of it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the probable issue of her pride and cruelty" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-8.htm">Isaiah 47:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore hear now this, <i>thou that art</i> given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I <i>am</i>, and none else beside me; I shall not sit <i>as</i> a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and now.</span> The third strophe begins here, but with a single, instead of a double, imperative.

The Nabonidus Tablet seems to show that very slight and insufficient preparations for defence were made.! am, and none else <span class="cmt_word">Beside me.</span> This is not self-deification, but only a boast of superiority to all other earthly powers. Zephaniah expresses in exactly similar terms the pride and arrogance of Assyria (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-15.htm">Zephaniah 2:15</a>). I shall not sit as a widow; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in solitude and desolation (<a href="../../par/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>), deserted by the crowds who had sought her marts and delighted in her luxury.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a></div><div class="verse">But these two <i>things</i> shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, <i>and</i> for the great abundance of thine enchantments.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In a moment in one day</span>. The day of the capture of the city by Cyrus, which was the third of Marchesvan,  <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>. Then, "in a moment," Babylon lost the whole of her prestige, ceased to reign, ceased to be an independent power, became a "widow," had a portion of her population turn from her, was brought down to the dust. Loss of children, and widowhood came upon her in their perfection<span class="cmt_word">;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>in the full extent of their bitterness" (Cheyne). Not that Cyrus imitated her common practice by carrying off her entire population; on the contrary, she continued for more than two centuries to be a flourishing and populous town. Twice she revolted from Darius Hystaspis ('Beh. Ins.,' col. 1. par. 16; col 3, par. 13), once, perhaps, from Xerxes (Ctes., 'Ext. Pers,' &sect; 22). Alexander the Great found her walls and her great buildings in ruins, but still she was a considerable place. Cyrus, however, no doubt, carried off a portion of her population, which thenceforth begun to dwindle, and continually became less and less as time went on, until she sank into a solitude. That extreme desolation which the prophets paint in such vivid colours (<a href="../../par/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>:19-22; 14:22, 23; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-10.htm">Jeremiah 50:10</a>:15, 38-40; 2:36-43) was potentially contained in the capture by Cyrus, which was the work of a single day. <span class="cmt_word">For the multitude of thy sorceries...  of thine enchantments</span> (comp. ver. 13; and see also <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7</a>). The word here translated "sorceries" probably means "incantations" or "enchantments," while that translated "enchantments" means "spells." The addiction of the Babylonians to marc is largely attested by the classical writers, and has been proved beyond a doubt by the lately discovered native remains. By these it appears that their magic fell under three principal heads: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preparation and use of spells and talismans, which were written forms engraved on stone or impressed on clay, and worn on the person or attached to the object on which their influence was to be exerted; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the composition and recitation of formulae of incantation, which were supposed to act as charms, and to drive away demons and diseases; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the taking of observations and framing of tables of prognostics and of omens for general use, together with the casting of horoscopes for the special advantage of individuals (see Rawlinson's 'Egypt and Babylon,' p. 58; and comp. Lenor, mant,'La Magic chez les Chaldaens,' and Professor Sayce's papers in the 'Transactions of the Society of Bibl. Archaeol.,' vol. 3:p. 145, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>; vol. 4:p. 302, <span class="accented">et seqq.</span>). The first and second forms of marc are glanced at in the present passage; the third is noticed in ver. 13.

Sic., 2 31, etc.), led them on to that perversion of true science, astrology, which, when once entered upon, seduces the mind from all genuine and fruitful study of the celestial phenomena, and leads it into a labyrinth of absurdities.

The irony is, however, confined to the first half (vers. 12, 13); giving place in vers. 14 and 15 to a scathing sentence of judgment and ruin. <span class="cmt_word">Enchantments...  sorceries;</span> rather, <span class="accented">spells</span>, <span class="accented">enchantments</span> (see the comment on ver. 9).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/47-13.htm">Isaiah 47:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from <i>these things</i> that shall come upon thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels.</span> Mr. Cheyne's rendering is more intelligible, "Thou hast wearied thyself with the multitude of thy consultations." Those at the head of affairs had consulted the diviners of all classes, till they were utterly weary of so doing (compare the "<span class="accented">consultations"</span> of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar with such persons, <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2-11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 8</a>). Yet let one further effort be made. <span class="cmt_word">Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up</span>. These are scarcely three classes of persons, but rather the same class under three designations: "astrologers" (literally, "dividers of the heavens"); "star-gazers," or observers of the <span class="accented">stars</span>; and "monthly <span class="accented">prognosticators</span>," or almanack-makers. The astronomy of the Babylonians consisted primarily in "dividing the heavens" into "houses," or constellations, and thus mapping them out in such a way that the infinite multiplicity, which at first baffles the beholder, might be grasped, reduced to order, and brought within the sphere of distinct cognizance. This work was an eminently useful one, and maintains its place in astronomy to the present day ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2, p. 573). After the heavens were mapped out, and the courses of the sun and moon through the "houses" laid down, "<span class="accented">star-gazers"</span> directed their attention mainly to sun, moon, and planets, noting eclipses, occultations, conjunctions, and the like. All this was legitimate science; but, finally, the greater part of the astronomers launched into astrology, and undertook to prognosticate events from the changing phenomena of the heavens. Almanacks were put forth, in which predictions were made, either specially for a particular year, or generally for all time, based upon astronomical considerations; and on these great dependence was placed. (For a specimen of such an almanack, see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 158-161.)

A favourite metaphor with Isaiah for extreme weakness and incapacity of resistance. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a> it is connected, as here, with fire.

The threat here is that God's wrath shall similarly sweep over Babylon. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame.</span> Mr. Cheyne translates, with much spirit, "They cannot <span class="accented">rescue their soul</span> from the <span class="accented">clutch</span> of the flame."

It was carried on both by land and sea, and was very extensive, including both a large import and a large export trade. Her merchants were, in part natives, in part foreigners. It is the latter who are here specially intended. Seeing the gradual closing in upon Babylon of the Persian armies, and anticipating the worst, they fly in haste from the doomed city, each one making for his own country, and having no thought of interposing to save the people which have so long encouraged and protected them. Probably the greater number of these foreign merchants were either Phoenicians or Arabians. They shall wander every one to his quarter.

"Jacob" is the natural and secular designation; "Israel" is a spiritual or covenant name (Cheyne). Both terms being appropriate to the ten tribes no less than to the two, and the present address being intended especially for the Jewish captives, a further designation is appended - <span class="cmt_word">which are come forth out of the waters of Judah</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-26.htm">Psalm 68:26</a>, "Ye that are of the fountain of Israel," marginal rendering). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> <span class="cmt_word">swear by the Name of the Lord</span>. Swearing "by the Name of the Lord" is an evidence of true religion, to a certain extent (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>). It indicates that there has been, at any rate, no open apostasy. Still, it does not necessarily prove more than this; and, in the present case, it scarcely showed anything beyond mere outward formal conformity. The bulk of the captives "swore by the Name of Jehovah, and made mention of the God of Israel" (camp. <a href="../../par/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a>), but did so not in truth, nor in righteousness; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "without their state of mind or mode of action corresponding to their confession, so as to prove that it was sincerely and seriously meant" (Delitzsch). The condition of the majority of the exiles was that expressed in the words, "This people honoureth me with their lips, but in their hearts are far from me" (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a></div><div class="verse">For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts <i>is</i> his name.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they call themselves of the holy city</span>. It is an indication of their real want of truth and righteousness, that they lay such stress upon what is so entirely outward and formal, as the fact of their belonging to" the holy city," Jerusalem. Compare the boast of the Jews in our Lord's time, "We be Abraham's seed" (<a href="../../par/john/8-33.htm">John 8:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stay themselves upon the God of Israel.</span> Not resting upon him in real faith and true humble dependence, as those Israelites who are mentioned in <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20</a>. but trusting to the facts that they were "Israel," and that God was "the God of Israel," and therefore bound to protect them. God reminds them that, if he is "the God of Israel," he is also "the Lord of hosts" - a term, as Dr. Kay notes, especially connected with the holiness of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-3.htm">Isaiah 48:3</a></div><div class="verse">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did <i>them</i> suddenly, and they came to pass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have declared the former things from the beginning</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-26.htm">Isaiah 41:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7, 8</a>, etc.). "Former things" are here contrasted with the "new things" of ver. 6. Two cycles of prophecy seem to be intended - one of comparatively ancient date, the other quite fresh - both equally showing forth the power of God and his infinite superiority to the idols. It is difficult to determine what the two cycles of prophecy are. Delitzsch suggests that "the former things are the events experienced by the people from the very earliest times down to the times of Cyrus," while "the new things embrace the redemption of Israel from Babylon, the glorification of the people in the midst of a world of nations converted to the God of Israel, and the creation of a new heaven and a new earth." Dr. Kay thinks that the "former things" are those mentioned in the prophecies concerning Babylon generally, the "new things those about to be announced in <a href="../../par/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49-56</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I did them suddenly</span>; rather, sud<span class="accented">denly I wrought.</span>

The idea is still more forcibly expressed in the following clause <span class="cmt_word">- thy neck is an iron sinew;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">a band of iron</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> stiff as if it were made-of the hardest metal. <span class="cmt_word">And thy brow brass</span>. The exact simile here used does not occur elsewhere in Scripture. It seems to be the origin of our expressions, "brazen,<span class="cmt_word">...</span> brazen-faced," "to brazen a thing out." The forehead may be hardened for a good or for a bad purpose; in obstinacy or in a determination to resist evil (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-8.htm">Ezekiel 3:8</a> with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). Here the hardening is evil, marking defiance and self-will. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-5.htm">Isaiah 48:5</a></div><div class="verse">I have even from the beginning declared <i>it</i> to thee; before it came to pass I shewed <i>it</i> thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have even from the beginning declared it</span> (comp. ver. 3). The declaration here made is that God rendered his prophecies more than ordinarily marvellous on account of Israel's obstinacy, not punishing them for it, lint seeking graciously and lovingly to overcome it by adding to the weight of the evidence to which he would fain have had it yield. Had his prophecies been less astonishing, had they in a less degree transcended ordinary human experience, Israel might conceivably have ascribed them and the accomplishment of them to   the false gods. As it was, this was barely possible. <span class="cmt_word">Mine idol...  my molten image</span>. It has been already observed (see the comment on Isaiah 40:18) that there was a strong tendency to idolatry among the Jews, not only before, but during the Captivity. Ezekiel says that those among whom he lived were "polluted after the manner of their fathers, and committed whoredom after their abominations; made their sons pass through the fire, and polluted themselves with <span class="accented">all their idols"</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30, 31</a>); nay, went so far as to declare boldly, "We will be as the heathen, as the inhabitants of the countries, to <span class="accented">serve wood and stone"</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>). The "prevailing tendency," as Delitzsch remarks, was "to combine the worship of Jehovah with heathenism, or else to exchange the former altogether for the latter." We cannot conclude anything concerning the mass of the community from the character of those who returned. Those who returned were the sincere worshippers of Jehovah - the irreligious did not care to return. It is always to be borne in mind that it was "the great mass even of Judah," no less than of Israel, that "remained behind" (Delitzsch); and these "became absorbed into the heathen, to whom they became more and more assimilated" (ibid.). <span class="cmt_word">Hath</span> <span class="cmt_word">commanded them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "hath caused them (the events) to take place" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-6.htm">Isaiah 48:6</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare <i>it</i>?

On the whole, the language used seems most consonant with the view of Dr. Kay, that the "new things" are those about to be revealed in the next section of the prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49.htm">Isaiah 49-53</a>), things belonging to the coming of Christ, and the "new creation" which it will be the great object of his coming to bring about. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-7.htm">Isaiah 48:7</a></div><div class="verse">They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They are created now</span>. The revelation to man of what has lain secret in God's counsels from all eternity is a sort of creation.

The mystery of "the Servant of the Lord," and of atonement and salvation through him, had hitherto been hid away - "hid in God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a>), and was now for the first time to be made known to such as had "eyes to see" and "cars to hear" by the teaching of the evangelical prophet. <span class="cmt_word">Even before the day when thou heardest them not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and before to-day thou heardest them not.</span> Whatever shadows of evangelic truth are discernible in the Law and in the earlier psalms, they did not constitute a revelation of the way of salvation at all comparable to that contained in Isaiah's later chapters. <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them</span>. If the "new things" of Isaiah's prophecy had been revealed many centuries before, they would not have impressed the Jews of Isaiah's time, or even of the Captivity period, as they did by having been reserved to a comparatively late date. They would have seemed to most of them an old and trite story. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-8.htm">Isaiah 48:8</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time <i>that</i> thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou heardest not...  thou knewest not</span>. Again we seem to hear the voice of complaint, as in vers. 1, 2, 4. Israel had not "ears to hear" to any purpose such highly spiritual truths as those of the coming section. They had not profited by what was taught concerning Christ in the Law and the Psalms. <span class="cmt_word">From that time that thine ear was not opened</span>; rather, <span class="accented">from that time thine ear hath not been open.</span> "From that time" means "from of old," or "from the beginning."

Israel's insincerity (ver. 1), obstinacy (ver. 4), addiction to idols (ver. 5), blindness (ver. 8), and general resistance to God's will (ver. 8), could not but have provoked God's "anger." He will, however, "defer" it, "refrain" himself, not "cut Israel off, <span class="accented">for his Name's sake."</span> God, having selected one nation out of all the nations of the earth to be his "peculiar people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), and having declared this, and supported his people by miracles in their struggles with the other nations and peoples, was, so to speak, committed to protect and defend Israel "for his Name's sake," lest his Name should be blasphemed among the Gentiles (see <a href="../../par/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/129.htm">Psalm 129</a>:10; 106:8, etc.). He was also bound by the promises which he had made; and. still more, by the position which Israel occupied in his scheme of salvation, to allow the nation still to exist, and therefore to condone its iniquities and restrain his anger. But the dregs of the cup of vengeance were poured out at last.

Heaven and earth, and all things that are in them, except man, are prompt to perform God's will, and rise up at once at his call to show their readiness. The metaphor is drawn from the conduct of intelligent agents. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14</a></div><div class="verse">All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these <i>things</i>? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm <i>shall be on</i> the Chaldeans.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All ye, assemble yourselves.</span> "Once more the nations are challenged to say which of their deities has foretold the work that the Lord has willed to perform on Babylon" (Kay) (see above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-9.htm">Isaiah 43:9</a>). If none has done so, will not Israel see and acknowledge the superiority of Jehovah to such blind deities? <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath loved him</span>. It had not been previously declared in so many words that Jehovah "loved" Cyrus; but it had been sufficiently indicated by the way in which he was spoken of in <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a> and Isaiah 45:1-5. God "loves" all who "in an honest and good heart" seek according to their lights to do his will and serve him faithfully. Nebuchadnezzar is called his "servant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18, 20</a>), Cyrus (in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>) his "anointed."

The Hebrew is very harsh, and perhaps requires emendation; but the meaning can scarcely be other than that expressed in our version. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-15.htm">Isaiah 48:15</a></div><div class="verse">I, <i>even</i> I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have called him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>, "<span class="accented">Calling</span> a ravenous bird from the east"). Cyrus is represented as raised up by God, "called" by him, and commissioned by him "to do all his pleasure." God has brought him on his way, and made that way prosperous. According to the account of Herodotus, Cyrus received no check of any kind until the last expedition, in which he lost his life. His "prosperity" was beyond that of almost any other commander. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-16.htm">Isaiah 48:16</a></div><div class="verse">Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there <i>am</i> I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - THE THIRD ADDRESS. Israel is reminded of God's merciful teaching and leading in the past (vers. 16, 17); expostulated with on their disobedience (vers. 18, 19); exhorted to go forth boldly and joyfully from Babylon (vers. 20, 21); and finally warned that God's blessings - even such a blessing as deliverance - are no blessings to any but the righteous (ver. 22). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not spoken in secret from the beginning</span>. God, "from the beginning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from his first dealings with Israel, had raised up a succession of prophets, who had declared his will, not "in secret," or ambiguously, but openly and plainly, so that all who heard might understand (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, and see the comment ad <span class="accented">loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">From the time that it was, there am I</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from the time that the earth was, there (in the succession of my prophetic messengers) was I." It was I who spake by their mouth, and thus announced my will publicly. <span class="cmt_word">And now the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath</span>   <span class="cmt_word">sent me</span>. Dr. Kay supposes that "one Divine Personage is here sent by another"  - the Second Person of the Holy Trinity by the First and by the Third; but it is against the analogy of faith that the Third Person should send the Second. Probably Mr. Cheyne is right in suggesting that "here a fresh speaker is introduced," and also right in his supposition that the fresh speaker is "the prophet himself," who tells us that he is now carrying on the goodly succession which has been "from the beginning," and is sent to deliver his message by God (the Father) and his (Holy) Spirit. On the tendency of Isaiah to "hypostatize" the Spirit of God, see the comment on Isaiah 40:13; and compare Mr. Cheyne's note on the same passage ('Prophecies of Isaiah,' vol. 1. p. 243). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-17.htm">Isaiah 48:17</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I <i>am</i> the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way <i>that</i> thou shouldest go.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord...  which teacheth thee to profit</span>. God's teachings are all directed to the "profit" of those to whom they are addressed; and, if received in a proper spirit, actually "profit" them more than anything else can do. "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). Very profitable also are the teachings of God's providence, which chasten men, warn men, and tend to keep men in the right path. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18</a></div><div class="verse">O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou hadst hearkened!</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13-16</a>, "Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways! I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries," etc.) Some render, "Oh that thou wouldst hearken!" etc., on the analogy of <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-1.htm">Isaiah 64:1</a>; but unnecessarily. Dr. Kay says that God "upbraideth not," referring to <a href="../../par/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>. But he may expostulate. What is it but expostulation, when our Lord says, "O Jerusalem, <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27, 28</a>)? To look back on the past, and see what we have missed, is a good lesson for the future. <span class="cmt_word">Then had thy peace been as a river</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as the river</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Euphrates), abounding, overflowing, continuous. Thy righteousness. Not "thy prosperity" (Cheyne), but "thy good deeds." If Israel had clung to God, then God's blessing would have been poured upon them, and have enabled them to bring forth abundant fruits of righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">As the waves</span> <span class="cmt_word">of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the sea;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> innumerable and unceasing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-19.htm">Isaiah 48:19</a></div><div class="verse">Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy seed also had been as the sand</span>. Israel, at the close of the Captivity, was "a remnant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31</a>), a "very small remnant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>); the ten tribes were for the most part absorbed into the heathen among whom they had been scattered; the two tribes had dwindled in number through the hardships of the Captivity, and were scarcely more than a "handful." Less than fifty thousand returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-64.htm">Ezra 2:64</a>); less than two thousand males with Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2-20</a>). Had Israel not been disobedient, the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would have been literally fulfilled, and the descendants of Abraham would have been millions upon millions, instead of being one or two hundred thousand. <span class="cmt_word">The offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof</span>; rather, <span class="accented">like the grains thereof</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grains of the sand. His name; i.e. "Israel's name." Should not have been cut off. Israel's name had not been wholly "cut off" or "destroyed." But it had been approximately "cut off." Israel was no more a people, but only a horde of slaves. The restoration to Palestine was a resurrection - the re-creation of a nation which, humanly speaking, had ceased to be. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a></div><div class="verse">Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it <i>even</i> to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go ye forth of Babylon</span>. A sudden transition from expostulation to exhortation. It might have seemed that no exhortation would be needed; that, as soon as the prison-doors were set open, there would be a general rush to escape. But, when the time came, it was not so. Those only availed themselves of the edict of Cyrus "whose spirit God had raised to go up and build his house" (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-5.htm">Ezra 1:5</a>). The wealthier classes, Josephus tells us ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1), remained. The very poor, it is probable, <span class="accented">could</span> not leave. Motives of various kinds detained others. The result was that probably a larger number elected to continue in the country than to return to Palestine. Hence the exhortation to "go forth from Babylon and flee from the Chaldeans" was far from being superfluous. <span class="cmt_word">Flee ye from the Chaldeans</span>. Not "flee before them" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>), as enemies to be feared; but quit them hastily, as corrupters to be avoided. With a voice of singing; rather, <span class="accented">with a voice of shouting</span> (Delitzsch), or <span class="accented">with a ridging cry</span> (Cheyne). The cry was to reach even to the end of the earth. All the nations were to be informed of the great event, in which they might not <span class="accented">feel</span>, but in which they were, deeply interested - the deliverance of Israel out of Babylon, which was "the prelude of, and a preparation for, the world's redemption" (Kay). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-21.htm">Isaiah 48:21</a></div><div class="verse">And they thirsted not <i>when</i> he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They thirsted</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc</span>). The literal meaning is not to be altogether excluded. We have no historical account of the journey made by the bulk of the exiles who returned with Zerubbabel; but   they must almost certainly have experienced difficulties with respect to water; and it is quite possible that a miraculous supply was vouchsafed to them. Most commentators, however, are content to explain both this and the earlier passage as merely "symbolical." The Israelites - they say - had spiritual refreshment on their homeward journey, by God's goodness, constantly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There is</i> no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- There is</span> <span class="cmt_word">no peace,</span> etc. This warning phrase occurs again, "in the manner of a refrain" (Cheyne), at the close of what most commentators  regard as the second section of this portion of Isaiah's work (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>).

Jehovah called his Servant from the womb; mentioned him by name; made his mouth a sharp sword; held him in his hand; caused him to be a polished weapon; appointed him his Servant; assured him of a right and a recompense; appointed him, not only to restore and recover Israel, but to be a Light to the Gentiles, and to give salvation to the ends of the world (vers. 1-6); chose him (ver. 7); will help him (ver. 8); through him will both deliver the captive everywhere (ver. 9), and cause joy to break out in every part of heaven and earth (vers. 11-13). It is quite impossible that these things can be said of aught but a person, or of any person other than him in whom all the nations of the earth were to be blessed (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Listen, O isles</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1, 4, 6</a>). Since the beginning of ch. 43. Israel alone has been addressed. Now that the mission of the Servant of Jehovah is to be treated of, all the world must be summoned to hear, for all the world is directly interested. <span class="cmt_word">Ye people</span>; rather, <span class="accented">ye peoples</span>, or <span class="accented">ye nations. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord hath called me from the womb</span>. Isaiah could not have said this of himself, for his "call" took place when he was of mature age. But Christ was designated for his office from the womb (<a href="../../par/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31-33</a>). He was also still "in the womb of his mother" when the name of Jesus was given to him (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-21.htm">Matthew 1:21</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>).

The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews says that "the Word of God" generally "is... sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Christian experience testifies that tiffs keen, searching, cutting power attaches in an especial way to the sayings of Jesus, which pierce the heart as no other words can do, and rankle in the soul, which is quite unable to forget them. The imagery recurs in the Revelation of St. John (<a href="../../par/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the shadow of his hand hath he hid me</span>.

That the literal "Israel," is not intended appears plainly from ver. 5. The Servant himself is addressed as "Israel," because he "would stand as a new federal head to the nation" (Kay), which would be summed up in him, and also because he would be, in a truer sense than any other, an "Israel," or "Prince with God." In whom <span class="cmt_word">I will be glorified</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/john/13-31.htm">John 13:31</a>, "Now is the Son of man glorified, and <span class="accented">God is glorified in him"</span>). He who is "the Brightness of the Father's glory" sets forth that glory before men, and causes them to glorify him, both with their tongues and in their lives.

The verse brings strongly out the true humanity of the "Servant," who feels as men naturally feel, but restrains himself, and does not allow his feelings to carry him away. Compare with this despondency the grief exhibited by our Lord on two occasions (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>), and the depression which extorted from him the memorable words, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>). My work; rather, <span class="accented">my reward</span>, or <span class="accented">my recompense.</span>

(On the service which our Lord continually rendered, while on earth, to the Father, see <a href="../../par/luke/2-49.htm">Luke 2:49</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>.) The Revelation of St. John shows that in heaven he is still engaged in carrying out his Father's behests. <span class="cmt_word">Though Israel be not gathered</span>. This reading, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, "entirely spoils the symmetry of the verse." The practice of writing fresh copies of the Scripture <span class="accented">from dictation</span> is answerable for the double reading of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> both here and in other places. <span class="cmt_word">Yet shall I be glorious</span>. The "Servant" would receive glory even by such a partial conversion of the Jews as took place through his ministry. It is never to be forgotten that all the original twelve apostles were Jews, that Matthias was a Jew, that Paul and Barnabas were Jews, and that the original Church was a Church of Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41-47</a>). All that was truly spiritual in Judaism flowed into the Church of Christ, as into its natural home, and the Jewish element in the Church, if not numerically great, was yet the predominant and formative element.

It would have been "a light thing" - "too light a thing" (Kay, Cheyne) - to have rewarded the labours of Jesus with the conversion of the Jews only.

His apostles, after a little time, understood that the gospel was for the world at large, and declared that in Christ there was no difference between Jew and Greek, nay! between Jew and barbarian.

According to a tradition  - which, however, cannot be traced back to any very ancient source - the Magi who came to worship our Lord at Bethlehem   were "kings."

Pilgrims in the East have almost always such marks put upon them when they have accomplished their pilgrimage. English sailors are fond of them, and few are without some such mark on their breast or limbs. The meaning here is that God has the thought of Zion as constantly present with him as if her image were indelibly marked on the palms of his hands.

The object of the prophet is simply to mark the vast growth of the Church, which would necessarily spread itself far beyond the limits of Palestine, and would ultimately require the whole earth for its habitation.

Who has made them my children? Who has trained them?" That they are not her natural children she is sure, since she knows that she has been for a long time "bereaved and unfruitful" (Cheyne) - a captive, and a "wanderer" (Kay). It is certain that the Jewish Church did not at first altogether welcome the incoming of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>, etc.).

The new children - the new converts - are to come from the Gentiles; the fresh "sons" and "daughters" will be carried by the nations in their arms, and by the peoples upon their shoulders. It is usual to expound this and parallel passages (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-4.htm">Isaiah 60:4; 66:20</a>) of the return of the Jews to their own land by favour of the Gentiles, either when the decree of Cyrus went forth, or at some still future period.

Babylon was mighty. By the laws of war she had a rightful claim to her captives. How was she to be induced or compelled to give them up?

Civil disunion is intended, which will break the power of Babylon, and render her an easy prey to the Persians. The recently discovered inscriptions clearly show that this was the case. Nabonidus had alienated the affections of his subjects by changes in the religion of the country, and during the course of the war with Cyrus, many Babylonian tribes went over to the invaders, and fought against their own countrymen (see the 'Cylinder of Nabonidus;' and comp.

As there, in the evil time of God's judgment, the despairing men are represented as" taking hold" of a respectable man to make him their judge, so now the despairing women "take hold" of such a man and request him to allow them all to be regarded as his wives. There has been such a destruction - men are become so scarce - that no otherwise can women escape the shame and reproach of being unwedded and childless. <span class="cmt_word">Our own bread will we eat</span>. They do not ask him to support them; they are able and willing to support themselves. <span class="cmt_word">To take away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">take thou away -</span> the imperative mood, not the infinitive. <span class="cmt_word">Our reproach</span>. Children were regarded as such a blessing in the ancient times that to be childless was a misfortune and a subject of reproach. Hagar "despised" the barren Sarai (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). Her "adversary provoked Hannah sore, because the Lord had shut up her womb" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-6.htm">1 Samuel 1:6</a>). Compare the lament of Antigone, who views it as a disgrace that she descends to the tomb unwed (Soph., 'Antig.,' 11. 813-816). Among the Jews childlessness was a special reproach, because it took away all possibility of the woman being in the line of the Messiah's descent (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1-4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth <i>shall be</i> excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-6.</span> - As the present prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2.htm">Isaiah 2-4</a>.), though in the main one of threatening and denunciation, opened with a picture that was encouraging and comforting (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>), so new it terminates with a similar picture. The evangelical prophet, like the great apostle of the Gentiles, is unwilling that any one should be "swallowed up with overmuch sorrow." He will not separate the mercies of God from his judgments. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day shall the branch of the Lord</span>, etc. Some see in this passage merely a promise that in the Messianic times the produce of the soil would become more abundant than ever before, its harvests richer, and its fruitage more luxuriant. But in the light of later prophecy it is scarcely possible to shut up the meaning within such narrow limits. The "Branch" of Isaiah can hardly be isolated altogether in a sound exegesis from the "Branch" of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>) and of Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>). Now, the "Branch" of Zechariah is stated to be "a man" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>: note that the word used for "Branch" is the same as Isaiah's, viz. <span class="accented">tsemakh</span>), and the "Branch "of Jeremiah is a King (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Moreover, Isaiah uses a nearly equivalent term (<span class="accented">netser</span>) in an admittedly Messianic sense. Although, therefore, there is some obscurity in the phrase, "<span class="accented">Branch</span> <span class="accented">of Jehovah</span>," it would seem to be best to understand Isaiah as here intimating, what he elsewhere openly declares (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1-5</a>) - viz. the coming of the Messiah in the latter days as the ornament and glory of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Be beautiful and glorious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for beauty and glory</span>; or, <span class="accented">for ornament and glory</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the ornament and glorification of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">And the fruit of the earth</span>. It is argued with reason that the two clauses of this verse are parallel, not antithetical, and that as we understand the one, so must we understand the other. If, then, the "<span class="accented">Branch"</span> is the Messiah, so is "the fruit of the earth"-which may well be, since he was "the grain of wheat" which "fell into the ground and, lied, and so brought forth much fruit" (<a href="../../par/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Excellent and comely</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for majesty and beauty</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/28-2.htm">Exodus 28:2, 40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the escaped of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "to those who shall have our-rived the great calamity, and become citizens of the restored Jerusalem." Dr. Kay well remarks that "the prophecy was adequately fulfilled only in those who 'saved themselves' from the generation which rejected Christ. That remnant was the germ of the Catholic Church, made such by being incorporated into the true Vine" ('Speaker's Commentary,' note <span class="accented">at loc</span>.).

It was not revealed to him that there would be an interval of from five hundred to six hundred years between the two events. By God's "<span class="accented">righteousness"</span> here we must understand his righteous plans for the redemption of his people through Christ, and for the punishment of those who resist his will and remain impenitent.

But God, and his power to save, and his eternal law of right, can never pass away, but must endure for evermore.

They that dwell therein shall die in like manner. Dr. Kay observes that the Hebrew text does not say, "in like manner," but "as in like manner." Man is not subject to the same law of perishableness as the external world, but to a different law. External things simply "pass away" and are no more. Man disappears from the earth, but continues to exist somewhere. He has, by God's gift, a life that is to be unceasing.

There has been much doubt as to the utterer of this "splendid apostrophe." Zion, the prophet, the angels, Jehovah, and God the Son pleading with God the Father, have been suggested.

When God neglects the prayers and supplications of his people, he is spoken of as "asleep," and needing to be awoke by a loud cry.

The prophet sees the messenger come bounding over the mountains of Judaea, to bring the news to Jerusalem that her deliverance is come (ver. 7). The angelic watchers sing with joy (ver. 8). The prophet calls upon the waste places of Jerusalem to do the same, and dwells on the greatness of the mercy wrought (vers. 9, 10).

The "watchers" would watch closely God's dealings with his Church, and would see them as clearly as a man sees his friend when he leeks into his face. When the Lord shall bring again Zion. It is, perhaps, best to translate, with Houbigant and Mr. Cheyne, "When the Lord shall return to Zion." The prophet sees God as the Leader of his people, not merely by his providence bringing them back, but "returning" at their head (camp. ver. 12).

Then they were "thrust out;" now there would be no need of hurry. They would have the free permission of their sovereign to depart at their own time, and might proceed with calm deliberateness. God would go before them, as he did on that former occasion (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), though not now visibly; and he would also defend them from attacks by the way, being at once their Guide and their Rereward, or Rearguard. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - PRELUDE TO THE "GREAT PASSIONAL." It is generally allowed by modern commentators that this passage is more closely connected with what follows it than with what precedes. Some would detach it altogether from ch. 52. and attach it to ch. 53. But this is not necessary. The passage has a completeness in itself. It is a connecting link. The exaltation of Israel, the collective "Servant of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 21</a>), brings to the prophet's mind the exaltation of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), through which alone the full exaltation of Israel is possible. He is bound to complete his account of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> by telling of <span class="accented">his</span> exaltation, and of the road which led to it. This is done in ch. 53, in what has been called the "<span class="accented">Great Passional."</span> But the "<span class="accented">Great</span> Pas-signal" needs a "<span class="accented">prelude</span>," an "introduction," if only as indicative' of its greatness. And this prelude we have here, in these three verses, which briefly note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the fact of the exaltation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the depth of the humiliation preceding it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the far-extending blessedness which shall result to the world from both. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My Servant shall deal prudently</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall deal wisely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall so act throughout his mission as to secure it the most complete success.

Even there, however, seems to the prophet rot enough; so he adds, "and exalted exceedingly" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a> and <a href="../../par/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-9</a>).

The prophet, as Delitzsch says, sits at the foot of the cross on Calvary, and sees the Redeemer as he hung upon the accursed tree, after he had been buffeted, and crowned with thorns, and smitten, and scourged, and crucified, when his face was covered with bruises and with gore, and his frame and features distorted with agony.

The Septuagint has, "So shall many nations marvel at him;" and this   translation is followed by Gesenius and Ewald. Mr. Cheyne thinks that the present Hebrew text is corrupt, and suggests that a verb was used antithetical to the "astonied" of ver. 14, expressing "joyful surprise." It is certainly hard to see how the idea of "sprinkling," even if it can mean "purifying," comes in here. <span class="cmt_word">Kings shall shut their mouths at him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of him.</span> In reverential awe of his surpassing greatness (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/7-16.htm">Micah 7:16</a>).

Still, of course, there is rhetorical exaggeration in the question, which seems to imply that no one would believe.

Here it would seem to refer especially to the Messianic prophecies delivered by Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</span> The "arm of the Lord," which has been "made bare in the eyes of all the nations" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>), yet requires the eye of faith to see it. Many Jews would not see the working of God's providence in the victories of Cyrus, or in the decision to which he came to restore the Jews to their own country. Unbelief can always assign the most plainly providential arrangements to happy accident.

The "branch" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a> - a different word - has nearly the same meaning.

Either out of the "dry ground" of a corrupt age and nation, or out of the arid soil of humanity. In the East it is not unusual to see a tall succulent plant growing from a soft which seems   utterly devoid of moisture. Such plants have roots that strike deep, and draw their nourishment from a hidden source. <span class="cmt_word">He hath no form nor comeliness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he had no form nor majesty.</span> It is scarcely the prophet's intention to describe the personal appearance of our Lord. What he means is that "the Servant" would have no splendid surroundings, no regal pomp nor splendour - nothing about him to attract men's eyes, or make them think him anything extraordinary. It is impossible to suppose that there was not in his appearance something of winning grace and quiet majesty. but it was of a kind that was not adapted to draw the gaze of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">And when we shall see him</span>. Some connect this clause with the preceding, and translate, "He hath no form nor comeliness, that we should regard him; no beauty, that we should desire him" (Lowth, Vitringa, Gesenius, Ewald, Knobel, Henderson, Urwick. But Stier, Delitzsch, Kay, and Mr. Cheyne prefer the construction found in the Authorized Version). No beauty; literally, no <span class="accented">sightliness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nothing to attract the eye or arrest it.

The translation of the Authorized Version may therefore be retained. <span class="cmt_word">We hid as it were our faces from him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and there was as it were the hiding of the face from him.</span> Some suppose the hiding of God's face to be intended; but the context, which describes the treatment of the Servant by his fellow-men, makes the meaning given in our version far preferable. Men turned their faces from him when they met him, would not see him, would not recognize him (comp. <a href="../../par/job/19-13.htm">Job 19:13-17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-10.htm">Job 30:10</a>).

Having set forth at length the fact of the Servant's humiliation (vers. 2, 3), the prophet hastens to declare the reason of it. Twelve times over within the space of nine verses he asserts. with the most emphatic reiteration, that all the Servant's sufferings were vicarious, borne for him, to save him from the consequences of his sins, to enable him to escape punishment. The doctrine thus taught in the Old Testament is set forth! with equal distinctness in the New (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-50.htm">John 11:50-52</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6-8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, etc.), and forms the hope, the trust, and the consolation of Christians. and carried our sorrows. The application which St. Matthew makes of this passage to our Lord's miracles of healing (Matthew 8:17) is certainly not the primary sense of the words, but may be regarded as a secondary application of them. Christ's sufferings were the remedy for all the ills that flesh is heir to. <span class="cmt_word">Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God</span>. They who saw Christ suffer, instead of understanding that he was bearing the sins of others in a mediatorial capacity, imagined that he was suffering at God's hands for his own sins. Hence they scoffed at him and reviled him, even in his greatest agonies (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39-44</a>). To one only, and him not one of God's people, was it given to see the contrary, and to declare aloud, at the moment of the death, "Certainly this was a righteous Man" (<a href="../../par/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>).

"No stronger expression could be found in Hebrew to denote severity of suffering - suffering unto death" (Urwick). <span class="cmt_word">The chastisement of our peace was upon him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the chastisement which brought us peace," which put a stop to the enmity between fallen man and an offended God - which made them once more <span class="accented">at one</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-15.htm">Ephesians 2:15-17</a>, "Having <span class="accented">abolished in his flesh the enmity</span>, even the Law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, <span class="accented">so making peace</span>; and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, <span class="accented">having slain the enmity thereby:</span> and came and preached <span class="accented">peace</span> to you which were afar off;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>, "Having <span class="accented">made peace</span> through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself"). <span class="cmt_word">With his stripes we are healed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we were healed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>, "By whose stripes ye were healed"). Besides the blows inflicted on him with the hand (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27</a>) and with the reed (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-30.htm">Matthew 27:30</a>), our Lord was judicially scourged (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>). Such scourging would leave the "stripe-marks" which are here spoken of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a></div><div class="verse">All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All we like</span> <span class="cmt_word">sheep have gone astray.</span> "All we" means either the whole nation of Israel, which "went astray" in the wilderness of sin (<a href="../../par/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>), or else the whole race of mankind, which had wandered from the right path, and needed atonement and redemption even more than Israel itself <span class="cmt_word">We have turned every one to his own way.</span> Collectively and individually, the whole world had sinned. There was "none that did good" absolutely - "no, not one" (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-3.htm">Psalm 14:3</a>). All had quitted "the way of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>) to walk in their "own ways" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath laid on him</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Lord caused to light upon him.</span> God the Father, as the primary Disposer of all things, lays upon the Son the burden, which the Son voluntarily accepts. He comes into the world to do the Father's will. He prays to the Father, "Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but <span class="accented">as thou wilt"</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). So St. John says that the Father "sent the Son to be the Propitiation for our sins" (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-10.htm">1 John 4:10</a>). And St. Paul tells us that God (the Father) "made him to be sin for us who knew no sin" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). It does not lessen the Son's exceeding mercy and loving-kindness in accepting the burden, that it was laid upon him by the Father. <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of us all</span> (compare the initial "All we"). The redemption is as universal as the sin, at any rate potentially. Christ on the cross made "a full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice<span class="cmt_word">...</span> for the sins of the whole world." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a></div><div class="verse">He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was oppressed</span>. As Israel under the Egyptian taskmasters (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The cruel ill usage in the high priest's house, and before Herod is, perhaps, specially pointed at. <span class="cmt_word">He was afflicted</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he abased himself</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a> and <a href="../../par/exodus/10-3.htm">Exodus 10:3</a>). The position of the emphatic pronoun (<span class="accented">hu</span>) <span class="accented">be</span>tween the first participle and the second detaches the second clause from the first and conjoins it with the third. Otherwise the rendering of the Authorized Version might stand. Translate, <span class="accented">He was oppressed</span>, <span class="accented">but he abased himself and opened not his mouth.</span> The silence of Jesus before his judges (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-62.htm">Matthew 26:62, 63</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-14.htm">Matthew 27:14</a>), when he could so easily have vindicated himself from every charge, was a self-abasement. It <span class="accented">seemed</span> like an admission of guilt. <span class="cmt_word">He opened not his mouth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2, 9</a>). The contrast of the Servant's silence and passivity with men's ordinary vehemence of self-assertion under ill usage is most striking. Who was ever silent but he under such extremity of provocation? (For a contrast, see the account of the Jewish martyrdoms in 2 Macc. 7.) <span class="cmt_word">He is brought as a lamb</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as the lamb.</span> The Paschal lamb is, perhaps, intended, or, at any rate, the lamb of sacrifice. The prophet has often seen the dumb, innocent lamb led in silence to the altar, to be slain there, and thinks of that touching sight. It was probably the use of this imagery here which caused the Baptist to term our Lord "the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As a sheep before her shearers</span>. A second image, a reflex of the first, somewhat weaker, as so often in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24, 27, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-8.htm">Isaiah 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-14.htm">Isaiah 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-7.htm">Isaiah 25:7</a>, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a></div><div class="verse">He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was taken from prison and from judgment</span>; rather, <span class="accented">by oppression and a judgment was he taken away</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (us Dr. Kay says) "by a violence which cloaked itself under the formalities of a legal process." The Septuagint Version, which is quoted by Philip the deacon in the Acts (Isaiah 8:33), must have been derived from quite a different text. It preserves, however, the right rendering of the verb, "was he taken away," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> removed from the earth. <span class="cmt_word">Who shall declare his generation?</span> literally, <span class="accented">his generation who considereth</span>? The meaning is obscure. Dr. Kay understands by "his generation," his lifetime or his life, comparing <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>, "Mine <span class="accented">age</span> is departed," where the same word is used and accompanied by a pronominal suffix. Mr. Urwick suggests that it includes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> his origin; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> his earthly life; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> his everlasting reign in heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Others (Delitzsch, Gesenius, Cheyne) take "his generation" to mean "the men of his generation," and join the clause with what follows: "As   for those of his generation, which of them considered that he was cut off," etc.? <span class="cmt_word">He was</span> <span class="cmt_word">cut off;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> taken away before his time, cut down like a flower (comp. <a href="../../par/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). The land of the living. The present world, the earth (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-11.htm">Isaiah 38:11</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/job/28-13.htm">Job 28:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/116-9.htm">Psalm 116:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-19.htm">Jeremiah 11:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the transgression of my people was he stricken</span>. The sentiment is the same as in ver. 5, but with the difference that there it was suffering only, here it is death itself, which the Servant endures for man. "My people" may be either "God's people" or "the prophet's people," according as the speaker is regarded as Isaiah or Jehovah. Jehovah certainly becomes the Speaker in vers. 11, 12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither <i>was any</i> deceit in his mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made his grave with the wicked</span>; rather, <span class="accented">they assigned him his grave with the wicked.</span> The verb is used impersonally. Those who condemned Christ to be crucified with two malefactors on the common execution-ground - "the place of a skull" - meant his grave to be "with the wicked," with whom it would naturally have been but for the interference of Joseph of Arimathaea. Crucified persons were buried with their crosses near the scene of their crucifixion by the Romans<span class="cmt_word">. And with the rich in his death</span>; or, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">he was</span>) <span class="accented">with a rich one after his death.</span> In the preceding clause, the word translated "the wicked" is plural, but in the present, the word translated "the rich" is singular. The expression translated "in his death" means "when he was dead," "after death" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-31.htm">1 Kings 13:31</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>). The words have a singularly exact fulfilment in the interment of our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. The preposition used may mean either "because" or "although." The ambiguity is, perhaps, intentional. <span class="cmt_word">He had done no violence</span>; or, no <span class="accented">wrong</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-17.htm">1 Chronicles 12:17</a>; <a href="../../par/job/19-7.htm">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/35-11.htm">Psalm 35:11</a> (margin); <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>). The LXX. give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> while St. Peter renders the word used by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>). The sinlessness of Christ is asserted by himself (<a href="../../par/john/8-46.htm">John 8:46</a>), and forms the main argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews for the superiority of the new covenant over the old (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>). It is also witnessed to by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>), by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>), and by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>). As no other man was ever without sin, it follows that the Servant of the present chapter <span class="accented">must</span> be Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a></div><div class="verse">Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put <i>him</i> to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see <i>his</i> seed, he shall prolong <i>his</i> days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him</span> (see the comment on ver. 6, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>). The sufferings of Christ, proceeding from the "determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), and being permitted by him; were in some sort his doing. It "pleased him," moreover, that they should be undergone, for he saw with satisfaction the Son's self-sacrifice, and he witnessed with joy man's redemption and deliverance effected thereby. He hath put him to grief; rather, <span class="accented">he dealt grievously -</span> a sort of <span class="accented">hend-adys.</span> "He bruised him with a grievous bruising." <span class="cmt_word">When thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin</span>. It is proposed (Ewald, Cheyne), by the alteration of a letter, to make the passage run thus: "When <span class="accented">he</span> shall make his soul an offering," etc., and argued that "he who offers the Servant's life as a sacrifice must be the Servant himself, <span class="accented">and not</span> Jehovah" (Cheyne). No doubt the Servant did offer his own life (see <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>," He gave his soul a ransom for many"); but that fact does not preclude the possibility of the Father having also offered it. "Believest thou not," said our Lord to Philip, "that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works" (<a href="../../par/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>). This <span class="accented">perienchoresis</span>, as the ancient theologians called it, makes it possible to predicate of the Father almost all the actions which can be predicated of the Son - all, in fact, excepting those which belong to the Son's humanity, or which involve obedience and subordination. As the Father had "laid on Christ the iniquity of us all" (ver. 6), as he had "bruised him and put him to grief," so he might be said to have "made his soul an offering for sin." All was settled in the Divine counsels from all eternity, and when the ideal became the actual, God the Father wrought with God the Son to effectuate it. "Offerings for sin," or "guilt offerings," were distinct from "sin offerings." The object of the former was "satisfaction," of the latter "expiation." The Servant of Jehovah was, however, to be both. "As in ver. 5 the Divine Servant is represented as a Sin Offering, his death being an expiation, so here he is described as a Guilt Offering, his death being a satisfaction" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 151). <span class="cmt_word">He shall see his</span> <span class="cmt_word">seed</span>. The "seed" of a teacher of religion are his disciples. St. Paul speaks of Onesimus as one whom he had "begotten in his bends" (<a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>). He calls himself by implication the "father" of his Corinthian converts (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Both he and St. John address their disciples as "little children" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-1.htm">1 John 2:1, 18, 25</a> I:3:7, 18 I:4:4 I:5:21). It had long previously been promised that "a seed should serve" Messiah (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>). Our Lord himself occasionally called his disciples his "children" (<a href="../../par/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-5.htm">John 21:5</a>). He has always "seen his seed" in his true followers. <span class="cmt_word">He shall prolong his days.</span> A seeming contradiction  to the statement (ver. 8) that he should be "cut off" out of the land of the living; and the more surprising because his death is made the condition of this long life: "When thou shalt make his soul an offering [or, 'sacrifice'] for sin," then "he shall prolong his days." But the resurrection of Christ, and his entrance upon an immortal life (<a href="../../par/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), after offering himself as a Sacrifice upon the cross, exactly meets the difficulty and solves the riddle (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pleasure of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> "In his hand" means "by his instrumentality." The "pleasure of the Lord" is God's ultimate aim and end with respect to his universe. This would "prosper" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> be advanced, wrought out, rendered effectual - by the instrumentality of Christ. "Taking the verse as a whole, it sets forth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the origin, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the nature, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the result of the Saviour's sufferings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Taking the last clause by itself, we have <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Divine complacency in the purpose of human salvation; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the successful issue of that purpose as administered by the Messiah" (Urwick, 'The Servant of Jehovah,' p. 153).

No cross - no crown. First, suffering, then glory. <span class="accented">Because</span> Christ suffered, and was bruised, and put to grief, and made a sacrifice for sin; <span class="accented">because</span> of all this "travail of his soul,"  <span class="accented">- therefore</span> it was given him to see the happy results of his sufferings - the formation of that Church which will live with him for ever in heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-17</a>), and therewith to be "<span class="accented">satisfied."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify</span> <span class="cmt_word">many;</span> <span class="accented">i.e. "</span>by his knowledge of the Divine counsels and purpose, which he will impart to his disciples, shall my righteous Servant justify many" (literally, <span class="accented">the many</span>), or, in other words, "turn them from sin to righteousness" (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>). Nothing is so effectual in turning men to righteousness as teaching them the true knowledge of God  - his nature, his purposes with regard to them, his feelings towards them. Christ, from his own knowledge, gave men this knowledge, and so did all that could be done to draw them to his Father. And his efforts were not without result. The fruit of his teaching has been the justification of many - ay, of "the many," as both Isaiah and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/5-19.htm">Romans 5:19</a>) testify. For he shall bear their iniquities; rather, <span class="accented">and their iniquities he himself shall bear.</span> The initial part of the clause is not "causal," but merely connective. There are two main things which Christ does for his people - he makes them righteous by infusing into them of his own righteousness; and he bears the burden of their iniquities, taking them upon himself, and by his perpetual intercession obtaining God's forgiveness of them. As Delitzsch says, "His continued taking of our trespasses upon himself is merely the constant presence and presentation of his atonement, which has been offered once for all. The dead yet living One, because of his one self-sacrifice, is an eternal Priest, who now lives to distribute the blessings which he has acquired" ('Commentary on Isaiah,' vol. 2:p. 338).

There is no close connection between this chapter and the last, or even between this section and the preceding. Vers. 1-5 take up the thought of <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19-21</a>, and expand it. Israel is assured of a great enlargement of her numbers, and bidden to rejoice thereat. She is then further comforted with a   promise that she shall never be forsaken (vers. 6-10). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sing, O barren</span>. Israel in captivity is addressed as "barren," because, in the time of suffering, her numbers rather diminished than increased. Still, she is bidden to "sing" on account of the prospect that is opening upon her. She that is now desolate and solitary will soon have more children than she formerly had, when she was a married wife, enjoying the fellowship of Jehovah, her Husband (ver. 5). The "children" spoken of are in part those who gathered themselves together in Jerusalem and the adjacent territory after the issue of the decree of Cyrus (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2-34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1-65</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-1.htm">Ezra 8:1-20</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-6.htm">Nehemiah 7:6-72</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-3.htm">Nehemiah 11:3-36</a>), but mainly such as flocked in from the Gentiles, both before and after Christ's coming (see ver. 3).

The special "reproach of her widowhood" was the Babylonian captivity, with the sins that had brought it about.

"I," says the prophet, "have called thee married and widowed, thereby yoking thee to a husband, <span class="accented">for</span> thou hast a Husband, namely, thy Maker." (The Hebrew has both words in the plural, to accord with the following <span class="accented">Elohim.</span>) This relationship of God to his Church is often asserted by the prophets (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-4.htm">Song of Solomon 1:4</a>, etc.), and lies at the root of the oft-recurring metaphor by which idolatry is called "lewdness," "adultery," or "playing the whore<span class="cmt_word">."

The sixty or seventy years of the Captivity were but as a moment of time compared with the long ages during which God had tenderly watched over and protected his Church, and, still more, compared with the eternity during which he was now about to show himself her constant Guardian and Protector. There had been a little wrath; or rather, <span class="accented">one burst of wrath</span>; and then Mercy had resumed her sway. The face hid for a moment had been allowed once more to shine upon the afflicted people; and the momentary indignation would be followed by, and swallowed up in, ever-lasting  kindness (compare above, <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>, "His anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning").

The existing calamity - Israel submerged in the flood of Babylonian captivity-is as it were a repetition of the calamity of the Deluge in God's eyes. Its object is to purify his Church, as the object of the Flood was to purify the world. A righteous household survived in the one case; a righteous remnant would go forth in the other. And as God bound himself in Noah's time not to repeat the calamity of the Deluge, so now he binds himself not again to submerge his Church in a captivity like the Babylonian. It has been said that the promise was not kept, since the Jewish Church was, in A.D. , carried captive by the Romans. But the prophet views the Jewish Church as continued in the Christian, into which all its better and more spiritual members passed at the first preaching of the gospel; and the promise here made is thus parallel to that of our Lord, "Upon this rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). Much as the Christian Church has suffered from the world, it has never been in like cases with the Jewish Church in Babylon, and, as God is faithful, never will be reduced to such extremity. <span class="cmt_word">As I have sworn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pledged myself."

Hitherto Israel has been addressed; now the direct object of address is Jerusalem. The eye of the prophet passes, however, with a glance, from the actual present to the far-distant future, and sees the Zion of God in her heavenly setting, all bedecked with precious stones, as she was seen by the exile of Patmos more than seven centuries later (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16-21</a>). After briefly describing the heavenly city, he passes to her inhabitants, and promises them peace, protection, and righteousness. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O thou afflicted</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-14.htm">Isaiah 49:14-17</a>).

The prophet passes from the ideal to the actual, from the glorious future to the unsatisfactory present. The people are not ripe for the blessings of the Messianic kingdom - they do not sufficiently value them. Hence a tender exhortation is addressed to them by God himself, inviting them to become more spiritually minded (vers. 1-3), and fresh promises are held out to the obedient (vers. 3-5). The disobedient are then somewhat sternly exhorted to turn from their evil ways and repent (vers. 6, 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ho, every one that thirsteth!</span> Though the mass are gross and carnally minded, there will ever be some who have higher aspirations - who hunger and thirst after righteousness" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>), and desire spiritual blessings. These are invited, first of all, to come and partake of the good things provided for them in Messiah's kingdom<span class="cmt_word">. Come ye to the waters</span> (on the spiritual symbolism of water, see the homiletics on Isaiah 44:3, 4). Here the "peace" and "righteousness" of the Messianic kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13, 14</a>) are especially intended. Our Lord's cry on the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/john/7-7.htm">John 7:7</a>) is clearly an echo of this. <span class="cmt_word">Wine and</span> <span class="cmt_word">milk</span>. These are not symbols of temporal blessings, as many have thought. "Wine, water, and milk are," as Delitzsch says, "figurative representations of spiritual revival, re-creation, and nourishment." <span class="cmt_word">Without money and</span> <span class="cmt_word">without price</span>. God's spiritual gifts are freely given to men; they cannot be purchased. Being in their own nature "more precious than rubies," their value transcends human means of payment. They cannot even be earned by man's best works; for man's best works are comprised in his duty to God, and have, therefore, no purchasing power. God may choose to reward them; but if he does it is of his free grace.

The affections of the great mass of the Israelites were set on worldly things, on enriching themselves - adding field to field, and house to house (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>). They did not care for spiritual blessings, much less "hunger and thirst" after them. That which satisfieth not. Worldly things can never satisfy the heart, not even the heart of the worldly. "<span class="accented">What fruit</span> had ye then in those things," says St. Paul, "whereof ye are now ashamed?" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hearken diligently unto me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">hearken</span>, <span class="accented">oh</span>, <span class="accented">hearken unto me.</span> The phrase is one of earnest exhortation. It implies the strong disinclination of Israel to listen, and seeks to overcome it (compare the opening words of the next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Let your soul delight itself in</span> <span class="cmt_word">fatness</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/36-8.htm">Psalm 36:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>; and <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>). The spiritual blessings of the Messianic kingdom are richer dainties than any that this world has to offer. The soul that obtains them "delights" in them, and is satisfied with them (<a href="../../par/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a></div><div class="verse">Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, <i>even</i> the sure mercies of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come unto me</span> (comp. ver. 1, "Come ye to the waters"). God dispenses the waters (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will make an everlasting covenant with you</span>. That the "everlasting covenant" once made between God and man had been broken by man, and by Israel especially, is a part of the teaching contained in the earlier portion of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>). We find the same asserted in the prophecies of his contemporary, Hosea (Hosea 6:7). It would naturally follow from this that, unless God gave up man altogether, he would enter into a new covenant with him. Accordingly, this new covenant is announced, both in Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-18.htm">Hosea 2:18-20</a>) and in the later chapters of Isaiah, repeatedly (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-4.htm">Isaiah 56:4, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-8.htm">Isaiah 61:8</a>). Having been thus set before the nation, it is further enlarged upon by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-40.htm">Jeremiah 32:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-5.htm">Jeremiah 11:5</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60-62</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26-28</a>). Almost all commentators allow that the Christian covenant is intended - that "new covenant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>) under which man obtains pardon and salvation through the Mediatorship of Christ<span class="cmt_word">. Even the sure mercies of David</span>. The "sure mercies of David" are the loving and merciful promises which God made to him. These included the promise that the Messiah should come of his seed, and sit on his throne, and establish an everlasting kingdom (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-2.htm">Psalm 89:2-5, 19-37</a>), and triumph over death and hell (<a href="../../par/psalms/16-9.htm">Psalm 16:9, 10</a>), and give peace and happiness to Israel (<a href="../../par/psalms/132-15.htm">Psalm 132:15-18</a>). The promises made to David, rightly understood, involve all the essential points of the Christian covenant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/55-4.htm">Isaiah 55:4</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I have given him <i>for</i> a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I have given him for a witness</span>. By ordinary rules of grammar, the pronoun "him" should refer to David; and   so the passage is understood by Gesenius, Maurer, Hitzig, Ewald, Knobel, Delitzsch, and Mr. Cheyne. But, as Isaiah frequently sets aside ordinary grammatical rules, and as the position to the person here spoken of seems too high for the historical David, a large number of commentators, including Vitringa, Michaelis, Dathe, Rosenmuller, Umbreit, and Dr. Kay, consider that the Messiah is intended. It is certainly difficult to see how the historical David could be, at this time and in the future, a "leader and commander to the peoples" who were about to flock into the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> <span class="cmt_word">witness...  a leader and commander.</span> Christ was all these. He "came to bear witness to the truth" (<a href="../../par/john/18-37.htm">John 18:37</a>), and "before Pilate witnessed a good confession" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>). He "feeds and leads" his people (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>), and is the "Commander" under whose banner they serve (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3, 4</a>). What he is to his people, he is also of the "peoples" generally; for they have been called into his kingdom, <span class="cmt_word">People...</span>  <span class="cmt_word">people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">peoples.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, thou shalt call a nation <i>that</i> thou knowest not, and nations <i>that</i> knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call a nation that</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou knowest not</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43</a>). The object of address in this verse appears to be the Messiah. He, at his coming, will "call" into his kingdom "a nation," or rather, "people," with whom he has had no covenant hitherto; and they will readily and gladly obey the call. Thus God's kingdom will be enlarged, and Israel's glory will be increased<span class="cmt_word">, Because of the Lord...  for he hath glorified thee</span>. The great cause of the attraction will be the "glory" which God the Father has bestowed upon his Son, by raising him from the dead, and exalting him to a seat at his right hand in heaven (<a href="../../par/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-35</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13-15</a>).

Again the strain changes. The people are once more addressed, but in a tone of reproach. Israel must "seek the Lord" without delay, or the opportunity will be past; God will have withdrawn himself from them. He "will not alway be chiding, neither keepeth he his anger for ever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/103-9.htm">Psalm 103:9</a>).

A general promise of forgiveness of sin upon repentance and amendment of life was first given to Israel through Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The doctrine is largely preached by the prophets; but is nowhere more distinctly and emphatically laid down than in this place. God's will is to "multiply pardon," if man will only turn to him.

Man can scarcely conceive of the deliverance which God designs; but God's thoughts are not as man's (vers. 8, 9). God's word, once pronounced, is potent to effect its purpose (vers. 10, 11). Deliverance from Babylon, having been promised, will take place, and will be accompanied by all manner of spiritual blessings (vers. 12, 13). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My thoughts are not your thoughts</span>. Though man is made in God's image (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), yet the nature of God in every way infinitely transcends that of man. Both the thoughts and the acts of God surpass man's understanding. Men find it hard to pardon those who have offended them; God can pardon, and "pardon abundantly." Men cannot conceive of coming changes, when they pass certain limits. God knows assuredly what changes are approaching, since they are his doing.

The rain and the snow are God's ministers (<a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>), and go forth from him, just as his word does. They have an appointed work to do, and do not return to him, whose ministers they are, until they have done it. It is best to translate, with Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne, "As the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, except it hath watered the earth," etc. The writer is, apparently, aware, as the writer of Ecclesiastes is, that the water which falls from heaven in the shape of rain does return thither again in the shape of vapour (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:7</a>).

With the utterance the result is achieved. Hence the sublime passage, which even heathenism could admire (Longin., 'De Sublim.,' &sect; 9), "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>). Hence, too, the more general statement, "By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/148-5.htm">Psalm 148:5</a>). But it shall accomplish; rather, <span class="accented">unless it has accomplished.</span> There is a mixture of two constructions, "It shall not return void," and "It shall not return unless it has accomplished," etc. <span class="cmt_word">It</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall prosper.</span> Every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God has a prosperous course. It is endued with life from God, and (as Delitzsch says) "runs like a swift messenger through nature and the world of man, there to melt the ice, as it were, and here to heal and to save; and it does not return from its course till it has given effect to the will of the Sender. "The special "word" which the prophet has here in mind is the promise, so frequently given, of deliverance from Babylon and return in peace and joy to Palestine. But he carries his teaching beyond the immediate occasion, for the benefit of the people of God in all ages.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/55-12.htm">Isaiah 55:12</a></div><div class="verse">For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap <i>their</i> hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with</span> <span class="cmt_word">peace</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3-6, 19-21</a>, etc.). A strong contrast is frequently drawn between the exodus from Babylon and that from Egypt. On the former occasion all was hurry, alarm, disquiet, danger. The later exodus will be accompanied with "peace" and "joy" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9 - 16</a>, etc.).

There was much of the Law which it was impossible to observe during the Captivity. Sacrifice had ceased, the temple was destroyed, almost all the ceremonial law must have been suspended; even the command to do no work on the sabbath day cannot have been kept by a nation of slaves, whose masters would certainly not have permitted them to be idle one day in seven. Still, the spirit of the ordinance might be kept by devoting the day, so far as was possible, to religious observance, as to prayer and to meditation upon holy things. This is now enjoined on the captive Jews, with the promise of a blessing - a blessing in which even the most despised part of the nation, the proselytes and the eunuchs, might participate. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Keep ye judgment, and do justice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">keep ye Law</span>, <span class="accented">and observe righteousness.</span> The exhortation is general, and has no special bearing on trials or law-courts. It is a call on the Jews, in their captivity, to keep, so far as was possible, the whole Law given on Sinai. My salvation is near to come. The nearer the time of deliverance approaches, the more faithful and exact ought Israel to be in life and conduct. God's "salvation" and his "righteousness" go hand-in-hand. It is as his righteous people, "a holy seed" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>), that he is about to vindicate and rescue them. If they are no holier than others, why should he do more for them than for those others? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>is</i> the man <i>that</i> doeth this, and the son of man <i>that</i> layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That doeth this...  that layeth hold on it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that doeth according to the exhortation in ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">That keepeth the sabbath</span>. The prominent place assigned to this duty by the evangelical prophet is remarkable. We may observe, however, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the spirit of obedience is better tested by a positive than by a moral ordinance; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that as, probably, there could be little outward keeping of the sabbath by the captives, it would have had to be kept inwardly by spiritual exercises, by silent prayer and praise, together with prolonged meditation upon holy things. In the absence of all the ordinary aids to devotion, the religious condition of the people must have depended very much on their keeping up the recollection of the sabbath, and hallowing it so far as was possible; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> doing no work for themselves, neither buying nor selling, making their devotions longer, and keeping God in their thoughts throughout the day.

During the depression of the Captivity these are not likely to have been many. Still, there were doubtless some; and these, who had embraced Judaism under such unfavourable circumstances, were entitled to special consideration. As Messianic hopes prevailed, and the time of restoration to Palestine drew near (ver. 1), they might naturally be afraid that they would not be looked upon as equals by the native Israelites, but would be made into a lower grade, if not even excluded. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath utterly separated me</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord will utterly separate me.</span> They do not suppose it done, but think it will be done. <span class="cmt_word">The eunuch</span>. Isaiah had prophesied to Hezekiah that a certain number of his seed should serve as eunuchs in the royal   palace of the King of Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-18.htm">2 Kings 20:18</a>). Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were such persons (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3-6</a>), and there may have been others. By the letter of the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>), they were cut off from the congregation, but practically it would seem that during the Captivity they were on a par with other Israelites. These persons feared, with more reason than the foreign proselytes, that, on the return of Israel to their own land, a stricter practice would be established than had prevailed during the Captivity, and the letter of the Law would be enforced against them. I am a dry tree. Therefore useless, and entitled to no consideration at all.

And no doubt it was used for the purpose of prayer, as well as for the purpose of sacrifice, from its first erection to its final destruction. But the purpose of sacrifice so far predominated, in fact, over the other, that the expression, "my house of prayer," comes upon us in this place to some extent as a surprise. The prophet seems to anticipate the time when the temple should be emphatically a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> the legal sacrifices having received their fulfilment (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>), and being thenceforth superfluous and out of place.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-8.htm">Isaiah 56:8</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather <i>others</i> to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Lord Jehovah - Adonai Jehovah.</span> An unusual phrase. <span class="cmt_word">Which gathereth together the outcasts of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Lord who has pledged himself to bring back Israel from captivity, and to gather together Israel's outcasts from all regions (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-5.htm">Isaiah 43:5, 6</a>, etc.). This same Lord now promises something further: "He will gather others also to Israel, besides his own gathered ones." Introduced with such emphasis and formality, this was probably, when delivered, a new revelation. In the present arrangement of the prophecies, however, it announces no novelty. The addition of Gentile members to the Israelite community has been declared frequently (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a>, etc.). Section V. A WARNING TO THE WICKED (ISAIH 56:9-57.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a></div><div class="verse">All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, <i>yea</i>, all ye beasts in the forest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - THE BLIND GUIDES OF ISRAEL REBUKED. A sudden change of style marks the introduction of an entirely new prophecy. The eye of the prophet, apparently, goes back from the period of the exile, which he has been so long contemplating, to his own day, or at any rate to the pre-exile period, and rests upon Israel in their own land. He sees them misled by their teachers (vers. 10-12), given to idolatry (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-3.htm">Isaiah 57:3-9</a>), and offering themselves a ready prey to their enemies (<a href="../../par/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>). Many modern critics regard the passage as the composition of an unknown prophet belonging to the time of Manasseh. But there is no sufficient evidence of this. The prophecy has many Isaiah characteristics. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beasts of the field...  beasts in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the forest;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all wild beasts of whatever kind" - all the enemies of God's flock (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-9.htm">Jeremiah 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Come to devour.</span> Make haste, now is your opportunity. The people have none to protect them, and will be an easy prey. Come, set to work; devour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a></div><div class="verse">His watchmen <i>are</i> blind: they are all ignorant, they <i>are</i> all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His watchmen are blind</span>. Israel's "watchmen" are his guides and teachers, the prophets (Isaiah 6:17; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, etc.). At the time of which Isaiah speaks, they are "blind" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7, 16, 18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-8.htm">Isaiah 43:8</a>, etc.), or without knowledge - like the "blind guides" of the Gospel (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-39.htm">Luke 6:39</a>, etc.). They have not the spiritual discernment which would enable them to lead the people aright. <span class="cmt_word">Further, they are dumb dogs.</span> Instead of acting as faithful watch-dogs, who give warning of the approach of danger by   their barking, they remain apathetic, and utter no warning at all. It is as if they passed their lives in sleep. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-11.htm">Isaiah 56:11</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, <i>they are</i> greedy dogs <i>which</i> can never have enough, and they <i>are</i> shepherds <i>that</i> cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they are greedy dogs</span>. Another defect is noted. Not only do they fail in the way of neglect of duty, but they are actively culpable. Being worldly and not spiritually minded, they are "greedy" after gain. Anciently, the taking of a gift, or fee, from those who came to consult them was regarded as no dishonour to the prophetic office (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>); but the nobler class of prophets declined to make a profit of their spiritual powers, and would receive no fee (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-20.htm">Acts 8:20</a>). In Ezekiel and Micah the taking of gifts by prophets is regarded as discreditable (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>). From his quarter; rather, <span class="accented">to the uttermost</span> (Kay), or <span class="accented">every one</span>, <span class="accented">without exception</span> (Cheyne). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/56-12.htm">Isaiah 56:12</a></div><div class="verse">Come ye, <i>say they</i>, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, <i>and</i> much more abundant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine</span>. Here we have mention of a third defect. The prophets of the time are not only negligent of their duty, and covetous, but they are given to excess in wine and to long revels, such as even the heathen considered to be disgraceful (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-7.htm">Isaiah 28:7</a>, where both priests and prophets are taxed with habitual drunkenness).

And God sometimes removed the righteous from earth by a natural death before they had grown old (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>).

The reference is, as Mr. Cheyne says, to the "orgiastic cults' in the sacred groves of Palestinian heathenism." The nature of these cults is well stated by Professor Dollinger ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. p. 430): "At the spring festival, called by some the 'brand-feast,' by others that of torches, which was attended by streams of visitors from every country, huge trees were burnt, with the offerings suspended on them. Even children were sacrificed; they were put into a leathern bag, and thrown the whole height of the temple to the bottom, with the shocking expression that they were calves, and not children. In the fore-court stood two gigantic phalli. To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement; and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose<span class="cmt_word">." Slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks.</span> The sacrifice of their children to Moloch was largely practised by the Jews in the later period of the kingdom of Judah. It seems to have been originally introduced by the superstitious Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, who "made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>). Suspended during the reign of Hezekiah, it was renewed under Manasseh, who followed the example of his grandfather in himself sacrificing one of his sons (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Under the last three kings it prevailed to a very wide extent, and the prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel are loud in their denunciations of it (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-2.htm">Jeremiah 19:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37</a>, etc.). Arguments have been brought forward to prove that the child was merely passed before a fire, or between two fires, and not burnt; but the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming (see the article on "Moloch" in Dr. W. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 2, pp. 403, 404). The rite belonged especially to the worship of Chemosh and Moloch by the Moabites and Ammonites (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>), from whom it was adopted by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7</a>) and Jews. The sacrifice was supposed to be expiatory (<a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). In the later times of the Jewish kingdom the place of sacrifice was the valley of Hinnom, west and north of Jerusalem, which is overhung by rugged rocks.

But, in the first place, there is no evidence that anciently these passages were understood literally, or that such inscriptions were ever set up; and secondly, as Mr. Cheyne remarks, they would have been more, rather than less, conspicuous in a new place. Probably, therefore, the "memorial" (<span class="accented">zikkaron</span>) of this place is some idolatrous symbol or emblem newly adopted by the Jews, and made use of as a sort of talisman.

It is a feature of the idolatry of the time, that it was a mixture adopted from many quarters. It included Baal and Ashtoreth-worship from Phoenicia, Moloch-worship from Moab and Ammos, worship of the Queen of Heaven from Syria, high-place worship from the Canaanites, and stone-worship from their own remote Mesopotamian ancestors. And made thee a covenant with them; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "a bargain for wages," that aid and protection should be rendered in return for worship and sacrifice. <span class="cmt_word">Where thou sawest it</span>.

Moreover, the King of <span class="accented">Assyria is</span> never called simply" the king." It is, therefore, better to regard "the king" as Moloch, whom the Jews of Isaiah's time certainly worshipped (see ver. 5), and whose name was a mere dialectic variety of <span class="accented">Melech</span>, "<span class="accented">king"</span> (see Dean Payne Smith's ' Sermons on Isaiah,' sermon 4. p. 119). <span class="cmt_word">Ointment...  perfumes</span>.

Among the sins that angered God most against the Jews of the later kingdom of Judah was their covetousness - that desire of unjust gain which led them continually to oppress their weaker brethren, to remove their neighbours' landmarks, to harass them with lawsuits, to obtain from the courts corrupt judgments against them, and so to strip them of their inheritances (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15-23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-31.htm">Ezekiel 33:31</a>, etc.).

The whole Law seems to be in force, and the People to make a show of keeping it, and to complain that they are not properly rewarded for their religiousness.

We have there exactly the same representation of a people honouring God with their lips, but whose hearts are far from him - zealous in all the outward forms of religion, even making "many prayers" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>), but yet altogether an offence to God. They are not conscious hypocrites - quite the reverse; they are bent on "doing righteousness," on not forsaking God's ordinance, on continually "approaching" him; but they are wholly without a proper sense of what religion is - they make it a matter of outward observance, and do not understand that it consists in the devotion of the heart. <span class="cmt_word">That did righteousness,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and forsook not</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that hath done righteousness</span>, <span class="accented">and hath not forsaken.</span> The righteousness is, of course, forensic legal righteousness-the offering of the appointed sacrifices, the abstaining from unclean meats, the avoidance of external defilement, the payment of vows, the observance of the one appointed fast, and the like. They ask of me the ordinances of justice. Either "they claim at God's hands righteous judgments on their enemies" (Delitzsch); or "they demand of God a fidelity to his covenant engagements correspondent to their own (assumed) fidelity to theirs." They take delight in approaching to God. So the LXX., the Vulgate, Calvin, Vitringa, and Kay.

Other fasts were from time to time appointed by civil or ecclesiastical authority (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9, 12</a>:<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12, 15</a>); but they were rare, and do not seem to be here intended. Still, the lesson is general, and would apply to all occasions of fasting. The Jews of the time expected, it would seem, some special definite result, in the way of victory or relief, to follow from their observance of the Atonement fast. As it did not follow, they regarded themselves as ill used, and accordingly made complaint. Their feelings approached to those of the Vedic worshippers, who regarded their religious observances as "not merely pleasing. the god who was the object of them, but as laying him under a binding obligation, and almost compelling him to grant the requests of the worshipper" ('Religions of the Ancient World,' pp. 143, 144). Afflicted our soul These are the exact words of <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29, 31</a>, by which the fast of the great Day of Atonement was instituted. <span class="cmt_word">And thou takest no knowledge</span>; rather, <span class="accented">no notice. <span class="cmt_word"></span>In the day of your fast ye find pleasure</span>. Delitzsch and Mr. Cheyne render, "ye carry on business," which accords better with the clause which follows. The great Day of Atonement was, like the sabbath, a day on which no work was to be done   (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>). The Jews, while priding themselves on their observance of the day, did not really observe it in this particular. <span class="cmt_word">And exact all your labours</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "require of your servants and subordinates all the services that they have to render on other days." Days of religious observance, even under the Law, were always intended to be days of kindly forbearance towards the poor, of the remission of burdens, or even of the actual giving of relief.

Delitzsch explains, "When fasting, they are doubly irritable and ill tempered; and this leads to quarrelling and strife, even to striking with angry fists." This is quite a possible explanation. Or there may have been two parties, one for, the other against, fasting; and those who practised fasting may have done it, as some preached Christ, "of envy and strife" (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>) - to provoke the opposite side. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "ye must not fast as ye do at present, if ye would have your voices heard in heaven."

Is afflicting one's soul simply bowing down one's head as a bulrush, and making one's couch on sackcloth and ashes? Surely it is much more than this.

Such homilies are found in the uninspired Jewish writings ('Taanith,' 2:1; 'Nedarim babli,' p. 10, a, etc.), and are conceived very much in the same spirit.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a></div><div class="verse">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, <i>from</i> doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking <i>thine own</i> words:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - A STRICT OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH ENJOINED. While the fasting of the day only required to be spiritualized, the sabbath observance needed both spiritualizing and increased strictness. From <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a> we learn that the   sabbatical years had been little observed during the later Jewish kingdom; and it would Seem from the present passage (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) that even the observance of the sabbath itself had been neglected. Not that the neglect was total. The sacrifices proper to the sabbath were duly offered - the "solemn assembly" was duly called and attended (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>); but during the rest of the day business flowed in its usual course - the complete sanctification of the entire day was set aside. We find a similar laxity prevalent after the return from the Captivity (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> treat it with reverence, as if it were "holy ground" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-27.htm">Proverbs 4:27</a>). From doing thy pleasure; rather, <span class="accented">from doing thy business -</span> the same expression as in ver. 3. It is by "business," not by pleasure, that the sabbath was polluted both in the time of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-23</a>) and of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>, etc.). And call the sabbath a delight. This is the spiritualization of the sabbath - "to call" and feel it "a delight," a real satisfaction to the soul, not a weariness (<a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>), as it was to many. And shalt honour him; rather, <span class="accented">and shalt honour it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, which is made masculine here, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2</a>. The sabbath was to be honoured by men not pursuing their own ordinary ways, or engaging in their regular business, or even carrying on their ordinary everyday talk. Literally, the command is, not to "speak words;" but no Jews were ever such strict sabbatarians as to understand this as prohibiting <span class="accented">all</span> speech on the sabbath. Some have held that sabbatical talk should be scanty, limited, restrained as much as possible; but even for this there is no warrant. It is the quality, rather than the quantity, of the words uttered that is of real importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/58-14.htm">Isaiah 58:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord</span>. Then shall communion with Jehovah become a real pleasure to thee. The acts of worship shall not be done merely from a sense of duty, because commanded, but because they are congenial to the soul of the worshipper. A right use of the sabbath will help to form in men habits of devotion, which will make religion a joy and a delight to them. <span class="cmt_word">I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "I will give thee a prominent position in the earth, and cause thee to occupy its high places, and hear rule over many nations."

The world itself was the "heritage of Jacob," since in him and his seed "all the families of the earth were to be blessed" (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>). Israel, having laid aside its formalism, and turned to God sincerely. keeping fast and sabbath as God would have them kept, not in the letter, but in the spirit, would enter upon the promised heritage, and occupy the position originally assigned to it. Israel's rejection of the gospel made the mixed Christian Church the inheritress of the old promises. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/57.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 57"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 57" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/59.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 59"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 59" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/59.htm"><title>Isaiah 59 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/59.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/59.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/59-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/58.htm" title="Isaiah 58">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 59 <a href="../isaiah/60.htm" title="Isaiah 60">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - A GENERAL REBUKE OF ISRAEL FOR ITS MANIFOLD SINS, The command given to the prophet in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-1.htm">Isaiah 58:1</a> to "show God's people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins " - partly executed in <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-4.htm">Isaiah 58:4-7</a> and 13 - is now further carried out by a scathing denunciation of various forms of wickedness, more or less prevalent in Israel, the effect of which has been to separate between Israel and God, to "shorten God's hand" and "make his ears heavy."

Truth itself is altogether gone, is missing, not forthcoming. "Tetras Astraea reliquit." This is the worst of all. For truth is the basis of the social fabric, the groundwork of all morality. Once let there be no regard for truth in a state, no discredit attaching to lying, and all virtue is undermined, all soundness is vanished - nothing remains but "wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a><span class="cmt_word">). He that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey</span>. Evil-doers prosper. The man who "eschews evil," and declines to employ (as others do) the weapons of fraud and violence, simply gives himself over as a prey to those who are less scrupulous than himself. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-21.</span> - A PROMISE OF DELIVERANCE. TO OPPRESSED ISRAEL. The godly in Israel were suffering a double oppression: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> at the hand of their ungodly brethren; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> at the hand of the heathen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prophet promises a deliverance from both. The deliverance will be followed by the establishment of Messiah's kingdom, which will continue for ever. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord saw it</span>. The division of the verses here requires alteration. The opening clause of ver. 15 belongs to what precedes; the second clause to what follows. "The Lord saw" that condition of things in Israel which is described in vers. 3-15; and it displeased him; literally, <span class="accented">it was evil in his eyes</span>, especially in that there was no judgment. Justice was not done between man and man; no one thought of pronouncing just judgments. The circumstances were such as to invite a Divine interposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/59-16.htm">Isaiah 59:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he saw that <i>there was</i> no man, and wondered that <i>there was</i> no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it sustained him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God looked for some champion of the oppressed to arise; it was to be expected under the circumstances. But, alas! "there was no man." None stood up to resist the unrighteous and protect the innocent; much less did any stand up to deliver Israel from its heathen adversaries. When it is said that God "<span class="accented">wondered"</span> at no champion appearing, we must understand the expression as an anthropomorphism&middot; <span class="cmt_word">Therefore his arm brought salvation unto him</span>. As them was no human champion, it became necessary that God should arise in his own Person, and show himself. "His arm" and "his righteousness" were enough; no human aid was needed, or could have added anything to the resistless strength of his might (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-5.htm">Isaiah 63:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a></div><div class="verse">For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance <i>for</i> clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He put on righteousness as a breastplate</span>. The Isaiah anthropomorphism is far less gross than the Homeric. The gods in Homer put on actual armour, and take sword and shield. Jehovah arms himself for the battle in a way that is manifestly metaphoric. He puts on a "Divine panoply"  - righteousness as his breastplate, salvation as his helmet, vengeance for garments, and zeal, or jealousy, for a cloak. He takes no offensive weapons - "the out-breathing of his Spirit (ver. 19) is enough" (Kay).

The ordinary future here, and in the remainder of the prophecy, replaces the "perfect of prophetic certitude," which has been employed in   vers. 16, 17. <span class="cmt_word">Fury to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies</span>. God's "adversaries" are those of his own household - his people, the ungodly Israelites; his "enemies" are the heathen that oppress his people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, which is very similar). <span class="cmt_word">To the islands</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the maritime lands, which, under Assyria, and afterwards under Babylon, took part in the oppression of his people.

As usual, the prophet does not note, or perhaps see, intervals of time, but blends events of various periods into one glorious vision of triumphant deliverance, redemption, and prolonged spiritual life in the Redeemer's kingdom.

My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - ISRAEL REBUKED BY THE PARABLE OF A VINEYARD. This chapter stands in a certain sense alone, neither closely connected with what precedes nor with what follows, excepting that it breathes throughout a tone of denunciation. There is also a want of connection between its parts, the allegory of the first section being succeeded by a series of rebukes for sins, expressed in the plainest language, and the rebukes being followed by a threat of punishment, also expressed with plainness. The resemblance of the parable with which the chapter opens to one of those delivered by our Lord, and recorded in the three synoptic Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33-41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-1.htm">Mark 12:1-9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-9.htm">Luke 20:9-16</a>), has been frequently noticed. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now will I sing to my Well-beloved.</span> The prophet sings to Jehovah a song concerning his vineyard. The song consists of eight lines, beginning with "My Well-beloved," and ending with "wild grapes." It is in a lively, dancing measure, very unlike the general style of Isaiah's poetry. The name "Well-beloved" seems to be taken by the prophet from the Song of Songs, where it occurs above twenty times. It well expresses the feeling of a loving soul towards its Creator and Redeemer. <span class="cmt_word">A song of my Well-beloved.</span> Bishop Lowth translates "A song of loves," and Mr. Cheyne "A love-song;" but this requires an alteration of the text, and is unsatisfactory from the fact that the song which follows is <span class="accented">not</span> a "love-song." May we not understand the words to mean "a song concerning my Well-beloved in respect of his vineyard?" <span class="cmt_word">Touching his vineyard</span>. Israel is compared to a "vine" in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>), and the Church of God to a "garden" in Canticles (<a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-1.htm">Song of Solomon 5:1</a>); perhaps also to a "vineyard" in the same book (<a href="../../par/songs/8-12.htm">Song of Solomon 8:12</a>). Isaiah may have had this last passage in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">My Beloved hath a vineyard</span>; rather, <span class="accented">had a vineyard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>, LXX.). <span class="cmt_word">In a very fruitful hill</span>. So the passage is generally understood, since <span class="accented">keren</span>, horn, is used for a height by the Arabs (as also by the Germans, e.g. Matterhorn, Wetterhorn, Aarhorn, etc.), and "son of oil" is a not unlikely Orientalism for "rich" or "fruitful." With the "hill" of this passage compare the "mountain" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, both passages indicating that the Church of God is set on aft eminence, and "cannot be hid" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-14.htm">Matthew 5:14</a>).

The word occurs only in this place, and has no cognates in Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">And gathered out the stones</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-10.htm">Isaiah 62:10</a>). In the stony soil of Palestine, to collect the surface stones into heaps, or build them into walls, is of primary necessity for the improvement of the land. Conversely the stones were put back, and scattered over the land, by those who wished to "mar" it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Planted it with the choicest vine</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>). The <span class="accented">sorek</span> seems to have been a particular kind of vine, reckoned superior to others. The etymology of the word indicates that it was of a deep red color. <span class="cmt_word">Built a tower</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>). Towers had to be built in gardens, orchards, and vineyards, that watch might be kept from them against thieves and marauders (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-8.htm">1 Kings 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27-4.htm">2 Chronicles 27:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Made a wine-press</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dug a winepress</span>. The excavation was made to contain a vat, above which was the "press," worked by men, who wrung the liquor out of a great bag containing the grapes.

Compare Nathan's appeal to David by the parable of the ewe lamb (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-4</a>).

The address is still smooth and persuasive up to the word "vineyard." Then there is a sudden change; the style becomes abrupt, the tone fierce and menacing. "Let me tell you what I will do to my vineyard: break down its hedge, that it be grazed on; destroy its wall, that it be trampled underfoot," etc. <span class="cmt_word">The hedge... the wall</span>. Vine-yards were usually protected either by a hedge of thorns, commonly of the prickly pear, or else by a wall; but the rabbis say that in some cases, for additional security, they were surrounded by both. God had given his vineyard all the protection possible.

Active ravage is not so much pointed at, as the desolation which comes from neglect. <span class="cmt_word">There shall come up briers and thorns.</span> The natural produce of neglected ground in Palestine (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>). The "thorns and briers" symbolize vices of various kinds, the natural produce of the human soul, if God leaves it to itself. The words are scarcely to be taken literally, though it is probably true that "no country in the world has such variety and abundance of thorny plants as Palestine in its present desolation" (Macmillan, 'Min. of Nat.,' p. 103). <span class="cmt_word">I will also command the clouds</span>. Here at last disguise is thrown off, and the speaker manifestly appears as Jehovah, who can alone "command the clouds." The "rain" intended is probably that of his gracious influences.

After the general warning conveyed to Israel by the parable of the vineyard, six sins are particularized as those which have especially provoked God to give the warning. On each of these woe is denounced. Two have special punishments assigned to them (vers. 8-17); the remainder are joined in one general threat of retribution (vers. 18  - 24). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto them that join house to house</span>. This is <span class="accented">the first woe</span>. It is pronounced on the greed which leads men to continually enlarge their estates, without regard to their neighbors' convenience. Nothing is said of any use of unfair means, much <span class="accented">less</span> of violence in dispossessing the former proprietors. What is denounced is the selfishness of vast accumulations of land in single bands, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Jewish law was peculiarly inimical to this practice (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>); but perhaps it is not without reason that many writers of our own time object to it on general grounds. <span class="cmt_word">Till there be no place</span>; literally, <span class="accented">till want of place</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till there is no room for others. A hyperbole, doubtless, but marking a real national inconvenience. That they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth; rather, <span class="accented">that ye may dwell by yourselves in the midst of the land</span>. The great landlords wished to isolate themselves; they disliked neighbors; they would fain "dwell by themselves," without neighbors to trouble them. Uzziah seems, by what is said of his possessions (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>), to have been one of the greatest sinners in respect of the accumulation of land.

Two kinds of intoxicating liquor seem to have been consumed at these banquets, viz. ordinary grape wine, and a much stronger drink, which is said to have been "made of dates, pomegranates, apples, honey, barley, and other ingredients," which was known as <span class="accented">shekar</span> (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), and is called "strong drink" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Till wine inflame them</span>; or, <span class="accented">the wine inflaming them</span>.

It is difficult to identify the Hebrew instruments of music with modern names; but there seems to be no doubt that the <span class="accented">kinnor</span> was a sort of harp, and the <span class="accented">khalib</span> a sort of pipe. The <span class="accented">nebel</span>, generally rendered by "psaltery," but here and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a> by "viol," was a stringed instrument played with the fingers (Josephus); perhaps a lyre, perhaps a sort of dulcimer. The <span class="accented">toph</span>, here translated "tabret," and elsewhere often "timbrel,"  was most likely a tambourine. All four instruments had in the earlier times been dedicated to the worship of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>); now they were employed to inflame men's passions at feasts. <span class="cmt_word">They regard not the work of the Lord</span>. The "work of Jehovah" is his manifestation of himself in history, more especially in the history of his chosen people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-4.htm">Psalm 92:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-3.htm">Psalm 111:3</a>, etc.).

"Are gone" or "have gone" is "the perfect of prophetic certainty" (Cheyne). The prophet sees the captivity as a thing that had already taken place. It as an appropriate punishment for drunkenness and revelry to be carried off into servitude, and in that condition to suffer, as slaves so often did, hunger and thirst. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have no knowledge</span>; or, <span class="accented">unawares</span>, <span class="accented">without foreseeing it</span> (so Rosenm&uuml;ller, Gesenius, Ewald, Delitzsch, Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Their honorable men</span>; literally, <span class="accented">their glory</span>, for "their glorious ones" - the abstract for the concrete. <span class="cmt_word">Are famished</span>; literally, <span class="accented">sons of famine</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "starvelings." <span class="cmt_word">Their multitude</span>; or, <span class="accented">their noisy crowd</span> (Kay) - the "throng of voluptuaries" who frequented the great banquets of vers. 11, 12.

Dr. Kay takes the "lambs" to be the remnant of Israel that survived the judgment, who will feed freely, cared for by the good Shepherd; but the parallelism so generally affected by Isaiah seems to require a meaning more consonant with the later clause of the verse. Most commentators, therefore, expound the passage literally, "Then shall lambs feed [on the desolated estates of the covetous]" (see vers. 8-10). <span class="cmt_word">After their manner</span>; or, <span class="accented">after their own guidance</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at their pleasure, as they list (so Lowth and Rosenm&uuml;ller). <span class="cmt_word">And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</span> <span class="accented">Goim</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> nomad tribes, shall consume the produce of the wasted fields once possessed by the Hebrew grandees. Ewald proposes to make the verse immediately follow ver. 10; but this is not necessary. The occupation of their lands by wandering tribes, Arabs and others, was a part of the punishment that fell on all the nobles, not on those only who accumulated large estates.

There are persons who gloss over evil deeds and evil habits by fair-sounding names, who call cowardice caution, and rashness courage,  niggardliness thrift, and wasteful profusion generosity. The same men are apt also to call good evil; they brand prudence with the name of cunning, call meekness want of proper spirit, sincerity rudeness, and firmness obstinacy. This deadness to moral distinctions is the sign of deep moral corruption, and fully deserves to have a special "woe" pronounced against it. <span class="cmt_word">That put darkness for light</span>. "Light" and "darkness" symbolize good and evil throughout Scripture (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-29.htm">2 Samuel 22:29</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-3.htm">Job 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/112-4.htm">Psalm 112:4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-13.htm">Proverbs 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-22.htm">Matthew 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-19.htm">John 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, etc.). They are sometimes mere synonyms, as here; but sometimes they express rather the intellectual side of morality. <span class="cmt_word">Bitter for sweet</span>. More symbolism, but of a rarer kind. Jeremiah calls wickedness "bitter" (Jeremiah 2:9; 4:18), and the psalmist calls the judgments of God" sweet" (Psalm 109:103). But the terms are not often used with any moral bearing.

Self-conceit is the antithesis of humility; and as humility is, in a certain sense, the crowning virtue, so self-conceit is a sort of finishing touch put to vice.

It is expressed by a mixed metaphor, or "combination of two figures," the former taken from the burning of stubble and withered grass by the farmer when he is cleaning his fields, the latter from the natural decay of a blossoming plant or tree. In either case the destruction is complete, but in the one it arises from an external force, fire; in the other from an internal failure of vitality. The ruin of Israel would include both; it would be brought about by an internal cause, their corruption, and an external one, God's anger. <span class="cmt_word">As the fire devoureth the stubble</span>; literally, <span class="accented">as a tongue of fire eats up stubble</span>. "<span class="accented">Tongue</span> of fire" is an unusual phrase, occurring in all Scripture only here and in <a href="../../par/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>.

But now for the first time a terrible invasion, in which many nations will participate, is clearly announced. At first the imagery is obscure (ver. 25), but it soon grows more distinct. "Nations" are summoned to the attack; a vast army comes, and comes" with speed swiftly" (ver. 26); then their array is described (vers. 27, 28); and finally their ravin is compared to that of lions, and their success in catching and carrying off their prey is prophesied (ver. 29). In the last verse of the chapter the prophet falls back into vaguer imagery, comparing the roar of the invaders to the roaring of the sea, and the desolated land to one seen under the gloom of a preternatural darkness (ver. 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The threats of this verse are all vague and general, for there is no reason to suppose that the phrase," the hills did tremble, "refers to an actual earthquake.

A "trembling of the hills" is, in prophetic language, a commotion among the chief men of the land. <span class="cmt_word">He hath stretched forth his hand.</span> Again the "perfect of prophetic certitude." <span class="cmt_word">Their carcasses were torn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">were as refuse</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-45.htm">Lamentations 3:45</a>).

The words imply that God's judgment upon Judah will not be a single stroke, but a continuous smiting, covering some considerable space of time.

But "ensigns" or "standards" were in use both among the Egyptians (Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 121.) and among the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 461) before the time of Isaiah, and are, therefore, likely to have been in use among the Hebrews.

God lifts up his standard to draw the nations together, indicating thereby that they are to fight his battles. <span class="cmt_word">And will hiss</span>. "Hissing" is said to have been practiced by bee-keepers to draw their bees out of the hives in the morning, and bring them home again from the fields at nightfall (Cyril, <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.).

The spiritual meaning is that graces of all kinds shall abound in and around the holy city, and shall make it beautiful and glorious. <span class="cmt_word">The fir tree, the pine</span> <span class="cmt_word">tree, and the box together</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a>, where the same words occur in the same order; and, for the trees intended, see the comment on that passage). <span class="cmt_word">To</span> <span class="cmt_word">beautify the place of my sanctuary</span>. Not with "avenues of cedars and plane trees leading up to it" (Delitzsch), which was a style of ornamentation quite unknown to the lie-brews; but with groves, and thickets, and sylvan glades, and wooded slopes all around it, as round the Syrian temples in the Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The place of my feet</span>. The Jewish temple, as the special place of God's presence upon earth, was frequently termed "God's footstool" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>). He that towers above the heavens had there set his foot. The metaphor is transferred to the renovated Zion.

Zion has been a wife repudiated for her adulteries, "forsaken" by her husband, and the object of his just "hate." So that no man went through thee. The mixed metaphor is awkward, but readily intelligible. Zion is at once a city and a wife. As a wife, she is "hated and forsaken," as a city, no man goes through her. An eternal excellency (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>, and see the Homiletics on the passage).

The general idea is that the glorious age of Solomon would return (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21, 27</a>), and Zion be as resplendent and as wealthy as in his time. The material splendour is, no doubt, throughout the whole description, typical in the main of spiritual glories and excellences. I will also make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness. "Peace" and "righteousness" are here personified; and the declaration is that they shall bear rule in the community whereof the prophet is speaking (comp, <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-16.htm">Isaiah 32:16, 17</a>).

The entire cessation of war and violence is one of the most characteristic features of the "last times," when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares, and spears into pruning-hooks. "The Prince of Peace" shall ultimately establish peace. It is not surprising that men of earnest religious feeling should have thought, at various times, that they saw the actual commencement of the reign of peace upon earth, so distinctly promised, so earnestly longed for, so necessary for the happiness of mankind. But to a calm and dispassionate observer the nineteenth century seems scarcely more advanced upon the road which leads to this desirable end than the first. Thou shall call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates Praise. The true wall of the city will be the "salvation" of which God assures it, and the true gates will be the "praise," or renown, which it has among the nations of the earth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-1.htm">Isaiah 26:1</a>).

Here Isaiah anticipates one of the most sublime thoughts in the Revelation of St. John the Divine, viz. that the heavenly Jerusalem, illuminated perpetually by the radiance of the Divine Presence, shall need neither light of the sun by day, nor of the moon by night, but shall be sufficiently illumined by the direct and primary light which streams down upon it from God himself. Whether the sun and moon will continue to exist or not is beyond the prophet's ken - he makes no announcement on the subject; sufficient for him that the redeemed bask perpetually in a Divine radiance shed upon them by the "Father of lights" (see <a href="../../par/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>). The germ of the idea appears in the earlier prophecies (<a href="../../par/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For brightness</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">illumination. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light</span>. God is "the Father of lights" (<a href="../../par/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>) - "the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." (<a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). All other light is but his shadow and his  reflex - his creature (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>) - therefore perishable, not to be reckoned on for continuance (<a href="../../par/psalms/102-26.htm">Psalm 102:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>).

God will not only be the Light of the Church, but her "Glory" and boast. As the Shechinah was the glory of the first, so "the eternal unchangeable light of Jehovah, with its peaceful gentleness and perfect purity" (Delitzsch), will be the glory of the final temple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/60-20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a></div><div class="verse">Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy sun...  thy moon</span>.

Till the new Jerusalem descends from heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>), and Christ reigns personally over his people (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>), the Church is always, more or less, in a state of mourning. The Bridegroom is away (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>); his light shines upon his Church only by snatches; his Church feels itself unworthy of him - cold, unloving, stained with sin. Fasting, weeping, and mourning befit such a state of things. But in the final condition of the redeemed their mourning shall be ended, "sorrow and sighing shall have fled away" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/35-10.htm">Isaiah 35:10</a>); God shall have "wiped away all tears from their eyes" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "There shall be no more death" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>); "no more curse" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-3.htm">Revelation 22:3</a>); "neither sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).

The words of our Lord in <a href="../../par/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a>, "This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears," preclude the application of this passage to any other than the Lord himself. It is simply astonishing that some Christian commentators (Ewald, Hitzig, Knobel) have not seen the force of this argument, but, with the Jews, imagine the prophet to be speaking of his own ministry. It is contrary to the entire spirit of Isaiah's writings so to glorify himself, and specially unsuitable that, after having brought forward with such emphasis the Person of "the Servant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1-12</a>), he should proceed to take his place, and to "ascribe to himself those very same official attributes which he has already set forth as characteristic features in his portrait of the predicted One" (Delitzsch). Hence most recent commentators, whatever their school of thought, have acquiesced in the patristic interpretation, which regarded the Servant of Jehovah as here speaking of himself. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the Spirit of the Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>) <span class="accented">is upon me.</span> The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and one manuscript omit <span class="accented">adonai.</span> In the original announcement of "the Servant" it was stated that God had "put his Spirit upon him" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>).

To proclaim liberty to the captives. This was one of the special offices of "the Servant" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>).

An "acceptable year," or "year of acceptance," is a space of time during which God would be pleased to accept such as repented and turned to him.

Having proclaimed the objects of his own mission, "the Servant" proceeds to declare God's gracious purposes towards Israel. Taking the Captivity period for his standpoint, he promises, first, the restoration of the cities of Judah (ver. 4), and then a flourishing time in which Jews and Gentiles shall dwell together in one community peacefully and gloriously, Israel having a certain pre-eminence (vers. 5-9). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the old wastes.</span> (On the "waste" condition, not of Jerusalem only, but of the cities of Judith generally, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-26.htm">Isaiah 44:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a>, etc.) The first step in the recovery of Israel from the misery of the Captivity would be a return to Palestine, and a general restoration of the ruined towns. It was a ruin of "many generations," having commenced, probably, with the invasion of Pharaoh-Necho in  <span class="date">B.C. 608</span>, and being continued till the edict of Cyrus ( <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>).

The Gentiles who join themselves with the Jews, and form with them one community, are constantly represented in the writings of Isaiah as occupying a subordinate position. In the New Testament, Jew and Gentile are put upon a par. Is the explanation that Isaiah assumes that the Jews generally will accept the gospel, and therefore, to some extent, retain their privileges in the new community, whereas, in fact, they rejected the gospel, and so lost their natural position (see <a href="../../par/romans/11-7.htm">Romans 11:7-20</a>)? Or does Isaiah look onward to a later date? And is there to be a restoration of "Israel according to the flesh" upon their conversion, and a reinstatement of them in a position of privilege? Such a condition of things seems glanced at in <a href="../../par/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-29</a>, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your</span> <span class="cmt_word">vinedressers.</span> Not so much compelled, like the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21-27</a>), to perform menial offices, as undertaking them voluntarily out of good will.

Had they risen to the height of their calling when our Lord and his disciples offered them salvation before offering it to the Gentiles, they might have "been in the midst of the heathen who had entered into the congregation of Jehovah and become the people of God, what the Aaronites farmerly were in the midst of Israel itself" (Delitzsch).

An increase of territory had been already prophesied (<a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18-21</a>) - an increase which, however, was not so much an extension of the bounds of Palestine as a spread of the Church over the whole earth (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-12.htm">Zechariah 9:12</a>).

So the Targum and Rosenmuller. Others think that "the Servant" is still speaking, or that Isaiah speaks in the name of the people. To us the exposition of the Targum appears the most satisfactory. It is in the manner of Isaiah suddenly to introduce a new speaker. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will greatly rejoice in the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a>). The promises made were such as naturally to call forth on the part of Israel the most heartfelt joy and rejoicing - including, as they did, restoration, rule over the Gentiles, a universal priesthood, a wide territory, "everlasting joy," a high renown, and an "everlasting covenant<span class="cmt_word">. He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-17.htm">Isaiah 59:17</a> and Isaiah 61:3). The metaphor occurs also in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/71-6.htm">Psalm 71:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/109-18.htm">Psalm 109:18</a>). God clothes Israel with "righteousness" derived from himself (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>, <span class="accented">ad fin.</span>), and then with its natural consequence - "salvation." The result is to make Israel as a bridegroom who decketh himself with a priestly crown, and as a bride who adornoth herself with her jewels. That bridegrooms ordinarily wore crowns appears from the Mishna. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/61-11.htm">Isaiah 61:11</a></div><div class="verse">For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the garden</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a</span> <span class="accented">garden.</span> The Hebrew is without the article. <span class="cmt_word">Righteousness and praise</span>.

Some regard the speaker in this chapter as Jehovah; some as the prophet, or the prophetical order; some as "the Servant." The last supposition appears to us the simplest and the best. The close connection with the preceding chapter is evident. If that then be, in the main, "a soliloquy of the Servant," this should he a continuation of the soliloquy. Israel is promised "righteousness," "glory," "a new name," a guard of angels, a time of peace and prosperity, deliverance from Babylon, and triumphant establishment in Zion under God's protection. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace</span>. In the past God has kept silence (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-11.htm">Isaiah 57:11</a>). "The Servant" has not caused his voice to be heard. Babylon has been allowed to continue her oppression unchecked. But now there will be a change. God will lift up his voice, and the nations will hear; and the "salvation" of Israel will be effected speedily. For Jerusalem's sake. "Zion" and "Jerusalem" are used throughout as synonyms (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4, 5</a>, and 9; 33:20; 40:9; 41:27; 52:1; 64:10, etc.), like "Israel" and Jacob." Strictly speaking, "Zion" is the mountain, "Jerusalem" the city built upon it. Until the righteousness thereof go forth (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10, 11</a>).

Israel's "salvation" would be made manifest; primarily by her triumphant return from Babylon, and more completely by her position in the final kingdom of the Redeemer.

What the Gentiles are especially to see and admire is Israel's righteousness. This may point to those acknowledgments of the purity and excellence of the early Church which were made by the heathen (Plin., 'Epist.,' 10:97), and which culminated in the saying, "See how these Christians love one another!" The sceptic Gibbon acknowledges, among the causes of the success of Christianity, "the virtues of the early Christians." All kings (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-7.htm">Isaiah 49:7, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-22.htm">Psalm 50:22</a>:11). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called by a new name</span> (comp. vers. 4 and 12; and see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>). It is not altogether clear what the "new name" is, since in the remainder of the present chapter more than one name is suggested. Rosenmuller supposes" Hephzibah" to be meant. Dr. Kay suggests "the holy people," and notes that the title of "holy ones," or "saints," is given by St. Paul to all Christians (<a href="../../par/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>, etc.). Mr. Cheyne thinks that it is some unknown title of honour, akin to that mentioned by Jeremiah "Jehovah our Righteousness" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>). "New names" will be given to individual saints in the heavenly kingdom (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>).

Her enemies, it would seem, had gone so far as to give her the name in derision<span class="cmt_word">. Neither shall thy land ...  be termed Desolate</span>. Judaea had not only been desolated by the Babylonian invaders under Nebucbarlnezzar, but had remained "desolate" during the whole period of the Captivity (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-19.htm">Isaiah 49:19</a>, etc.). It had come to be spoken of as <span class="accented">Sh'marnah</span>, "a desolation" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Jeremiah 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-2.htm">Jeremiah 44:2, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-34.htm">Ezekiel 36:34</a>). Now all should be altered. As Ezekiel prophesied, "The land that was <span class="accented">desolate</span> is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "my delight is in her."

Beulah, or rather Be'ulah, means "married" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-1.htm">Isaiah 54:1</a>). Judaea would be "married" to her sons, or her people, when they quitted Babylon and once more took possession of her. The Hebrew verb toe "to marry" (as a man marries) means literally "to be lord over." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>as</i> a young man marrieth a virgin, <i>so</i> shall thy sons marry thee: and <i>as</i> the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, <i>so</i> shall thy God rejoice over thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride</span>. There is a double employment of the analogy with marriage here. The land, Judaea, personified as a female, is married to her sons, or her people, regarded (in this connection) as a male. The people,   regarded as a female ("the virgin daughter of Zion," <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-22.htm">Isaiah 37:22</a>) is also married to Jehovah, and recognizes him as her Bridegroom (Comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>).

I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - A JUDGMENT ON IDUMAEA. Isaiah had already, in the first portion of his prophecy, announced" a great slaughter in the land of Idumaea" as resolved on in the counsels of God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-10</a>). He now recurs to the subject, and represents Jehovah as a warrior with blood-stained garments, fresh from the field of battle in Edom, where he has trodden down his foes and taken a fierce vengeance on them. The Idumaeans probably represent the world-power; and the "day of vengeance" may be one still future, in which the enemies of God will feel the weight of his hand. The description stands by itself, neither connected with what goes before nor with what follows. It has the appearance of a separate poem, which accident has placed in its present position. In form it is "a lyrico-dramatic dialogue between the prophet as a bystander and a victorious warrior (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehovah) returning from battle in Idumaea" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is this?</span> The prophet opens the dialogue with an inquiry, "Who is it that presents himself before him suddenly in a strange guise?" He comes from <span class="cmt_word">Edom,</span> from <span class="cmt_word">Bozrah</span> - a principal Edomite city (see the comment on Isaiah 34:6) - <span class="cmt_word">with dyed garments</span>; or, rather, <span class="accented">with blood-red garments-garments</span> incarnadined with gore. "Who is this," again he asks, "that is glorious (or, <span class="accented">splendid</span>) in his apparel" - the blood-stained vesture of the conqueror was a glory to him (<a href="../../par/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-13.htm">Revelation 19:13</a>)- "as he travels" (or, "bends forward" ) <span class="cmt_word">in the greatness of his strength</span> - exhibiting in his movements a mighty indomitable strength? Who is it? The reply is immediate - <span class="cmt_word">I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I, whose every word is "holy, just, and true," who alone am able to "save to the uttermost all that come to me" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). The answer unmistakably indicates that the figure which has appeared to the prophet is that of Jehovah.

What means the redness of thine apparel? Whence the stains? Are they wine-stains consequent on treading the winepress? Among the Hebrews, as among the Egyptians (Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 1. p. 46), the juice of the grape was trodden out by the feet of men, who often splashed some upon their garments (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-11.htm">Genesis 49:11</a>).

He accepts the suggestion of the prophet; but metaphorically, not literally. He has indeed been "treading a wine-press," but it is the wine-press of his fury, in which he has trampled down his enemies; and the stains upon his raiment are, consequently, not wine-stains, but stains of blood (comp. <a href="../../par/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/14-19.htm">Revelation 14:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Alone</span>.

The whole is a prophecy of the future; but the dramatic form of the narrative requires that the verbs should be in the past. As "the peoples" would not help God, but took the side of his enemies, they too were placed in the winepress, and crushed under his feet. <span class="cmt_word">Their</span> <span class="cmt_word">blood;</span> literally, <span class="accented">their juice.</span> Lowth and Kay translate, "life-blood;" Delitzsch, "life-sap;" Mr. Cheyne, excellently, "life-stream."

"A day" is time enough for God to take vengeance, to kill, and to destroy. He hastens over work that is necessary, but uncongenial.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/63-7.htm">Isaiah 63:7</a></div><div class="verse">I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, <i>and</i> the praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-14.</span> - GOD PRAISED FOR HIS MERCIES. The address opens with pure and simple thanksgiving of the most general kind, God being praised for his loving-kindness, compassion, and sympathy with his people (vers. 7-9). An historical survey is then commenced, and Israel's shortcomings contrasted with God's mercies, but with a predominantly thankful and even jubilant tone (vers. 10-14). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will mention</span>; or, <span class="accented">celebrate</span>.

Soon afterwards God acknowledged them as "<span class="accented">his</span> people" (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). The exiles probably go back in their thoughts to this time. <span class="cmt_word">Children that will not lie</span>; or, <span class="accented">deal falsely</span>, as the same word is translated in <a href="../../par/psalms/44-17.htm">Psalm 44:17</a>.

It became an intense oppression, when the king "arose who knew not Joseph" (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>). God's sympathy with Israel's sufferings at this time is strongly marked in the narrative of Exodus (<a href="../../par/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7, 17</a>). An alternative reading of the Hebrew text gives the sense, "In all their affliction he was not an adversary;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he did not afflict them for their hurt, but for their benefit. But the reading followed by our translators, and most moderns, is to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">The angel of his presence saved them</span>. "The angel of his presence" occurs nowhere but in this place. It is probably equivalent to "the angel of God" (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/15-6.htm">Judges 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>), or "the angel of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/22-23.htm">Numbers 22:23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-3.htm">Judges 13:3</a>, etc.), and designates either the Second Person of the Trinity, or the highest of the angelic company, who seems to be the archangel Michael (see Pussy's 'Daniel,' pp. 525, 526).

The rebellions of Israel against God commenced in the wilderness. They rebelled at Sinai, when they set up the golden calf; at Meribah (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24</a>); at Shittim, when they consorted with the daughters of Moab (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-6.htm">Numbers 25:6</a>).

They rebelled in Samuel's time by asking for a king (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 19, 20</a>). The ten tribes rebelled under Jeroboam, and set up the idolatry of the calves at Dan and Bethel. Worse idolatries followed, and in two centuries and a half had reached such a height, that God was provoked to "remove Israel out of his sight" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-23.htm">2 Kings 17:23</a>). Judah remained, but "rebelled" under Manasseh, Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah, "transgressing very much after all the abominations of the heathen, and polluting the very house of the Lord at Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). These rebellions against God <span class="cmt_word">vexed his Holy Spirit</span> - "provoked him," "grieved him," "moved the Holy One in Israel" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-40.htm">Psalm 78:40, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he was turned to be their enemy</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4, 5</a>). Judah had "filled up the measure of her iniquities," had gone on "until there was no remedy" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>). God's indignation was therefore poured out upon her without let or stint. "He cut oft' in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he drew back his right hand from before the enemy; he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. He bent his <span class="accented">bow like an enemy</span>; he stood with his right hand <span class="accented">as an adversary</span>, and slew all that were pleasant in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire.

He fought against them; rather, <span class="accented">he himself fought against them.</span> God himself, though they were "his people," yet fought against them and for the Chaldeans in that final struggle.

The "him" of this passage undoubtedly refers to "the people" (Rosenmuller, Knobel, Delitzsch, Kay, Cheyne). God gave to the people in the wilderness "his good Spirit to instruct them" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>), and guide them (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-4.htm">Haggai 2:4, 5</a>), and govern them (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>).

Israel's passage through the Sinaitic peninsula into Canaan is compared to the movement of a herd of cattle from its summer pastures in the mountains to the valley at their base, where for a time it rests.

From thanksgiving and confession, the people betake themselves to prayer, and beseech God to look down from heaven once more, to have compassion on them, to acknowledge them, and to save them alike from themselves (ver. 17) and from their adversaries (vers. 18, 19). "It is difficult to overrate the  spiritual beauty of the prayer contained in this passage. We may admit that the most prominent motive urged by the speaker has a nationalistic air; but behind this, and strengthening it, is a sense of the infiniteness of the Divine mercy, and of the <span class="accented">strong</span> vitality of the union between Jehovah and his people" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Look down from heaven</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8.htm">2 Kings 8</a>:30).

The reproach borders on irreverence, but is kept within the limits of piety by the affection and trust that underlie it. They are like wayward children reproaching a tender mother, not quite believing in the justice of their reproaches, but with a very confident faith in her love and in her power to aid.

Not content with praying God to look upon them once more with favour (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>), Israel now asks for a theophany, or manifestation of the Divine Presence, such as they have experienced in the times of old, and such as shall suffice to strike terror into the hearts of their enemies (vers. 1-4). With profound humility confessing their manifold and grievous iniquities, they beseech God once more, as their Father and Maker, to have pity upon them, reminding him of the desolate condition of Judaea and Jerusalem, and urging him no longer to "refrain himself" (vers. 5-12). "The manner," as Mr. Cheyne observes, "is that of a liturgical psalm; the prophet, as it were, leads the devotions of the assembled Church," and utters in impassioned language the feelings which deeply move them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oh that thou wouldest rend the</span> <span class="cmt_word">heavens!</span> God "dwells in the thick darkness" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-1.htm">2 Chronicles 6:1</a>).

Micah saw the Lord "coming forth out of his place," and "the mountains were molten under him, and the valleys cleft" (<a href="../../par/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3, 4</a>). The mountains represent that which is most firm and solid and strong upon the face of the earth. If even they "melt and flow and tremble" at the presence of God, what might must his be!

Mr. Cheyne regards it as hopelessly corrupt. Bishop Lowth and Ewald attempt emendations.

The groves and "gardens" of Daphne, near Antioch. became famous in later times as the scene of idolatrous practices intimately bound up with the grossest and most shameless sensualism. We have few details of the ancient Syrian rites; but there is reason to believe that, wherever Astarte, the Dea Syra, was worshipped, whether at Daphne, or at Hierapolis, or at Balbek, or at Aphek, or at Damascus, or in Palestine, one and the same character of cult prevailed. The nature-goddess was viewed as best worshipped by rites into which sensualism entered as an essential element. Profligacy that cannot be described polluted the consecrated precincts, which were rendered attractive by all that was beautiful and delightful, whether in art or nature-by groves, gardens, statues, fountains, shrines, temples, music, processions, shows - and which were in consequence frequented both day and night by a multitude of votaries. <span class="cmt_word">And burneth incense upon altars of brick</span>; literally, upon the bricks. It is not clear that "altars" are intended.

Brick altars are nowhere mentioned. The Assyrians and Babylonians made their altars of either stone or metal ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. pp. 36, 37; Herod., 1. 183). The Hebrews in early times had altars of earth (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The "altar of incense" in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-3</a>) was of wood plated with gold; that of burnt offering, of wood plated with bronze (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>). Solomon's altars were similar. Elijah on one occasion made an altar of twelve rough stones (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>).

They do not appear to have been employed for the purpose either by the Assyrians or the Babylonians. It was probably in Palestine that the Jews had eaten "swine's flesh," at sacrifices to Baal or Astarte (Ashtoreth).

In Isaiah, and especially in the "Book of Consolation" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.), promises are almost always intermingled with threatenings. The threats extend to the bulk of the nation; the promises are limited to "a remnant," since a remnant only could be brought to "seek" and serve God (ver. 10). Here the announcement that a remnant would be spared is introduced by a simile from men's treatment of their own vineyards (ver. 8). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As the new wine is found in the cluster</span>; rather, as <span class="accented">when new wine is found in a grape-bunch</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as when even a single cluster of grapes is spied on a vine-stem, the vine-pruners say one to another, "Destroy not that stem, but spare it," so will God refrain from destroying those stocks in his vineyard, which give even a small promise of bearing good fruit. <span class="cmt_word">Destroy it not</span>.

The prophet returns, in the main, to his former attitude, and resumes his denunciations (vers. 11, 12); but, with ver. 13, he begins to intermingle promises of favour to God's servants with threats against the rebellious, and finally (in ver. 16) turns wholly towards the side of grace and favour, announcing the coming of a time when "the former troubles" will be altogether "forgotten," and the kingdom of truth and right will be established. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye are they that forsake the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but as for you who forsake the</span>  <span class="accented">Lord. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And forget my holy mountain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either, literally, <span class="accented">forget</span> Zion. being absent from it so long (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-5.htm">Psalm 137:5</a>), or, possibly, <span class="accented">neglect</span> Zion, though you might worship there if you pleased. <span class="cmt_word">That prepare a table for that troop</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that prepare a table for Gad.</span> There is ground for believing that "Gad" was a Phoenician deity, perhaps "the god of good fortune" (Cheyne), though this is not clearly ascertained; sometimes worshipped as an aspect of Baal, whence the name, Baal-Gad (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>); sometimes connected with other deities, as Moloch and Ashtoreth. The practice of "preparing tables" for the heathen gods was a common one, and appears in Herod., 1:181; in Baruch 6:30; in Bel and the Dragon, ver. 11; and in the Roman <span class="accented">lectisternia.</span> The tables prepared for the dead in Egyptian tombs were not very different, and implied a qualified worship of ancestors (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. pp. 423, 424; vol. 2 p. 39).

The word may be suspected to be cognate to the Arabic "Manat," a god recognized in the Koran as a mediator with Allah; but can scarcely have any connection with the Aryan names for the moon deity, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">Mena</span>, and the like.

The religious exiles would return to the land of promise as soon as permitted, and would there prosper in a worldly sense - have abundance to eat and drink, rejoice, and sing for joy (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11-13</a>). The irreligious, remaining in Babylonia, would suffer hunger and thirst, endure shame, cry and howl for sorrow and vexation of spirit. This would be one fulfilment of the prophecy; but there would also be another. God's servants at all times and in all places would be sustained with spiritual food, and "rejoice and sing for joy of heart." His adversaries would everywhere feel a craving for the "meat" and "drink," which alone satisfy the soul, and would be oppressed with care, and with a sense of shame, and suffer anguish of spirit.

The final answer of God to the complaint and prayer of his people (ch. 64.) is now given. The entire existing state of things is to pass away. God will create a new heaven and  a new earth, and place his people therein; and the old conditions will be all changed, and the old grounds of complaint disappear. In the "new Jerusalem" there will be no sorrow, neither "weeping" nor "crying" (ver. 19); life will be greatly prolonged (ver. 20); men will always enjoy the fruit of their labours (vers. 21, 22), and see their children grow up (ver. 23). Prayer will be answered almost before it is uttered (ver. 24). Finally, there will be peace in the animal world, and between the animal world and man. No living thing will kill or hurt another in all God's "holy mountain" (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I create.</span> The same verb is used as in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; and the prophet's idea seems to be that the existing heaven and earth are to be entirely destroyed (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19, 20</a>, and the comment <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>), and a fresh heaven and earth created in their place out of nothing. The "new Jerusalem" is not the old Jerusalem renovated, but is a veritable "new Jerusalem," "created a rejoicing" (ver. 18; scrap. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).

The description which follows in vers. 11, 12 is quite unlike that of the old Jerusalem. A rejoicing. The "new Jerusalem" was to be from the first all joy and rejoicing - a scene of perpetual gladness. Her people also was to be "a joy" or "a delight," since God would delight in them (ver. 19).

The reasons there given are satisfactory: "There shall be no more death, neither sorrow...  neither shall there be any more pain." But these reasons scarcely apply here. For Isaiah's "new Jerusalem" is not without death (ver. 20), nor without sorrow, since it is not without sin (ver. 20), nor, as there is death there, is it without pain. Isaiah's picture, according to Delitzsch, represents the millennial state, not the final condition of the redeemed; but this trait - the absence of <span class="accented">all</span> weeping - can only be literally true of the final state.

Israel, being about to return from the Captivity, had the design of rebuilding the temple and re-establishing the temple worship. God rebukes this design in persons devoid of any spirit of holiness, and warns them that mere formal outward worship is an abomination to him (vers. 1-3). In ver. 4 he threatens them with punishment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>). The Hebrews, while they earnestly desired to have a material emblem of the presence of God in their midst, were deeply impressed with the feeling that no temple could be worthy of him, or other than most unworthy. "Will God," said Solomon, "indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded?" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). And again, "Who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before trim?" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-6.htm">2 Chronicles 2:6</a>). Thus Isaiah's note of warning was no novelty, and might rind responsive echoes in the hearts of many. <span class="cmt_word">Where is the house that ye build unto me?</span> rather, <span class="accented">what manner of house is it that ye would build to me</span>, <span class="accented">add what manner of place for my rest</span>? God needs no "house;" and they cannot build him a house that could be in any way worthy of him. <span class="accented">They</span>, moreover, are unworthy to build him any house, which is the real ground of the refusal. There was no refusal, when the better part of the exiles, having returned, took the building in hand (see <a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-14.htm">Ezra 6:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-8.htm">Haggai 1:8-14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>, etc.).

Sacrifice, without the true spirit of sacrifice, is an abomination (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord," etc.). There, however, the sacrifices are actually offered; here they are hypothetical. The ungodly exiles design to offer sacrifice to God in his temple, when they have rebuilt it (ver. 1). God rejects their offerings by anticipation. <span class="cmt_word">As if he out off a dog's neck</span>; <span class="accented">i.e."</span> would no more please me by the sacrifice than if he were to make an offering of the unclean dog."

With his meat offering, as directed in <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 2</a>. Such a one is no better than he that blesseth (i.e. worships) an idol. It may be suspected that the ritual acts selected for comparison with those of the Levitical law are practices to which the exiles were given (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have chosen</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">as they haw chosen.</span> The clause stands over against the first clause of ver. 4, "As they (<span class="accented">gain hemmah</span>) have chosen their ways, so I (<span class="accented">gain ani</span>) have chosen their delusions."

As God sends on some men "strong delusion that they   should believe a lie" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>), so on others he sends a spirit of childish folly, which makes their conduct silly and headstrong.

Suddenly, without any pains of travail, she will bring forth; and her offspring will be "a nation born at once" (ver. 8).

God descended on Sinai "in fire" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), and led the Israelites through the wilderness by the pillar of the cloud and of fire (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>), and filled the tabernacle with a glory as of fire (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>), and "answered David from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>), and in the same way answered Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>) and Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). Isaiah almost always describes a theophany as a "coming with fire" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-16.htm">Isaiah 10:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-4.htm">Isaiah 27:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12, 14</a>, etc.). The agency of fire in the judgment that will overtake the wicked simultaneously with Christ's second coming, appears in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7-10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">With his</span> <span class="cmt_word">chariots</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a>). "Chariots," in the plural, may be regarded as symbolizing the "hosts" of natural and supernatural forces that God has at his command (Cheyne). Like a whirlwind. The whirring of the wheels of chariots, their noise, the swiftness of their pace, and the destruction that they cause, make this simile most appropriate. To render his anger; or, <span class="accented">to expend his anger - to</span> vent it.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a></div><div class="verse">They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one <i>tree</i> in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that sanctify... themselves</span> in the gardens (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>; and see the comment on the latter passage). Behind one tree in the midst; literally, <span class="accented">behind one in the midst.</span> It seems quite impossible that "one" can mean "one tree," when no tree has been mentioned, and gardens do not necessarily contain trees. The marginal rendering, "one after another," is also impossible. The "one in the midst" must have been either a hierophant who directed the ceremonies (Gesenius, Hitzig, Knobel, Delitzsch), or an image of a deity (Scaliger, Voss, Grotius, Lagarde, Cheyne). In the latter case, we must suppose that the worshippers had a scruple about mentioning the deity's name, and were accustomed to call him "one," or "a certain one" (comp. Herod., 2:171). Isaiah adopts their usage. <span class="cmt_word">Eating swine's</span> <span class="cmt_word">flesh</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). And the abomination. The word is used generically of all the "abominable things" forbidden to be eaten in <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4-30</a>, as the camel, the coney, the hare, the eagle, the vulture, the ferret, the chameleon, the lizard, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The mouse</span>.

There is no verb in the Hebrew text, from which something has evidently fallen out. Mr. Cheyne supplies, "I will punish;" Gratz, "I have seen."

The awful destruction of the wicked, and their eternal sufferings, shall at the same time be held in remembrance. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">I will set a sign among them.</span> Dr. Kay suggests that the "sign" is the resurrection of our Lord, or possibly a miraculous manifestation of Christ which is to precede his coming in judgment. Mr. Cheyne, less venturesome, finds in the prophet's words merely a suggestion of "some mysterious event, which he leaves his awestruck readers to imagine." <span class="cmt_word">Those that escape of them</span>. Not, surely, those of God's enemies that survive the slaughter, but "the remnant" of Jews, that are not among God's enemies, and so "escape." These shall be sent (as missionaries) to the distant nations; not literally to those enumerated, but to such as at the end of the world occupy a position which the nations mentioned occupied on Isaiah's horizon. Of these nations, Tarshish (Tartessus) was at the furthest limit westward, Pul and Lud, or rather Phut and Lud, at the furthest limit southward, Tubal and Javan at the furthest limit northward, Pul, which occurs nowhere else in Scripture as a geographic name, is almost certainly a wrong reading for Phut, which occurs in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-6.htm">Genesis 10:6</a>, and also three times (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>) in connection with Lud. Phut designates an African nation, probably the Nubians, whom the Egyptians called Pet, and who were noted as bowmen. Wetstein's conjecture of "Pun" (Punici, 'Phoenicians '), commended by Mr. Cheyne, is quite unsupported and highly improbable. Lud. It is tempting to connect "Lud" with the Lydians, who were certainly known as "<span class="accented">Lndi"</span> to the Assyrians of the time of Asshur-bani-pal (B.C. 669-626). But the other scriptural notices of "Lud" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>), which uniformly connect it with Phut, point rather to an African people.

Tubal stands, no doubt, for the Tibareni, a people of the Asiatic highland west of the Upper Euphrates, called <span class="accented">Tuplai</span> or <span class="accented">Tabali</span> by the Assyrians. They would occupy Isaiah's northern and north-western horizon, in company with Javan, or the Ionians (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), who were among the chief people of Asia Minor.

Upon horses. The "new Jerusalem" being localized, the converts from the distant regions are represented as journeying from their own lands to the "holy mountain," and bringing the Jewish exiles with them by various methods of conveyance - upon horses, mules, and dromedaries, in chariots, and finally in palanquins or litters. "Litters" were used by the great men among the Egyptians from a very early date (see Rosellini, 'Monumenti Civili,' pl. 93, fig. 2; Wilkinson, ' Ancient Egyptians,' vol. 2. p. 208). They were also employed by the Persians (Herod., 3:146) and by the later Romans. As the children of Israel bring an offering; rather, <span class="accented">bring the meat offering.</span> The existence of the temple, and the continuance of the Levitical rites at the time of the delivery of this prophecy, are clearly implied.

But St. Paul speaks of all such privileges as already abolished in his day (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>); and, if the priesthood is to be common to both Gentile and Jew, the principle of equality would seem to be conceded. Perhaps no more is here meant than that, as the "new heaven and new earth" will always remain, so there will always remain a seed of true believers to worship God in them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-23.htm">Isaiah 66:23</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">From one new moon to another, and from</span> <span class="cmt_word">one sabbath to another</span>. Not that "new moons" and "sabbaths" will continue to be observed, for "new moons" have already lapsed, and "sabbaths" too will lapse when life is one perpetual sabbath passed in the worship of God. The phrase, used by the prophet is intended to express   absolute continuance without an interval. <span class="cmt_word">Shall all</span> <span class="cmt_word">flesh come to worship before me</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/65-2.htm">Psalm 65:2</a>). The prophet still uses habitual modes of expression, though speaking of a time and circumstances to which they are no longer appropriate. "The literal meaning," as Dr. Pusey says ('Prophecy of Jesus,' p. 39), "was physically impossible." "All flesh," in all regions of the "new earth," could not worship in one spot, "and so it was plain that Isaiah spoke of a worship other than that at any given place"  - of a worship such as that whereof our Lord spoke to the Samaritan woman, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father" (<a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases</span>, etc. Here is more imagery, which it is impossible to understand literally. The carcases could not remain always to be looked at, nor while they remained could the sight of them be otherwise than loathsome to God's redeemed saints. Again, they could not be at the same time burnt with fire and eaten by worms. "The prophet, by the very mode of description adopted by him, precludes the possibility of our conceiving of the thing set forth as realized in any material form in this present state. He is speaking of the future state, but <span class="accented">in figures</span> drawn from the present world" (Delitzsch). Does he mean more than this - that the redeemed shall have in their thoughts, at any rate from time to time, the fact that, while they have by God's great mercy been saved and brought into His  kingdom, there are those who have not been saved, but lie for ever under the awful sentence of God's wrath? This is a knowledge which the redeemed must have, and which may well produce a salutary effect on them, intensifying their gratitude and maintaining in them a spirit of reverent fear<span class="cmt_word">. Their worm shall not die, neither shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">their fire be quenched</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/mark/9-44.htm">Mark 9:44, 46, 48</a>). It cannot be by chance that the evangelical prophet concludes his glorious prophecy with this terrible note of warning. Either he was divinely directed thus to terminate his teaching, or he felt the need that there was of his emphasizing all the many warnings dispersed throughout his "book" by a final, never-to-be-forgotten picture. The undying worm and the quenchless fire - images introduced by him - became appropriated thenceforth to the final condition of impenitent sinners (Jud. 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17), and were even adopted by our Lord himself in the same connection (<a href="../../par/mark/9.htm">Mark 9</a>.). The incongruity of the two images shows that they are not to be understood literally; but both alike imply everlasting continuance, and are incompatible with either of the two modern heresies of universalism or annihilationism. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be an abhorring unto all flesh</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>, where the word <span class="accented">deraon</span> is rendered "contempt"). The Jewish rabbis regarded it as anomalous that any portion of Scripture should conclude with words of ill omen. When, therefore, this chapter was read in the synagogue, or the last of Ecclesiastes, or Lamentations, or Malachi, they directed that after the reading of the last verse, the last verse but one should he repeated, to correct the sad impression that would otherwise have been left upon the mind. But Isaiah thought it salutary to leave this sad impression (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/65.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 65"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 65" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/isaiah/6.htm"><title>Isaiah 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/isaiah/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/isaiah/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/isaiah/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../isaiah/5.htm" title="Isaiah 5">&#9668;</a> Isaiah 6 <a href="../isaiah/7.htm" title="Isaiah 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - THE VISION OF GOD SEEN BY ISAIAH. It is thought by some that this vision, and its sequel, constitute the original call of Isaiah to the prophetical office, and in order of time precede all the other contents of the book. But the position of the "vision" in the book is strongly against this view. Prophets who relate their original call naturally place it in the forefront of their narrative (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). It is quite possible, as Bishop Lowth says, that this was "a <span class="accented">new</span> designation, to introduce more solemnly a general declaration of the whole course of God's dispensations in regard to his people, and the fates of the nations." The vision itself may profitably be compared with Ezekiel's first vision, which it much resembles (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the year that King Uzziah died.</span> The year  <span class="date">B.C. 759</span>, probably.

The Lord. Not "Jehovah," as in vers. 3 and 5, but "Adonay," for greater reverence. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up.</span> The imagery is, of course, taken from the practice of earthly kings. Elaborate thrones were affected by the great monarchs of Egypt and Assyria (Lepsius, 'Deutmaler,' pt. 3. pls. 2, 76, 100, 121; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 150). Solomon's throne was perhaps even grander than any of these (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18-20</a>). It was placed at the summit of "<span class="accented">six</span> steps," so that its occupant was "<span class="accented">high</span> and lifted up" above all his courtiers. <span class="cmt_word">His train.</span> Not his train of attendants, but "the skirts of his robe." Flowing robes were commonly worn by great monarchs. <span class="cmt_word">Filled the temple</span>; or, <span class="accented">the palace</span>. The same word is used in Hebrew for both. Dr. Kay supposes the prophet to be "in vision gazing on the actual temple - to see its veils drawn aside, and instead of the Shechinah enthroned on the cherubim, to behold the King of glory, enthroned on high, the fringes of his royal robe filling the temple, so that no human priest could minister there." But, as Mr. Cheyne observes, "palace is more in harmony with the picture than temple." It is the heavenly palace of the King of kings into which the prophet's gaze is allowed to penetrate.

They appeared to the prophet as standing above the King as he sat upon his throne - "standing" to show their readiness to minister; but why "above him" is not so clear. Perhaps, simply, as those that stand are "above" those that sit; perhaps as ready to fly through infinite space at the bidding of him who was seated in his palace, as it were upon the ground. Their form, as seen by the prophet, appears to have been human, and only distinguished from ordinary humanity by the wings. Thus, though in name they resembled those other "fiery ones," which had punished the Jews in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6-9</a>), there is nothing to show that Isaiah in any way connected the two. <span class="cmt_word">Each one had six wings</span>. Gesenius is mistaken in saying that there are at Persepolis any six-winged figures ('Thesaurus,' p. 1342). The Persians not infrequently represented their genii with four wings ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 353, 354); but no six-winged figures have been found, so far as I know, among the Persian remains. <span class="cmt_word">With twain he covered his face</span>, etc. The general idea of the six wings was probably rapid flight, the carrying out of God's behests "with speed swiftly." But, in the Divine presence, the wings were applied to a different use. One pair veiled the seraph's head from the intolerable effulgence of the Divine glory; another concealed the feet, soiled in their various ministrations, and unmeet for the all-pure presence; the third pair alone sustained the seraph in mid-air, as he hovered in readiness to depart on any errand on which Jehovah aright send him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, <i>is</i> the LORD of hosts: the whole earth <i>is</i> full of his glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One cried</span>; rather, <span class="accented">kept crying</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8</a>, "They rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy"). But the prophet scarcely goes so far; he describes only his vision - they did not rest while the vision was vouchsafed him. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy</span>. The Church on earth has taken pattern by the Church above; and the "Trisagion" is ever being repeated in one part of the earth or another without ceasing: "Thou continuest holy, O thou Worship of Israel." There is no attribute so essential to God as this. It is for his holiness, more than for anything else, that his creatures worship him. The triple repetition has been understood in all ages of the Church as connected with the doctrine of the Trinity. Holy is he who has created us, and bidden us worship him in the beauty of holiness Holy is he who has redeemed us, and washed away our sins, and made us by profession holy! Holy is he who day by day sanctifies us, and makes us in very deed and truth, so far as we will permit him, holy! <span class="cmt_word">The whole earth is full of his glory</span>. Even in heaven the seraphic thoughts are turned to earth, and its relation to its Divine Creator is made the subject of angelic utterances (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>). The lesson which they gather from their contemplation, even under all the miserable circumstances of the time, is a cheering one: "The whole earth is full of God's glory." Men, whether they will it or not, are working out God's purposes, advancing his designs, accomplishing the ends that he desires (see Homiletics on Isaiah 5:25-29).

The vision of God in this life, whether natural or ecstatic, cannot but produce in the beholder a deep feeling of his unworthiness. God "is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;" even "the heavens are not clean in his sight" (<a href="../../par/job/15-15.htm">Job 15:15</a>). Man, being never wholly purged from sin while on earth, cannot but shrink from contact with the absolutely Holy. Hence Isaiah's cry (ver. 5); and hence, to comfort him, the symbolic action of the seraph (ver. 6) and his encouraging words (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am undone</span>; literally, <span class="accented">cut off</span>, <span class="accented">destroyed</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5, 6</a>, etc.). God once said himself, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>).

Isaiah felt that he had often so offended. His lips were not "<span class="accented">clean"</span> in God's sight, and if not his lips, then not his heart; for "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-34.htm">Matthew 12:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.</span> Men catch up the phraseology of their time, and use wrong forms of speech, because they hear them daily.

The altar is, no doubt, an altar of incense, and of gold, not of stone; but the incense is burnt upon stones heated to a glow, and it is one of these stones which the angel takes with the golden tongs of the sanctuary (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-38.htm">Exodus 25:38</a>).

We do not know what special call Isaiah had had previously. Perhaps he had been brought up in the "schools of the prophets." Perhaps, when the "word of the Lord" came to him, he had accepted the fact as sufficient call. Now, however, he had, in vision, a clear and distinct call and mission (vers. 8, 9). He was told to "go," and instructed as to what he was to say (vers. 9, 10). As before (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1-5</a>.), while in the main he was to denounce woe, he was still to proclaim the survival of a remnant (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom shall I send?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>). Such questions enable those who wait in the courts of heaven to show their zeal and readiness. <span class="cmt_word">Who will go for us?</span> Some explain the plural pronoun as used of the Almighty and those with whom he is consulting. But he does not really "consult" his creatures (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-14.htm">Isaiah 40:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-34.htm">Romans 11:34</a>), nor do his messengers do his errands <span class="accented">for them</span>. The plural form is best explained by the light which ver. 3 throws on it, as indicative of the doctrine of the Trinity (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear ye indeed... see ye indeed</span>; literally, <span class="accented">In</span> <span class="accented">hearing hear</span>... <span class="accented">in seeing see -</span> with the force of "Listen and bear; look and see;" "Attend, "that is," with the outward souse, and catch all that sense can catch, but without perception of the inward meaning" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-12.htm">Mark 4:12</a>, etc.).

In Kings the alliance between Rezin and Pekah is distinctly declared, as also the fact that they conjointly besieged Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-5.htm">2 Kings 16:5</a>). From Chronicles we learn that, before the siege, Ahaz was twice defeated with great loss, once by the Syrians (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5</a>), and once by the Israelites (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6</a>).

Pekah had been an officer under Pekahiah, the son and successor of Menahem; but had revolted, put Pekahiah to death in his palace, and seized the crown. It is probable that he and Rezin were anxious to form a confederacy for the purpose of resisting the advance of the Assyrian power, and, distrusting Ahaz, desired to place on the throne of Judah a person on whom they could thoroughly depend (see ver. 6). It was not their design to conquer the Jewish kingdom, but only to change the sovereign. <span class="cmt_word">Toward Jerusalem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">to Jerusalem</span>.

But occasionally, under the pressure of a great danger, the relations were changed, and a temporary league was formed. The inscriptions of Shalmaneser II. show such a league to have existed in the time of Benhadad II. and Ahab ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. it. pp. 103, 104).

This was the year in which Esar-haddon, having made his son, Asshur-bani-pal, King of Assyria, transferred his own residence to Babylon, and probably the year in which he sent from Babylonia and the adjacent countries a number of colonists who occupied Samaria, and entirely destroyed the nationality, which, fifty-three years earlier, had received a rude blow from Sargon (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2, 9, 10</a>, with <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-24</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>). It is questioned whether, under the circumstances, the prophet can have comforted Ahaz with this distant prospect, and suggested that in the present chapter prophecies pronounced at widely distant periods have been mixed up (Cheyne); but there is no such appearance of dislocation in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, in its present form, as necessitates any such theory; and, while it may be granted that the comfort of the promise given in ver. 8 would be slight, it cannot be said that it would be <span class="accented">nil</span>; it may, therefore, have been (as it seems to us) without impropriety added to the main promise, which is that of ver. 7.

Full faith in the promise of ver. 7 would have enabled Ahaz to dispense with all plans of earthly policy, and to "stand fast in the Lord," without calling in the aid of any "arm of flesh." Distrust of the promise would lead him to take steps which would not tend to "establish" him, but would make his position more insecure (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-16.htm">2 Chronicles 28:16, 20</a>).

The supposition that there was a considerable interval between ver. 9 and ver. 10 (Cheyne) is quite gratuitous. Nothing in the text marks any such interval. God had sent Ahaz one message by his prophet (vers. 4-9). It had apparently been received in silence, at any rate without acknowledgment. The faith had seemed to be lacking which should have embraced with gladness the promise given (see the last clause of ver. 9). God, however, will give the unhappy monarch another chance. And so he scuds him a second message, the offer of a sign which should make belief in the first message easier to him (ver. 11). Ahaz proudly rejects this offer (ver. 12). Then the sign of "Immanuel" is given - not to Ahaz individually, but to the whole "house of David," and through them to the entire Jewish people. "A virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, whose name shall be called Immanuel; and before this child shall have grown to the age of moral discernment, God's people will have been delivered, and their enemies made a desolation" (vers. 14-16).

Asking for a sign is right or wrong, praiseworthy or blamable, according to the spirit in which the request is made. The Pharisees in our Lord's time "asked for a sign," but would not have believed any the more had they received the sign for which they asked. Gideon asked for a sign to strengthen his faith (<a href="../../par/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37, 39</a>), and received it, and in the strength of it went forth boldly against the Midianites. When God himself proposed to give a sign, and allowed his creature to choose what the sign should be, there could be no possible wrong-doing in a ready acceptance of the offer, which should have called forth gratitude and thanks. <span class="cmt_word">Ask it either in the depth, or in the height above</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Ask any sign thou wilt, either in hell or in heaven" - nothing shall be refused thee.

Ahaz, who has no wish for a sign, because he has no wish to believe in any other salvation than flint which will follow from the realization of his own schemes, finds a plausible reason for declining to ask for one in those passages of the Law which forbade men to" tempt God" (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16</a>).

Few prophecies have been the subject of so much controversy, or called forth such a variety of exegesis, as this prophecy of Immanuel. Rosenm&uuml;ller gives a list of twenty-eight authors who have written dissertations upon it, and himself adds a twenty-ninth. Yet the subject is far from being exhausted. It is still asked: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Were the mother and son persons belonging to the time of Isaiah himself, and if so, what persons? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Were they the Virgin Mary and her Son Jesus? Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had the prophecy a double fulfillment, first in certain persons who lived in Isaiah's time, and secondly in Jesus and his mother? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> The first theory is that of the Jewish commentators. Originally, they suggested that the mother was Abi, the wife of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), and the son Hezekiah, who delivered Judah from the Assyrian power (see Justin, 'Dial. cum Tryphon.,' p. 262). But this was early disproved by showing that, according to the numbers of Kings (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-2.htm">2 Kings 16:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-2.htm">2 Kings 18:2</a>), Hezekiah was at least nine years old in the first year of Ahaz, before which this prophecy could not have been delivered (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>). The second suggestion made identified the mother with Isaiah's wife, the "prophetess" of <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>, and made the son a child of his, called actually Immanuel, or else his son Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1</a>) under a symbolical designation. But <span class="accented">ha-'almah</span>, "the virgin," would be a very strange title for Isaiah to have given his wife, and the rank assigned to Immanuel in <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a> would not suit any son of Isaiah's. It remains to regard the '<span class="accented">almah</span> as "some young woman actually present," name, rank, and position unknown, and Immanuel as her son, also otherwise unknown (Cheyne). But the  grand exordium, "The Lord himself shall give you a sign - Behold!" and the rank of Immanuel (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>), are alike against this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">II.</span> The purely Messianic theory is maintained by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Dr. Kay, but without any consideration of its difficulties. The birth of Christ was an event more than seven hundred years distant. In what sense and to what persons could it be a "sign" of the coming deliverance of the land from Rezin and Pekah? And, upon the purely Messianic theory, what is the meaning of ver. 16? Syria and Samaria were, in fact, crushed within a few years of the delivery of the prophecy. Why is their desolation put off, apparently, till the coming of the Messiah, and even till he has reached a certain age? Mr. Cheyne meets these difficulties by the startling statement that Isaiah expected the advent of the Messiah to synchronize with the Assyrian invasion, and consequently thought that before Rezin and Pekah were crushed he would have reached the age of discernment. But he does not seem to see that in this case the sigma was altogether disappointing and illusory. Time is an essential element of a prophecy which turns upon the word "before" (ver. 16). If this faith of Isaiah's disciples was aroused and  their hopes raised by the announcement that Immanuel was just about to be born (Mr. Cheyne translates, "A virgin <span class="accented">is</span> with child"), what would be the revulsion of feeling when no Immanuel appeared? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">III.</span> May not the true account of the matter be that suggested by Bishop Lowth  - that the prophecy had a double bearing and a double fulfillment? "The obvious and literal meaning of the prophecy is this," he says: "that within the time that a young woman, now a virgin, should conceive and bring forth a child, and that child should arrive at such an age as to distinguish between good and evil, that is, within a few years, the enemies of Judah should be destroyed." But the prophecy was so worded, he adds, as to have a further meaning, which wan even "the original design and <span class="accented">principal</span> intention of the prophet," viz. the Messianic one. All the expressions of the prophecy do not suit both its intentions  - some are selected with reference to the first, others with reference to the second fulfillment - but all suit one or the other, and some suit both. The first child may have received the name Immanuel (comp. Ittiel) from a faithful Jewish mother, who believed that God was with his people, whatever dangers threatened, and may have reached years of discretion about the time that Samaria was carried away captive. The second child is the true "Immanuel," "God with us," the king of <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a>; it is his mother who is pointed at in the expression, "the virgin," and on his account is the grand preamble; through him the people of God, the true Israel, is delivered from its spiritual enemies, sin and Satan - two kings who continually threaten it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The "fly of Egypt," like the "bee of Assyria," represents the military force of the nation, which God summons to take part in the coming affliction of Judaea. The prophetic glance may be extended over the entire period of Judah's decadence, and the "<span class="accented">flies"</span> summoned may include those which clustered about Neco at Megiddo, and carried off Jehoahaz from Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-34</a>). There may be allusion also to Egyptian ravages in the reigns of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Esar-haddon. In any general review of the period we shall find it stated that, from the time of Sargon to that of Cyrus, Judaea was the battle-ground upon which the forces of Assyria (or Assyro-Babylonia) and Egypt contended for the empire of western Asia. The desolation of the land during this period was produced almost as much by the Egyptian "<span class="accented">fly</span> as by the Assyrian <span class="accented">bee</span>." The "rivers of Egypt" are the Nile, its branches, and perhaps the great canals by which its waters were distributed. <span class="cmt_word">The bee that is in the land of Assyria</span>. The choice of the terms "<span class="accented">bee"</span> and "<span class="accented">fly</span>," to represent respectively the hosts of Assyria and Egypt, is not without significance. Egyptian armies were swarms, hastily levied, and very imperfectly disciplined. <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> were bodies of trained troops accustomed to war, and almost as well disciplined as the Romans.

Gesenius and Vance Smith translate "the precipitous valleys;" Mr. Cheyne, "the steeply walled valleys." But the cognate word used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a> can only mean "waste," which supports the rendering of the Authorized Version. The exact word used does not occur elsewhere. Upon all bushes; rather, <span class="accented">upon all pastures</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a></div><div class="verse">In the same day shall the Lord shave with a rasor that is hired, <i>namely</i>, by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired</span>; rather, <span class="accented">with the hired razor</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the razor that Ahaz will have hired (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>). The metaphor well expresses the stripping of the land bare by plunder and exaction (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1, 12</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19-21</a>). God would use Tiglath-Pileser as <span class="accented">his</span> instrument to distress Ahaz. <span class="cmt_word">By them beyond the river</span>; or, <span class="accented">in the parts beyond the river</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16</a>). "The river" is undoubtedly the Euphrates, and they who dwell beyond it the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_word">By the King of Assyria</span>. Once more a gloss is suspected, as in ver. 17. The meaning would certainly be sufficiently plain without the clause. <span class="cmt_word">The head... the hair of the feet... the beard</span>. These three represent all the hair on any part of the body. Judah is to be completely stripped.

The small number of the cattle will allow of each having abundant pasture. Hence they will give an abundance of milk. <span class="cmt_word">He shall eat butter</span>; rather, curds - the solid food most readily obtained from milk (comp. above, ver. 15). Curdled milk and wild honey should form the simple diet of the remnant left in the land. It is, of course, possible to understand this in a spiritual sense, of simple doctrine and gospel honey out of the flinty rock of the Law; but there is no reason to think that the prophet intended his words in any but the most literal sense.

By "silverlings" our translators mean "pieces of silver," probably shekels. "A thousand vines at a thousand shekels" may mean either a thousand vines worth that amount, or a thousand vines rented at that sum annually (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a>). The latter would point to vineyards of unusual goodness, since the shekel is <span class="accented">at least</span> eighteen pence, and the present rent of a vineyard in Palestine is at the rate of a piastre for each vine, or 2&frac12;d. The general meaning would seem to be that not even the best vineyards would be cultivated, but would lie waste, and grow only "briers and thorns."

The sign of Immanuel was recondite. In its more spiritual sense it appealed to faith in an event far distant. Even in its literal import, it was not calculated to cheer and encourage more than a few, since neither the maiden nor the child was pointed out with any distinctness. A fresh sign was therefore given by God's goodness to reassure the mass of the people  - a sign about which there was nothing obscure or difficult. Isaiah himself should have a son born to him almost immediately, to whom he should give a name indicating the rapid approach of the spoiler, and before this child should be able to utter the first words which childhood ordinarily pronounces, "Father," "Mother," Damascus and Samaria should be despoiled. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee a great roll</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">large tablet</span>.

The tablet was probably to be hung up to view in a public place (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>), so that all might read, and the writing was therefore to be such as was in ordinary use. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz</span>. These were the words which were to be written on the tablet, which was to be otherwise left blank. They would naturally excite curiosity, like the strange names placarded in modern streets. The name is literally, "Plunder speeds, spoil hastens." It has been imitated by Goethe in his "Habebald-Eilebeute" ('Faust,' act 4. sc. 3).

Probably the high priest of the time, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>, as the ready tool of Ahaz at a later date. Though a bad man, he may have been a trustworthy witness to a fact. <span class="cmt_word">Zechariah</span>.

It is not necessary to suppose that the wife of Isaiah must have uttered prophecies because she is called "the prophetess." Titles were given in the East to the wives, daughters, etc., of officials, which merely reflected the dignity of their husbands, fathers, etc. Even Miriam seems to be called a "prophetess" (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>) from her close relationship to Moses, rather than from any supernatural power that she had. In the Mishna, a priest's wife or daughter is called "priestess" (Cheyne). <span class="cmt_word">Call his name.</span> There is no reason for doubting that the name was actually given. Other Israelites had such names as Jushab-hosed (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>), Haah-ashtari (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-6.htm">1 Chronicles 4:6</a>), Romamti-ezer (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-4.htm">1 Chronicles 25:4</a>), Machnadebai (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-40.htm">Ezra 10:40</a>), and the like. Assyrian names were even longer; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, As-shur-bel-nisi-su, Asshur-kinat-ili-kain, etc. In ordinary parlance, names of this type were commonly shortened, "Shalman-eser' becoming "Shalmau" (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>), "Sennacherib Jareb" (<a href="../../par/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>), and the like.

"Abi," "Immi," would have been among the first utterances of childhood - simple sounds, combinations of primary vowels with labials, corresponding in easiness of utterance to "Pappy," "Mammy," rather than to the expressions of the text. A child commonly utters such sounds when it is about a year old. <span class="cmt_word">The riches of Damascus</span>. The position of Damascus lay in the direct path of the main trade that was carried on between the West and East, which was conducted by the merchants of Tyro chiefly, and passed from the Syrian coast by way of Damascus and Tadmor to Nineveh and Babylon. This commerce greatly enriched the cities lying upon its route. "Damascus," <span class="accented">says</span> Ezekiel, addressing Tyre, "was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for <span class="accented">the multitude of all riches</span>; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-18.htm">Ezekiel 27:18</a>). The "palaces of Benhadad" seem to have been noted for their magnificence (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-27.htm">Jeremiah 49:27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the King of Assyria.</span> Scripture does not record the fulfillment of this prophecy, which makes the same Assyrian king carry off the spoil of Samaria and the spoil of Damascus, fixing also the time of the carrying off as within a few years of the time when the prophecy was given. But the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser himself supply the deficiency. They state that this monarch "sent the population, the goods of the people of Beth-Omri, and their furniture to the land of Assyria;" after which he "appointed Husih (Hoshea) to the dominion ever them," and fixed their annual tribute at two talents of gold and a thousand talents of silver (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 52).

Syria and Samaria were barriers, breakwaters, so placed as to stem the tide of invasion, and be a defense to Judaea against Assyrian attack. When once they were overwhelmed, the waters would have free course, and the submersion of Judaea was certain. It might be delayed by the Divine favor, and would be, so long as the people, or even a remnant of them, remained faithful, but only through the might of the name Immanuel, "God with us." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as this people.</span> It is a question which people is intended, Judah or Israel. Ewald supposes Judah, and draws the conclusion that there was a strong party in Jerusalem which favored "the son of Tabeal." Dr. Kay does the same, but understands the charge against Judah to be, not that it sympathized with Rezin, but that it fell into the same sins. Other commentators suggest that Israel is the people intended (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>), the sense being carried on from ver. 4, where the word "Samaria" is suggestive of the Israelite people. <span class="cmt_word">Refuseth the waters of Shiloah</span>. The "pool of Siloah" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>) was the tank or reservoir at the southwestern foot of Ophel, which is supplied with water by a narrow conduit cut through the limestone rock for a distance of 1750 feet from the "Pool of the Virgin" on the opposite side of Ophel, in the Kedron valley. This pool itself is fed from reservoirs under the temple area, which have not yet been fully explored. It is probable that Isaiah uses the expression "waters of Shiloah" in a general sense for the streams, springs, reservoirs, conduits, which supplied the temple, and were connected with its service. "Refusing the waters of Shiloah" would then be, without any violent metaphor, refusing the temple service and worship, which was exactly what the Israelites had done from the time of Jeroboam. <span class="cmt_word">That go softly</span>. In contrast with the "waters of the river, strong and many," of the next verse. They who refused the mild and gentle government of Jehovah should experience the impetuous and torrent-like rush of the Assyrian armies. <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice in Rezin</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rejoice with Rezin</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sympathize with him, rejoice when he rejoices.

In its lower course the Euphrates often overflows its banks, and inundates the adjacent districts, causing vast damage to crops, and some-limes threatening to break down the walls of cities (Loftus, 'Chaldea and Susiana,' p. 7). It is scarcely likely, however, that Isaiah had any acquaintance with this fact. His experience would probably have been limited to the "swellings of Jordan" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All his glory</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12, 16, 18</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">He shall come up over all his channels.</span> A graphic description of the swelling of rivers in the East. These, when they are low, contract their waters from the many channels, in which they ordinarily flow, into some one or two, leaving the others dry. The first effect of a flood is to fill all the channels, after which it may proceed further and overflow the banks. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/8-8.htm">Isaiah 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach <i>even</i> to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall pass through Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">he shall</span> pass on <span class="accented">into Judah</span> ("He shall sweep onward into Judah," Revised Version). The <span class="accented">Assyrians</span> will not be content with invading Syria and Samaria; they will "<span class="accented">pass</span> on into Judaea." It is not clear whether this is to be done immediately by <span class="accented">Tiglath-Pileser</span>, or by one of his successors at a later date. There is reason to believe from Tiglath-Pileser's inscriptions that he used the territory of Ahaz for the passage of his armies as those of a vassal king, but did not ravage them. <span class="cmt_word">He shall reach even to the neck</span>. The Assyrian attacks on Judaea shall stop short of destroying it. The flood shall not submerge the head, but only rise as high as the neck. This prophecy was fulfilled, since it was not Assyria, but Babylon, which destroyed the Jewish kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">The stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land.</span> The Assyrian armies shall visit every part of the land. The sudden change of metaphor is in the manner of Isaiah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-30.htm">Isaiah 1:30, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24, 30</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">O Immanuel</span>. On the importance of this address, as indicating the kingly, and so (probably) the Divine character of Immanuel, see the notes on Isaiah 7:14. Isaiah could not speak of the land as belonging to his own infant son.

Having declared his absolute confidence, not only that the attack of Pekah and Rezin will fail (vers. 1-4), but that Assyria also (ver. 8), nay, that all the nations of the earth (ver. 9) will fail, and bring destruction upon themselves, if they "devise devices" against God's true people, the prophet explains the ground of his confidence by relating a special "instruction" which he had received from God some time previously, he had been bidden to separate himself from the mass of his countrymen in thought and feeling, and to cling only to Jehovah, who would "be for a Sanctuary" (ver. 14) to his own, but "for a Stone of stumbling and a Rock of offence" to all others. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord.</span> Mr. Cheyne regards this passage as "a short oracle, complete in itself," and entirely unconnected with what has preceded.

It was not merely idolatry against which he was warned, but the whole spirit and tone of the society of his day. He was not to entertain their suspicions, or to hope their hopes, or to fear their fears. He was to take a line of his own, to fear God and him only; then God would be "for a Sanctuary" to him.

The transition from the singular to the plural is noticeable.

It is questioned whether something has not fallen out between vers. 16 and 17. The transition is exceedingly abrupt, undoubtedly; but perhaps not more abrupt than elsewhere in Isaiah and the prophets contemporary with him. The Divine "instruction" comes to an end in ver. 16; and Isaiah might have been expected to comment on it, or enforce its teaching; but he does neither. He simply states what his own attitude will be under the coming calamity (ver. 8). He will "wait for the Lord and look to him" (ver. 17), and consider himself and his children as doing a work for God in being "signs" (ver. 18) - signs to which the rest of Israel may look, and from which they may derive sufficient hope and confidence to carry them through the dark time which is approaching. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will wait upon the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I will wait for the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "await the time of his relenting" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">That hideth his face from the house of Jacob</span> (compare the threats in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>). The light of God's countenance is to the spiritual what that of the sun is to the material world. All life, health, joy, happiness, proceed from it. This light was now to be withdrawn for a time on account of the people's sins. But Isaiah would "wait" for its reappearance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me <i>are</i> for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I and the children... are for signs.</span> Isaiah's children seem to have been "for signs," especially in respect of their names. Shear-Jashub meant "A remnant shall return" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-21.htm">Isaiah 10:21</a>), and thus held out two hopes; one that a remnant of Israel would return to God and become his true servants, another that a remnant would return from the captivity that had been prophesied (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). Maher-shalal-hash-baz - "Plunder speeds, spoil hastens" - was a "sign" of a different kind. Primarily, his name referred to the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria (vers. 3, 4); but it may further have indicated a time of general disturbance, plunder, and ravage. It is not quite clear in what respects Isaiah was a "sign." Perhaps he, too, in his name, which meant "(Our) salvation is Jehovah" - certainly also in his symbolical acts (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>), and possibly in the firmness of his faith, which never wavered. <span class="cmt_word">From the Lord of hosts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from by the Lord of hosts -</span> an expression like the French <span class="accented">de chez</span>. God had supernaturally appointed the sign in one case (vers. 1-4), but in the other two had merely brought them about by the secret working of his providence. But the prophet treats all three as coming equally from him. <span class="cmt_word">Which dwelleth in Mount Zion</span>. Hero, again, is encouragement. God has not quitted Zion. The Shechinah still rests between the cherubim in the holy of holies. While this is so, God is still <span class="accented">with</span> his people (Immanuel).

AFFLICTION WILL BRING ISRAEL TO GOD. Isaiah returns, in ver. 19, to the consideration of his disciples. In the terrible times impending, they will be recommended to have recourse to necromancy; he urges that they should look to God and the Law. He then further suggests that, in the coming affliction which he describes (vers. 21, 22), men will generally turn for relief to the same quarter (ver. 20). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seek unto them that have familiar spirits.</span> In times of great distress the Israelites seem always to have been tempted to consult those among them who pretended to magic and divination. So Saul in the Philistine war resorted to the witch of Endor (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-20</a>); Manasseh, threatened by Esar-haddon, "used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Israel generally, oppressed by Syria and Assyria, "used divination and enchantments" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-17.htm">2 Kings 17:17</a>). There was the same inclination now on the part of many Jews. The vexed question of the actual powers possessed by such persons cannot be discussed within the limits of a footnote. It has, moreover, already been treated in the present Commentary, in connection with <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Wizards that peep, and that mutter</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that chirp and mutter</span>.

For thirty years he had dwelt at Nazareth, in Zebulon.

"Upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim," he commenced his preaching of repentance (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-17</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-3.htm">Isaiah 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast multiplied the nation, <i>and</i> not increased the joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, <i>and</i> as <i>men</i> rejoice when they divide the spoil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy</span>. Dr. Kay defends this reading, and supposes a contrast of time between this clause and the next; he renders, "Thou <span class="accented">didst</span> multiply the nation" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the days of Solomon and again in those of Uzziah) "and not increase the joy; <span class="accented">but now</span>," etc. The objection is that the verbs are all in the same tense, the simple preterit, and that there is nothing in the original corresponding to "but now." Almost all other recent commentators accept the solution offered by the Masoretic reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>), which makes the passage simple and easy: "Thou hast multiplied the nation; its joy thou hast increased; they joy before thee," etc. (So many Hebrew manuscripts, the Alexandrine Septuagint, the Syriac, Gesenius, Knobel, Cheyne, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">According to the joy in harvest.</span> "The joy in harvest" was to the Jews the joy of the Feast of Tabernacles, or in gathering (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), held when the last fruits were brought in. But the prophet is perhaps taking a wider view, and thinking of the many harvest festivals prevailing throughout Western Asia, all of them originating in gratitude to the Giver of all good, and many of them comprising manifestations of joy more jubilant than those habitual to his sedater countrymen.

Not, however, in an earthly sense, since the Messiah's kingdom was not of this world. The "yoke" is that of sin, the "oppressor" is that prince of darkness, who had well-nigh brought all mankind under his dominion when Christ came. <span class="cmt_word">His oppressor</span>; literally, <span class="accented">his task-master -</span> the same word which is used of the Egyptian taskmasters in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">As in the day of Midian.</span> The "day of Midian" is probably the time of Israel's deliverance from the Midianite oppression by Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto us a child is born</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14-16</a>, where the promise of "a child," "a son," is first made - a child who was, like this Child, to be "God with us"). <span class="cmt_word">The government shall be upon his shoulder.</span> The word translated "government" (<span class="accented">misrah</span>) occurs only here and in ver. 7. It is probably to be connected with <span class="accented">sat</span>, "prince," and Israel. Government was regarded as a burden, to be born on the back or shoulders, and was sometimes symbolized by a key laid upon the shoulder (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-22.htm">Isaiah 22:22</a>). Vizier means "burdened." The Latin writers often speak of the civil power as borne on the shoulders of magistrates (Cic., 'Orat. pro Flacc,' &sect; 95; Plin., 'Paneg.,' &sect; 10). As God, our Lord governed all things from the beginning; as man, he set up a "kingdom" which he still governs - upon the earth. <span class="cmt_word">His name shall be called.</span> It is perhaps not very important whether we view what follows as one name or several. Isaiah does not really mean that the "Child" should bear <span class="accented">as</span> a name, or names, any of the expressions, but only that they should be truly applicable to him. <span class="cmt_word">Wonderful, Counselor</span>. It has been proposed to unite these two expressions and translate, "Wondrous Counselor" (compare "wonderful in counsel," <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-29.htm">Isaiah 28:29</a>). But Dr. Kay is probably right in saying that, if this had been the meaning, it would have been expressed differently. Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Delitzsch, and Vance Smith agree with Dr. Kay in taking the words separately. <span class="accented">Wonderful</span>. The Messiah would be "wonderful" in his nature as God-Man; in his teaching, which "astonished" those who heard it (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>); in his doings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-1.htm">Isaiah 25:1</a>); in the circumstances of his birth and death; in his resurrection, and in his ascension. "Wonder" would be the first sentiment which his manifestation would provoke, and hence this descriptive epithet is placed first. As the Word, as Wisdom itself, as he who says, "Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am Understanding" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-14.htm">Proverbs 8:14</a>), he is well named "Counselor." None will ever seek his counsel in vain, much less repent of following it. <span class="cmt_word">The mighty God</span>; rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">Mighty God</span>; but the difference is not great, since <span class="accented">El</span>, God, contains within itself the notion of singularity, which is given to ordinary nouns by the article. The term <span class="accented">El</span>, God, had been previously applied to the Messiah only in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. It denotes in Isaiah always (as Mr. Cheyne observes) "divinity in an absolute sense; it is never used hyperbolically or metaphorically." <span class="cmt_word">The Everlasting Father</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Everlasting</span> or <span class="accented">Eternal Father</span>. But here, again, there is a singularity in the idea, which makes the omission of the article unimportant; for how could there be more than one Everlasting Father, one Creator, Preserver, Protector of mankind who was absolutely eternal? If the term "Father," applied to our Lord, grates on our ears, we must remember that the distinction of Persons in the Godhead had not yet been revealed. <span class="cmt_word">The Prince of Peace</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Prince of Peace</span>. A "Prince of Peace" had been long shadowed forth, as in Melchizedek, "King of Salem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "of Peace;" and again in Solomon, "the peaceful one;" and Isaiah himself had already prophesied the peacefulness of the Messiah's kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>). Compare the song of the angels at our Lord's birth (<a href="../../par/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a>). If the peacefulness has not vet very clearly shown itself, the reason would seem to be that our Lord's kingdom has yet to come into the hearts of most men.

The remainder of this chapter, together with the first four verses of the next, seems to have formed originally a distinct and separate prophecy. The passage is a poem in four stanzas, with the same refrain at the end of each: "For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still." A somewhat early date has been assigned to the prophecy, as; for instance, "some period in the reign of Jotham" (Cheyne); but the internal evidence only proves that it was written before the destruction of Samaria by the Assyrians. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jacob... Israel.</span> These words do not show that the prophecy is directed against the kingdom of Israel only. "Jacob" designates Judah rather than Israel in <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3, 5, 6</a>; and the expression, "both the houses of Israel," in <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>, shows that the term "Israel" embraces both kingdoms.

"Against him" means "against Ephraim," or the kingdom of Israel.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-20.htm">Isaiah 9:20</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall snatch</span>; rather, one <span class="accented">shall devour</span>. A man, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, shall plunder and ravage in one quarter, and yet not be satisfied; then he shall do the same in another, and still desire more. "Increase of appetite shall grow by what it feeds on." There shall be no sense of satiety anywhere. <span class="cmt_word">The flesh of his own arm.</span> In a civil war, or a time of anarchy, each man is always "eating the flesh of his own arm" - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> injuring his neighbor, who is his own natural protector and defender. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/isaiah/9-21.htm">Isaiah 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: <i>and</i> they together <i>shall be</i> against Judah.

It is not to be supposed that civil discord was confined to them. Probably there was a general disorganization. Still, all the tribes would at any time willingly unite "together against Judah" (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-6.htm">2 Chronicles 28:6-8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../isaiah/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Isaiah 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../isaiah/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Isaiah 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
