He at once "sat down astonied" (ver. 8). So he remained until preparations began to be made for the evening sacrifice, when he arose, and took up a position directly in front of the altar and the holy place, towards which he proceeded to pray. Doubtless he had in his mind the words of Solomon, assented to by God (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>), and pleaded by Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-9.htm">2 Chronicles 20:9</a>): "What prayer and supplication be made by any man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, <span class="accented">and spread forth his hands towards this place</span>: then hear thou in heaven  thy dwelling-place, and forgive, and do," etc. (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-38.htm">1 Kings 8:38, 39</a>).

Shechaniah probably held that marriages made contrary to the law were not merely wrongful, but invalid. At any rate, since the law of Moses, as interpreted by the Rabbis, allowed divorce "for every cause" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3</a>), the remedy suggested was feasible, though scarcely one which the civil power could enforce. <span class="cmt_word">And such as are born of them.</span> "Filii matrem sequuntur" was a maxim of Roman, and, apparently, also of Jewish law.

Matters having reached this point, the covenant having been made, and the only question remaining for consideration being how the decision come to should be carried out, Ezra "rose up," and withdrew himself for a time from the people, entering into one of the side chambers of the temple, and secluding himself there. The guilt of his brethren still pressed heavily on his spirit, and he continued the mourning which he had commenced as soon as it came to his ears. To this mourning he now joined a fast of the strictest kind, an entire abstinence both from eating and drinking, like that of Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>). Natural piety seems to have taught men generally (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-7</a>), and the Jews among them, that such abstinence was a fitting accompaniment of penitential prayer, and might be counted on to lend it additional force with Almighty God. Compare the private and personal fasts of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>), Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>), Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-3.htm">Daniel 9:3</a>), and Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and <i>when</i> he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">chamber of Johanan.</span> On the temple chambers see comment on Ezra 8:29. Johanan appears by <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22, 23</a>, compared with vers. 10-11, to have been really the grandson of Eliashib, who, as high priest, would have the right of assigning him a chamber in the temple (compare <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I did eat no bread nor drink water</span>. Strict fasts of this kind had been observed by Moses twice (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a>, and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>), and by the Ninevites (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a>), but they were very uncommon. Usually it was considered enough to abstain from eating (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-34.htm">1 Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>). Sometimes the person who fasted merely abstained from "meat and wine, and <span class="accented">pleasant</span> bread (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). Ezra's great earnestness appears in the severity of his fast, which (it is to be remembered) was not for his own sins, but for those of his brethren. PROCLAMATION MADE, SUMMONING ALL THE JEWS TO JERUSALEM (vers. 7- 9). After due deliberation between Ezra, the princes, and the elders (ver. 8), it was resolved, as a first step, to summon all Jews  - or, rather, all those who had returned from the captivity, whether they were Jews or Israelites - to Jerusalem, in order that the decision come to with respect to the mixed marriages might be communicated to them. The limit of three days was fixed as the latest date at which any one might make his appearance, and absentees were threatened with the heavy penalties of excommunication and forfeiture of all their possessions. Proclamation having been made to this effect "throughout Judah" (ver. 7), there was a gathering of all the males of full age to Jerusalem within the prescribed time. The place of meeting was the great court of the temple (ver. 9). According to Hecataeus of Abdera (Fr. 14), this was "a stone-walled enclosure, about 500 feet long and 150 feet wide," which might perhaps afford sitting room for 20,000 men. Deducting the aged and infirm, the sick, and those between twelve and twenty years of age, the country Jews would scarcely have reached this number.

ADDRESS OF EZRA, AND CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE TO PUT AWAY THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 10- 14). Hitherto Ezra seems to have allowed the leading part in the matter to be taken by the civil authorities, whom he had found established in Jerusalem on his arrival (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1-8</a>). Now he came forward boldly, denouncing the sin committed, and as supreme governor commanding the repudiation of the strange wives. The assembled multitude consented, but urged that the matter required time; that the season was unsuitable for a prolonged stay of the whole body of country Jews at Jerusalem, and that the business would be most conveniently carried through by a standing commission consisting of the chief authorities of the city of Jerusalem, who should take the case of each country town separately, and, in conjunction with the elders and judges of each town, investigate the alleged mixed marriages of each locality, and adjudicate upon them. By this arrangement the bulk of the country Jews would be allowed at once to return home; and the case of each locality being taken separately, only a small number would at any given time be suffering the inconvenience of a compulsory absence from their residences, and the expense of a stay of some duration in the capital. The proposal was reasonable, and it appears to have approved itself to Ezra and his advisers, and to have been at once adopted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/10-10.htm">Ezra 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ezra the priest stood up</span>. Now that the time had come for action, Ezra was not wanting to his duties. The chief authority had been put into his hands by the Persian king (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-25.htm">Ezra 7:25, 26</a>), and he was bound to exercise it. Accordingly, the great bulk of the nation being assembled in obedience to the proclamation, Ezra came forward in person, and declared that the "strange wives" must be put away. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have taken strange wives</span>. Literally, "have caused to dwell," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have made them come and live with you in the holy land. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make confession</span>. This is undoubtedly the true meaning of <span class="accented">t'nu thodah</span> in this place, and not "<span class="accented">give</span> praise" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), as the LXX. render. <span class="cmt_word">Separate yourselves from the people of the land</span>. The marriages naturally led on to familiar intercourse with the relatives and friends of the women, and so tended to break down the barrier between Jew and Gentile which it had been the special object of the Mosaic legislation to erect. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/10-12.htm">Ezra 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do.</div><div class="comm">

OPPOSITION OF JONATHAN AND OTHERS (ver. 15). It was natural that some opposition should manifest itself when so trenchant a measure was announced as that which Ezra had declared to be necessary. To compel men to divorce their wives was to touch many in the tenderest place. Nor was it difficult to bring forward very plausible arguments to show that the marriages - or at any rate some of them - were allowable. Joseph had married an Egyptian (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>), Moses a Midianite (<a href="../../par/exodus/2-21.htm">Exodus 2:21</a>). True, these marriages had taken place before the law was given; but subsequently, also, Boaz had married Ruth the Moabitess (<a href="../../par/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>); David had taken to wife Maacah, a Geshurite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>); and Solomon had without blame married the daughter of a Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>). These examples might be pleaded in proof that the Law admitted of exceptions, and individuals might argue that their cases were of an exceptional character. Again, in some instances the foreign wives may have become proselytes, and the children may have been circumcised, and so accepted into the congregation; which would give them a claim to remain, which would extend in some degree to the mothers. We therefore cannot be surprised that an opposition was made. Rather, it is remarkable that it was so slight, only extending (so far as appears) to four persons, and so easily quelled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/10-15.htm">Ezra 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this <i>matter</i>: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only Jonathan...  and Jaha-ziah...  were employed about this matter.</span> If this were the true meaning of the passage it would contradict the next verse, by which it appears that Ezra himself, together with several "chiefs of the fathers" - probably identical with the "rulers and elders" of ver. 14 - took the matter in hand, and were occupied with it for three months. The true meaning of the clause, however, is almost certainly that which was assumed in the preceding paragraph: "Only Jonathan and Jahaziah <span class="accented">stood up against</span> this matter," or "<span class="accented">opposed"</span> it (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a>, where the same expression has the sense of "oppose, resist"). <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span> <span class="cmt_word">and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.</span> The "Meshullam" intended is perhaps the person of the name mentioned in ver. 29 as having married an idolatrous wife. The others seem not to have had any personal interest in thwarting Ezra and preventing the reform. SETTLEMENT OF THE WHOLE MATTER BY THE REPUDIATION OF THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 16, 17). The opposition made did not delay the business more than a few days. The great assembly had been held on the twentieth day of the ninth month. On the first day of the tenth month, little more than a week later, the commission for examining into the matter met under the presidency of Ezra, and commenced proceedings. The method of proceeding suggested at the great meeting was no doubt followed. The case of each city was taken separately. Its male inhabitants of full age attended, and its "elders" and "judges" sat on the commission as assessors while the conjugal position of their townsfolk was being investigated. Where a "mixed marriage" was proved the wife was repudiated. In 112 cases the necessity of repudiation was made out to the satisfaction of the commission, and this number of wives was put away. Probably the entire number of cases adjudicated upon was very much greater, since the commission continued at work for three months, and probably sat on seventy-five different days, judging (we may presume) three or four cases a day. On the whole, the small extent to which the evil had prevailed is remarkable; for 112 mixed marriages in a population where the adult males were about 40,000 would give only one such marriage to three hundred or three hundred and fifty legitimate ones. Nevertheless, evils in a community are not to be judged simply by their prevalence. Great evils must be checked at once, even though they have not extended far, lest, if they spread at all widely, they become irremediable. Ezra is to be commended for having perceived the greatness of the peril, and for having taken prompt and decided measures to check it, without waiting till it had got to a head, and so become uncontrollable.

Deducting Sabbaths, the number of days in the three months would be seventy-five or seventy-six; but it is of course possible that the court did not sit continuously. THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO HAD MARRIED THE STRANGE WIVES (vers. 18-44). Aware of the danger that the nation might relapse into the sin which he was seeking to root out, Ezra punishes the wrong-doers by placing their names on record, that others might fear to do the like. He assigns the first place in his catalogue of offenders to the priests, doubtless because in them the sin was greatest; they, as the special custodians of the Law, were most bound to have observed the Law. Next to the priests he puts the Levites, on the same principle, because of their semi-sacerdotal character. He then concludes with the laymen, arranged under their several families. By the list of laymen it appears that ten only out of some thirty-six lay families were implicated in the sin. Three of the four priestly families, on the other hand, and even the near-kindred of the high priest, were among the guilty. It is remarkable that it is Ezra, a priest, and one by many accused of over-sacerdotalism, who gives this testimony against his own order.

Cyrus the Great became King of Persia by his final defeat and capture of Astyages, in  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span> probably. His conquest of Babylon was, comparatively speaking, late in his reign (Herod., Xenoph.), and is fixed by the Canon of Ptolemy to  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He took the city on the night of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a>), when Daniel had just been appointed to the third place in the kingdom (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 29), and was practically at the head of affairs. Thus the great king and the great prophet of the time were brought into contact, and naturally conferred together, as may be gathered from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1). <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by</span> <span class="cmt_word">the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled</span>. The reference is to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12</a>, and Jeremiah 29:10. Jeremiah had prophesied not only the fact, but the date of the return, by assigning to the captivity a duration of "seventy years." There might be some doubt when exactly this term would run out, since the year of 360 was in prophetic use no less than the year of 365 days ('Dict. of the Bible,' s.v. YEAR), and, moreover, the exact date of the commencement of the captivity admitted of question; but Daniel appears to have calculated in  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> that the term was approaching its termination (see <a href="../../par/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2-19</a>). If the captivity were regarded as commencing in the third year of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1, 2</a>), which was  <span class="date">B.C. 606-605</span>, and if years of 360 days were regarded as intended, this would clearly be so, since 360 x 70   =   25,200, and 365 &times; 68   =   24,820, so that in  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span> only another year was wanting. For the prophecy to be fulfilled, it was requisite that the first steps towards bringing about the return and the cessation of desolation should not be delayed beyond the close of  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span>, accordingly, in this year <span class="cmt_word">stirred up the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia</span>. As God in earlier times had worked on the minds of Abimelech (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) and Balaam (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5, 16</a>), and more recently of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a>), so now, it would seem, he directly influenced the heart and will of Cyrus. This is the less surprising, as Cyrus was, in the Divine counsels, fore-ordained to do this work, and had been raised to his high station for the purpose (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1-4</a>). Cyrus was thus induced to make a <span class="cmt_word">proclamation</span> (literally, "to make to pass a voice") throughout the whole kingdom, which reached from the AEgean Sea to the borders of India, and from the Caucasus to the Persian Gulf, and even to <span class="cmt_word">put it in writing</span>, <span class="accented">b</span> <span class="accented">miktab</span>, that so it might be sure to become generally known. Writing was probably of recent introduction into Persia; but there is positive evidence in the native remains of its use by Cyrus. His proclamation was probably issued in at least two languages, Persian and Chaldee.

The use of the term "Jehovah," instead of Ormuzd, is remarkable, and was probably limited to the Hebrew transcript of the proclamation. <span class="cmt_word">Hath given me all</span> <span class="cmt_word">the kingdoms of the earth.</span> An acknowledgment that they have received and hold their royal power from Ormuzd is universal on the part of all the Persian kings who have left inscriptions of any length; but they do not often indulge in such a hyperbole as this of Cyrus. Artaxerxes Ochus, however, calls himself "king of this world" (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inser.,' vol. 1. p. 341). The mention of the "kingdoms of the earth" is appropriate, since Cyrus had not inherited his empire, but built it up by the conquest of a vast number of independent states ('Herod.' 1. <span class="accented">passim</span>). His earn feeling that God had in all cases given him the victory harmonizes with the statement of Isaiah in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem</span>.

He himself, Jehovah-Elohim, has given it me in charge to build him a house. Most critics rightly explain by referring to <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, and accepting the statement of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11:1) that the passage was shown to Cyrus shortly after his capture of Babylon. He understood the prophecy as a command, and proceeded to obey it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is in Judah</span>. The addition of this clause marks strongly the oblivion into which the ruined city had fallen. Apparently, it was necessary, to recall its situation to men's minds by an express mention of the province whereof it had been the capital. Note the repetition of the clause in the next verse.

Gozan and Media, to which the ten tribes had been transported by the Assyrian monarchs, were within his dominions no less than Babylonia.

A pious wish, almost a blessing, indicative of the deep religious feeling and great goodness of heart which characterized Cyrus alone of Persian monarchs. Among the Greeks, AEschylus, who first speaks of him, calls him kindly" or "gracious" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); Herodotus says he ruled his subjects like a father; Xenophon makes him a model prince; Plutarch observes that "in wisdom and virtue and greatness of soul he excelled all other kings;" Diodorus ascribes to him a remarkable power of self-command, together with good feeling and gentleness. The Latin writers, Cicero and others, add their meed of praise; and altogether it may be said that, so far as the evidence reaches, no nobler character appears in ancient history. The Scriptural notices, whether in this book or in Isaiah, are in remarkable accord. <span class="cmt_word">Let him go up</span>. Jerusalem was on a much higher level than Babylon, and the travellers would consequently have to ascend considerably. <span class="cmt_word">And build</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house.</span> The "charge" to Cyrus did not require him to take a personal share in the building. He was simply to "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). He is therefore content to assign the actual work to others. <span class="cmt_word">He is the God</span>. The Septuagint and the Vulgate attach the last clause of the verse to these words, and render "He is the God who is in Jerusalem," which greatly weakens the force of the expression. According to this punctuation, Cyrus makes Jehovah a mere local Deity; according to the far preferable arrangement of the A. V., he declares emphatically that Jehovah is the one true God, beside whom there is no other.

Again, the kindliness of his disposition is apparent. <span class="cmt_word">Beside the freewill offering</span>. So the Septuagint; but the Vulgate has, "<span class="accented">Except</span> the freewill offering," etc. The Septuagint and the A. V. are right. Cyrus means that money, cattle, and goods are to be made over to the poorer Israelites, <span class="accented">in addition</span> to any offering that might be intrusted to them for conveyance to Jerusalem, either by himself or by his subjects. Individually, he was about to send "a freewill offering," consisting of a number of gold and silver vessels for the service of the temple.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mithredath the treasurer.</span> Not "Mithridates, the son of Gazabar," as the Vulgate renders.

It means either "<span class="accented">given</span> by Mithra" or "<span class="accented">dedicated</span> to Mithra," and is distinct evidence of the worship of Mithra by the Persians as early as the time of Cyrus. Mithra was the sun, and was venerated as Mitra by the early Vedic Indians. His worship in later Persia is clearly established; but, except for the name of Mithredath in this place, it would have been doubtful whether he was as yet an object of religious veneration to the Iranians. <span class="cmt_word">Sheshbazzar</span>. It is generally allowed that this was the Chaldaean or court name of Zerubbabel. (The chief evidence of this is to be found in <a href="../../par/ezra/5-16.htm">Ezra 5:16</a> compared with <a href="../../par/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>.)

He appears to have been adopted by Salathiel as his son, and to have been recognized as the legitimate heir to the throne of David. Thus he did not owe his appointment to the mere favour of Cyrus, but was the natural leader of the people.

The twelve are reasonably regarded as either the actual heads of the twelve tribes, or at any rate as representing them. Notwithstanding the small number among the returned exiles who belonged to other tribes than those of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi, there was a manifest wish on the part of the chiefs to regard the return as in some sort that of all the tribes (see <a href="../../par/ezra/2-70.htm">Ezra 2:70</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-17.htm">Ezra 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The number of the men</span>.

As "Shesh-bazzar" was the Babylonian name of Zerub-babel (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-8.htm">Ezra 1:8</a>), so "the Tirshatha" seems to have been his Persian title. The word is probably a participial form from <span class="accented">tars</span> or <span class="accented">tarsa</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> fear," and means literally "the Feared."

The doubt whether the families of Habaiah and Coz (or Haccoz) belonged to the priestly class or no might then be resolved. But Zerubbabel's expectation was disappointed. The gift of Urim and Thum-mira, forfeited by disobedience, was never recovered.

The three authorities agree, however, in their summation, all alike declaring that the actual number of those who returned with Zerubbabel was 42,360. Esdras adds that children under twelve years of age are not included. If this were so, the entire number must have exceeded 50,000 - an enormous body of persons to transport a distance of above a thousand miles, according to Western experience, but one which will not surprise those acquainted with the East. In the East caravans of from ten to twenty thousand souls often traverse huge distances without serious mishap, and migrations frequently take place on a much grander scale. In the year 1771, 50,000 families of Torgouths, reckoned to number 300,000 souls, arrived on the frontiers of China, after a journey of 10,000 leagues through a most difficult country, and were given lands in the Chinese empire. They were followed in the next year by 180,000 Eleuths and others, who had accomplished a similar distance (see De Hell, 'Travels,' pp. 228, 229). Jenghis Khan is said to have forced 100,000 artisans and craftsmen to emigrate in a body from Khiva into Mongolia (Howarth's 'History of the Mongols,' p. 85). The transplantation of entire nations was an established practice among the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. THE NUMBER OF THE SLAVES, HORSES, MULES, CAMELS, AND ASSES OF THOSE WHO RETURNED (vers, 65-67). It may seem strange that matters of this trivial character should be recorded with such exactness in Holy Writ; but enumerations similar in character are not unfrequent (see <a href="../../par/genesis/23-14.htm">Genesis 23:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/42-12.htm">Job 42:12</a>). They may perhaps be viewed as teaching the lesson that with God nothing is too trivial for exact knowledge, even "all the hairs of our head" being "numbered" (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-30.htm">Matthew 10:30</a>). In the present passage the enumeration is not altogether without a further historical value, since it is indicative of the general poverty and low estate of the returning exiles, who had but one slave and one ass to every six of their number, one horse to every sixty, one camel to every hundred, and one mule to every one hundred and seventy-five.

It has been customary among the pious of all ages and countries to make thank-offerings to the Almighty on the accomplishment of any important or dangerous work. The long journey of the exiles from Babylonia to Jerusalem involved considerable risk (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-22.htm">Ezra 8:22, 31</a>), and its successful termination naturally called forth their gratitude. The character of the offerings made is indicative of the fact, otherwise probable, that the exiles had turned all that they possessed into money, and had brought to Jerusalem a considerable amount of coin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/2-68.htm">Ezra 2:68</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>some</i> of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the house of the LORD which <i>is</i> at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 68.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Some of the chief of the fathers.</span> That is, "Some of the heads of families."

This was a gold coin, stamped with the figure of a Persian king, wearing his crown, and armed with a bow and arrow. According to the most exact computation, each such coin contained somewhat more pure gold than an English guinea, and was worth &pound;1 1s. 10.5d. of our money. The 61,000 darics would therefore have been equal to &pound;66,718 15s. <span class="cmt_word">Five</span> <span class="cmt_word">thousand pounds of silver.</span> The word translated "pound" is <span class="accented">maneh</span>, an equivalent of the Greek tuna and the Latin mind.

The value of the Hebrew silver <span class="accented">munch</span> is uncertain, but probably was not very different from the Greek. Thus the sum contributed in silver may be estimated at above &pound;20,000, and the entire contribution at nearly &pound;90,000. It must be noted, however, that Nehemiah's estimate (Nehemiah 7:71, 72) is less. <span class="cmt_word">One hundred priests' garments.</span> Nehemiah says ninety-seven (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 70, 72), whence we may conclude that Ezra uses a round number.

The name Jeshua is a mere variant of Joshua, and so corresponds to Jesus, of whom Jeshua may be regarded as a type. <span class="cmt_word">His brethren</span> <span class="cmt_word">the priests.</span> As being all of them equally descended from Aaron, the priests were "brethren." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel</span>.

This was done, no doubt, to indicate that the religion which the exiles brought back from Babylon was in every respect identical with that which they had possessed before they were carried thither. Many moderns hold the contrary; but it has not yet been proved that the sojourn at Babylon modified the religious ideas of the Jews in any important particular. <span class="cmt_word">For fear was upon them.</span> Or, "<span class="accented">though</span> fear was upon them." Notwithstanding their fear of the surrounding nations, they set up the altar. We must remember that their neighbours were not Persians, but descendants of various idolatrous nations  -  Hamathites, Babylonians, Susianians, Elamites, Cuthaeans, etc. - bitterly opposed to anything like a pure spiritual religion (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9, 10</a>). Though the exiles had permission from Cyrus to raise up not only their altar, but their temple, it was not at all certain that his nominal subjects would passively submit. It was as if a modern Turkish Sultan should decree the erection of a Christian altar and a grand Christian cathedral at Kerbela or Bussorah, towards the verge of his empire. There would be great danger in acting on such a decree. <span class="cmt_word">Burnt offerings morning and evening</span>. So the law required (see <a href="../../par/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38, 39</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3, 4</a>). CELEBRATION OF THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES (ver. 4). Emboldened by their successful restoration of the altar of burnt sacrifice, Zerubbabel and Jeshua allowed the people to gather themselves together and celebrate the autumnal festival, though they can scarcely have made it on this occasion a "feast of ingathering." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as <i>it is</i> written, and <i>offered</i> the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As it is written</span>.

The offerings for each day of the festival are carefully laid down in <a href="../../par/numbers/29-13.htm">Numbers 29:13-38</a>. We must understand that all the particulars there enjoined were carefully observed. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DAILY SACRIFICE, THE SET FEASTS, AND THE OFFERING OF FREE-WILL OFFERINGS (vers. 5, 6). Having set up the altar, and celebrated the particular festival which the revolving year happened to have brought round, and which it would have been wrong to neglect, the exiles re-established permanently three things: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The daily sacrifice; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The celebration of the new moons and other regular feasts; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The practice of allowing the people to bring offerings whenever they pleased, to be offered on the great altar by the priest or priests in attendance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first of these was for atonement; the second for public thanksgiving and acknowledgment of God's mercies; the third for private devotion, the payment of vows, and the like. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-5.htm">Ezra 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">And afterward <i>offered</i> the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The continual burnt</span> <span class="cmt_word">offering.</span> This is beyond a doubt the daily morning and evening sacrifice, called "the continual burnt offering" in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3-6</a>.

The returned exiles kept henceforth regularly both the daily morning and evening sacrifice, and also that appointed for the new moons (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>), and those appointed for the other "set feasts,"such as the passover and the feast of Pentecost. <span class="cmt_word">And of every one that willingly</span> <span class="cmt_word">offered.</span> Nor was this all. The practice was resumed of sacrificing on the great altar at any time any free-will offerings that individual Israelites might bring (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1, 2, 3</a>, etc.). Thus provision was made for all that was most essential in the ritual of religion, while the temple itself still remained unbuilt (see ver. 6). PREPARATION OF MATERIALS FOR THE REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE (ver. 7). When the restoration of religion had pro-greased thus far, the civil and ecclesiastical rulers turned their attention to that object which had been specially mentioned in the "decree of Cyrus" (<a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>), the rebuilding of the temple. And, first of all, it was necessary to collect building materials, wood and stone, which were the chief materials of the first temple, and which Cyrus had particularized in a supplementary decree (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-4.htm">Ezra 6:4</a>) as those to be employed in the construction of the second. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/3-6.htm">Ezra 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not <i>yet</i> laid.</div><div class="comm">

Consequently, among those who returned there were many masons and carpenters. These were now set to work by Zerubbabel, and received their wages in money. <span class="cmt_word">And meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre.</span> The Phoenicians, on the other hand, received their wages in kind. As Phoenicia was a narrow strip of country, and grew but little corn, it had always to depend mainly for its supplies of food on its neighbours, and generally drew the greater part from Palestine (see <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Hiram had furnished materials to Solomon for the first temple on condition of receiving wheat, barley, wine, and oil (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-15.htm">2 Chronicles 2:15</a>). Zerubbabel made a similar arrangement at the present time with the Tyrians and Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">To bring</span> <span class="cmt_word">cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa.</span> Having cut the timber in the mountains, the Phoenicians conveyed it to the coast, perhaps sometimes letting it pass down the rivers, and, collecting it on the coast into large rafts or "flotes" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-16.htm">2 Chronicles 2:16</a>), took these by sea to the roadstead of Joppa (Jaffa). Hence it was conveyed by land a distance of thirty-five miles to Jerusalem. Lebanon cedar was in great request in the East, and appears to have been cut and carried off both by the Egyptians and the Assyrians. The forests must in the ancient times have been far more extensive than at present. <span class="cmt_word">According to the grant that they had of Cyrus.</span> A special grant of Phoenician timber, made by Cyrus, seems to be intended. Though Cyrus had not conquered Phoenicia ('Herod.,' 3:34), he might regard his conquest of Babylon as involving the submission of what had for some time been a Babylonian dependency. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 3:8-13 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&sect; 3. REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE AND OPPOSITION MADE TO IT. LAYING OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE TEMPLE AND CEREMONIAL ON THE OCCASION (vers. 8-13). Seven months were occupied with preparations. The winter was past, and the spring had arrived. It was the second month, Zif, the month of "blossom," corresponding to our May - the same month in which Solomon had laid the foundation of the first temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>) - when Zerubbabel judged that the time had come for commencing the foundation of the second. The correspondence of the month was no doubt intentional, like the correspondence of the foundations of the altar (ver. 3), and was to mark that all was to be as before, that nothing was to be wantonly changed. Zerubbabel and Jeshua presided; but to Zerubbabel is assigned the chief part in the work. "The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house" are the words of God himself to Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>). It was arranged that the work should commence with a religious ceremonial, natural piety here suggesting what was not recorded of the "first house," though it may have occurred and not have been put on record. The ceremonial consisted chiefly of praise, and was accompanied with sacred music, according to the pattern set by David and Solomon in their sacred processions and ceremonies (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>, etc.). Their special parts in it were assigned beforehand to the priests, the Levites, and the people.

The musical service of Zerubbabel fell short of the "ordinance of David," since it comprised neither psalteries nor harps, which were an essential part of David's system. Apparently, the musical skill of the Levites had declined under the depressing circumstances of the captivity (see <a href="../../par/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>).

In this case the Artaxerxes of the next verse is taken to be Artaxerxes Longimanus, and the entire passage, from ver. 6 to ver. 23 inclusively, is regarded as parenthetic, having reference to events which happened later than any of those recorded in ch. 6. But the evident <span class="accented">nexus</span> of vers. 23, 24 is fatal to this view, which has nothing in its favour beyond the sequence of the royal names, an uncertain argument in this instance, since we know that Persian kings had often more than one name. If on these grounds we reject the proposed identification, and regard the chapter as chronologically consecutive, Ahasuerus here must be explained as Cambyses, and the Artaxerxes of ver. 7 as Smerdis.

If Artaxerxes be the Pseudo-Smerdis, we can readily understand why an application was not made to him at once, and how it came about that the Jews recommenced their building, as they appear from vers. 12, 13 to have done. The Pseudo-Smerdis was a usurper; his reign was a time of partial anarchy; in a distant part of the empire it would not be known for a while who was king. Men would be thrown on themselves, and would do as it seemed good in their own eyes. Later, there may have been some doubt whether a king, who was known to be a religious reformer, would follow the policy of his predecessor with respect to the Jews, or reverse it. Hence a delay, and then a more formal application than before for a positive decree to stop the building (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The rest of their companions</span>.

Herodotus tells us that in every Persian province the governor had a secretary attached to him, who was appointed by the crown, and acted as a check upon his nominal master (Herod., 3:128). The position assigned to Shim-shai in this chapter (see especially vers. 9, 17, 23) is such as might be expected under these circumstances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then <i>wrote</i> Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, <i>and</i> the Elamites,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Dinaites</span>, etc. It is curious that the Samaritans, instead of using a general appellation, describe themselves under the names of the various nations and cities which had furnished the colonists of whom they were the descendants. It would seem that they were not yet, in the time of the Pseudo-Smerdis, amalgamated into a single people. From the list of names we may gather that the colonists of Esar-haddon's time had been derived chiefly from Southern Babylonia and the adjacent regions of Susiana, Persia, and Elymais. The Babylonians, Susanchites, and Elamites speak for themselves, and require no explanation. The Archevites are the people of Ereeh or Orchoe (now Warka), a city to the south-east of Babylon. The Apharsites are no doubt Persians; the Dehavites, Dai or Dahae, a tribe located in Persia Proper ('Herod.,' 1:125). If uncertainty attaches to any of the names, it is to two only - the Dinaites and the Tarpelites. Of these, the Dinaites are probably the people of Dayan, a country bordering on Cilicia, whose inhabitants are often mentioned by the Assyrian monarchs. The Tarpelites have been regarded as the people of Tripolis; but it is improbable that that city had as yet received its Greek name. Perhaps they are the Tuplai, or people of Tubal, mentioned in Scripture and the Assyrian inscriptions, the letter <span class="accented">r</span> being a euphonic addition, as in Darmesek for Dammesek <span class="accented">sharbith</span> for <span class="accented">shebeth</span>, and the like.

There had been one, or perhaps two, previous revolts from Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>); but of these the Samaritans probably knew nothing. They would, however, be likely to know that before Nebuchadnezzar took the extreme measure of removing the Jews from their own land to Babylon, they had rebelled against him three several times - once under Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a>), once under his son Jehoiachin (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 10), and once under Zedekiah, the last king (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 20). Thus they had a basis of truth on which to ground their charge that Jerusalem was "the rebellious and the bad city." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">have set up the walls thereof.</span> It appears very clearly from the book of Nehemiah that the walls of Jerusalem were not restored till his time, seventy-five years after this. The Samaritans, however, would naturally exaggerate, and call the rebuilding of the temple, and of a certain number of dwelling-houses, a fortifying of the place. The exaggeration, however, is not so great in the Chaldee text as in the Authorized Version. What is said seems to be, that "they <span class="accented">are setting up the walls and joining the foundations."</span> That the work was far from complete is admitted in the next verse. We may doubt whether it was really begun.

In Greece, if a subject city set to work to fortify itself, rebellion was immediately anticipated, not unfairly. But the circumstances of the Persian empire were different. In the remoter parts of that empire the central government was weak, and disorders frequently occurred. A city might need fortifications to protect it against its immediate neighbours, when it had not the slightest intention of asserting independence. Judging from the later history, which shows no revolt of the Jews against Persia, we may say that the accusation now alleged was unfounded, though perhaps it was not made in bad faith. <span class="cmt_word">Toll</span>, <span class="cmt_word">tribute, and custom</span> represent the chief heads of Persian taxation, which, however, did not include "custom" in our sense of the word. The three terms used by the Samaritans really represent, respectively, "tribute," or the money payment required from each province, "provision," or the payment in kind equally required (Herod., 1:192; 3:91), and "toll," or contributions from those who made use of the Persian highways. According to the Samaritans, none of these would be paid by the Jews if Jerusalem was once fortified. <span class="cmt_word">And so thou shalt endamage the revenue.</span> The general meaning is given correctly enough by this rendering, but "revenue" is not expressly mentioned. <span class="accented">Aphthom</span>, the word so translated, means really "at length," "at last."

The Samaritans suggest a consultation of this book, which would at any rate contain their own previous accusations against Jerusalem (<span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 5, 6), and might make some mention of the revolts from Babylon (see the comment on ver. 12). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">which cause was this city destroyed.</span> This was the great fact on which the Samaritans relied.

Accordingly, he had a search made among the state records, and found, as they had expected he would, evidence of insurrections on the part of the Jews against the foreign countries to which they had been subject, as Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-7.htm">2 Kings 18:7</a>) and Babylon (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 24:1; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>), and also proof of the formidable power possessed by certain Jewish or Israelite kings; upon which he thought himself justified in complying with the Samaritan request, and ordering the work that was going on at Jerusalem to cease (see ver. 21).

By these and similar means the two prophets aroused a spirit of enthusiasm, which caused the work to make rapid progress, and was an invaluable assistance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:3-17 RENEWAL OF OPPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE NEIGHBOURING HEATHEN. LETTER WRITTEN BY THEM AND SENT TO DARIUS (vers. 3-17). Once more opposition showed itself. Tatnai, a high officer, called "governor on this side the river" (ver. 3), perhaps satrap of Syria, and Shethar-boznai, or Sitrabarzanes, a Persian noble probably, at this time took the lead, and learning that the building was making progress, came in person to Jerusalem, and demanded to know by what authority the temple and city were being restored. Zerubbabel seems to have answered, "By the authority of a decree of Cyrus, issued in the year that he became king of Babylon" (ver. 13); whereupon a second question was asked, "What are the names of the men responsible for carrying on the work?" Zerubbabel answered that he was alone responsible, giving his name as Sheshbazzar, and declaring himself to be acting under a commission received from Cyrus (ver. 15), and never revoked. Thereupon Tatnai and Shethar-boznai seem to have proposed a cessation of the building until reference could be made to Darius and his pleasure learnt (ver. 5); but Zerubbabel declined to agree to this, and the work proceeded without intermission (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>). Meanwhile, a letter was written to Darius, not unfairly stating the case, and suggesting that the state archives should be searched for the decree ascribed to Cyrus, that it might be seen what exactly it was that the decree sanctioned, and further that the king should expressly declare what his own pleasure was in the matter (ver. 17). This letter Tatnai, in his capacity of satrap, despatched to the court by special messenger, and so left the business to the decision of Darius and his counsellors, without further seeking to influence him. Remark the strong contrast between this despatch and that of the Samaritans. In the Samaritan letter private pique and enmity show themselves - Jerusalem is "the rebellious and the bad city" (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-12.htm">Ezra 4:12</a>), "<span class="accented">hurtful</span> unto kings and provinces" (<span class="accented">ibid. ver.</span> 15); its intention to revolt is assumed (ver. 13); the king is warned that his dominion and revenue are in danger (ver. 16); no hint is given of there having ever been any such document as the decree of Cyrus; no reference is made to Sheshbazzar or the royal commission that he had received; altogether, the case is stated as strongly as possible against the Jews, with great and manifest unfairness. Here, on the contrary, where the person who takes up the matter is the Persian governor, a dispassionate tone prevails; no charges are made; no abuse uttered; the letter is confined to a statement of facts and an inquiry; the Jews are allowed to give their own account of their proceedings, nearly half the letter being their statement of their own case (vers. 11-15); the decree of Cyrus is brought into prominence, asserted on the one hand, not denied on the other; that it should be searched for is suggested; and finally there is a simple request that the king will declare his will in respect of the building. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/5-3.htm">Ezra 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tatnai</span>, <span class="cmt_word">governor on this side the river</span>.

The etymology is uncertain, but seems not to be Semitic (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' pp. 570-572). The respective rank of Tatnai and Zerub-babel is indicated, not by this term, but by what follows it. Tatnai was <span class="accented">pechah</span> "<span class="accented">be</span>yond the river," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> governor of the whole tract west of the Euphrates; Zerubbabel was <span class="accented">pechah</span> of Judah only. A Greek writer would have called the one "<span class="accented">satrap</span> of Syria," the other "<span class="accented">sub-satrap</span> of Judaea." It was the duty of Tatuai to watch the proceedings of his sub-satraps.

Tatnai and Shethar-boznai followed up their first question by a second, "What are the names of the men that make this building?" (comp. below, vers. 9, 10).

But this expression indicates the contrary. Most probably the satrap of Syria held his court at Damascus. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the great God</span> is a remarkable expression in the mouth of a heathen. It has some parallels, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the expressions of Cyrus in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2, 3</a>, and of Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> and Daniel 3:29; but they were persons who had been brought to the knowledge that Jehovah was the one true God, under very peculiar and miraculous circumstances. Tatnai, on the other hand, represents the mere ordinary Persian official; and his acknowledgment of the God of the Jews as "the great God" must be held to indicate the general belief of the Persians on the subject (see the comment on Ezra 1:2). <span class="cmt_word">Which is builded</span>. Rather, "being builded." <span class="cmt_word">With great stones.</span> Literally, "stones of rolling," which is commonly explained as stones so large that they had to be rolled along the ground. But the squared stones used in building neither were, nor could be, rolled; they are always represented as dragged, generally on a rough sledge. And it is not at all probable that in the "day of small things" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>) the Jews were building with very large stones. The LXX. translate "choice stones;" the Vulgate "unpolished" or "rough stone." Some of the Jewish expositors suggest "marble." <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">timber is laid</span>. A good deal of timber had been employed in the old temple, but chiefly for the floors of chambers (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-10.htm">1 Kings 6:10</a>), for the internal lining of the walls (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> vers. 9, 15), and probably for the roofing. In the new temple, timber seems to have been employed also as the main material of the party-walls. Here again we have a trace of the economy necessary in the "day of small things."

They speak of God as "the God of heaven and earth" - a very rare title - partly in humble acknowledgment of his universal and absolute dominion, as Christians speak when they call God "the Maker of heaven and earth;" partly to impress favourably those to whom they speak, persons accustomed to regard God primarily as the Being who "gave mankind earth and heaven" (Rawlinson's 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. pp. 285, 291, 319, 324, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And build</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/5-12.htm">Ezra 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our</span> <span class="cmt_word">fathers provoked the God of heaven unto wrath</span>.

For centuries, with only short and rare intervals, "the chief of the priests, and the people, had transgressed very much after <span class="accented">all</span> the abominations of the heathen," and had even "polluted the house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon</span>. He punished, as he always does, national apostasy with national destruction. Making an idolatrous people, but a less guilty one, his sword, he cut off Judah, as he had previously cut off Israel, causing the national life to cease, and even removing the bulk of the people into a distant country. Not by his own power or might did Nebuchadnezzar prevail. God could have delivered the Jews from him as easily as he had delivered them in former days from Jabin (<a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2-24</a>), and from Zerah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11-15</a>), and from Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-36</a>). But he was otherwise minded; he "<span class="accented">gave them into the hand</span> of Nebuchadnezzar" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>). He divided their counsels, paralysed their resistance, caused Pharaoh Hophra to desert their cause (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-7.htm">2 Kings 24:7</a>), and left them helpless and unprotected. Nebuchadnczzar was his instrument to chastise his guilty people, and in pursuing his own ends merely worked out the purposes of the Almighty.

Libraries or record chambers were attached to the royal residences under the old Assyrian and Babylonian kings; and the practice was no doubt continued by the Persians. Some of these record offices have been recently found, and their stores recovered. In the year 1850 Mr. Layard came upon the royal library of Asshur-bani-pal at Koyunjik, and obtained from it several hundreds of documents. More recently, in 1875-6, some Arab explorers happened upon a similar collection near Babylon, which yielded from 3000 to 4000 tablets ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 6. pp. 4, 582). It is quite possible that the "decree of Cyrus" may still exist, and be one day recovered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezra/6.htm"><title>Ezra 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezra/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezra/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezra/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezra/5.htm" title="Ezra 5">&#9668;</a> Ezra 6 <a href="../ezra/7.htm" title="Ezra 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-1.htm">Ezra 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Darius the king made a</span> <span class="cmt_word">decree.</span> Rather, "gave an order" (Vulg., <span class="accented">praecepit</span>).

Herodotus says that it was built by Deioces, the first Median king, occupied the centre of the town, and was defended by seven circles of walls, one inside the other (1:98). Polybius states that the building covered an area 1420 yards in circumference, and consisted of a number of halls and cloistered courts, supported by wooden pillars, of cypress or of cedar, both of which were coated with a plating of gold or silver, and supported roofs sloped at an angle, consisting of silver plates instead of the customary tiling (5:27, 10). This grannd building was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and also of Cyrus and Cambyses. Darius built himself still more magnificent residences at Susa and Persepolis; but both he and the later Achaemenian monarchs continued to use the Median palace as a summer residence, and it maintained its celebrity till the close of the empire (see Arrian, 'Exp. Alex.,' 3:19). <span class="cmt_word">A roll</span>. According to Ctesias ('Died. Sic.,' 2:32), the Persians employed parchment or vellum for the material of their records, not baked clay, like the Assyrians and Babylonians, or paper, like the Egyptians.

Public documents were commonly set forth by the Persians in more than one language (see 'Herod.,' 4:87; and comp. the 'Inscriptions,' <span class="accented">passim</span>, which are almost universally either bilingual or trilingual).

It is the future, rather than the past, which Cyrus is contemplating. <span class="cmt_word">Let the foundation thereof be strongly laid</span>. Isaiah had prophesied that Cyrus should "say to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, <span class="accented">Thy foundation shall be laid"</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>). Cyrus adds an injunction that the foundations be laid "supportingly," or "strongly," that so the house may the longer continue. <span class="cmt_word">The height thereof threescore cubits.</span> Half the height of the first temple, according to the existing text of Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a>); but one-third <span class="accented">more</span> than the previous height, as estimated by the author of Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the breadth thereof threescore cubits.</span> This breadth is thrice that of the main building, according to both Chronicles and Kings. It is even double that of the old temple, <span class="accented">with the side chambers</span>, which occupied a space of five cubits, or seven and a half feet, on either wing. That such an enlargement actually took effect would seem to be most improbable; and we may perhaps conclude that Cyrus designed a building on a grander scale than Zerubbabel, with the resources at his disposal, was able to erect. It is curious that Cyrus did not in his decree specify the length of the temple.

But it is perhaps doubtful whether the word <span class="accented">nidbak</span> ever means "storey."

Individual kings must die, but the house would go on (see the speech of Artemisia to Xerxes in 'Herod.,' 8:102; and compare the references to the "gods of the royal house" in the Inscriptions). Kings took special care of their sons. Thus Cyrus sent Cambyses back to Persia when he was about to attack the Massagetae ('Herod.,' 1:208), and Xerxes gave several of his sons into the charge of Artemisia, to convey them by ship to Asia, while he himself took the long and perilous journey by land (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 8:103).

Hence the severity of the punishment threatened. The punishment has been explained as crucifixion, impalement, and "whipping at a post;" but there seems to be no real doubt that crucifixion is intended. Great criminals were almost always crucified by the Persians (see Brisson, 'De Regno Persarum,' 2. pp. 327-329; and comp. 'Behist.

Still the knowledge that the angels of God were interesting themselves in the restoration of the temple (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9-21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>, etc.), and the many promises that God would "comfort Zion," and "choose Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>), and that the temple should assuredly be brought to completion (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a>), helped no doubt to strengthen the hands of Zerubbabel, and to keep up the zeal of the people<span class="cmt_word">. According to the commandment of Cyrus</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia</span>. The commandments of Cyrus and of Darius have been set forth by the writer (see <a href="../../par/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-3.htm">Ezra 6:3-5, 7</a>); but nothing has been said as yet of any commandment given by any Artaxerxes to "build" or "finish" the house. On the contrary, the only Arta-xerxes mentioned has been declared to have expressly forbidden the work to proceed (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-7.htm">Ezra 4:7-22</a>). The Artaxerxes of that place, moreover, reigned between Cyrus and Darius, whereas this Artaxerxes should, by the position of his name, be one of the successors of Darius. It has been suggested that Xerxes is intended, and that he may have been associated with his father during the building of the temple. But as Xerxes was the son of Atossa, whom Darius did not marry until he had ascended the throne (Herod., 3:88), he cannot have been more than five years old when the temple was finished. Nor was he ever associated on the throne by his father. Xerxes, therefore, cannot be meant. The next king to Xerxes, however, who really bore the name of Artaxerxes was a favourer of the Jews, and did give commandment to "beautify," and in that sense "finish," the house of the Lord (see <a href="../../par/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20, 27</a>). We must suppose, therefore, that he is the person intended. The objection that the name is not spelt the same, but has a <span class="accented">samech</span> in one place instead of a <span class="accented">schin</span>, is too minute to require consideration. The Persians themselves spelt the name of Artaxerxes in more ways than one (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persia,' vol. 1. p. 348). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a></div><div class="verse">And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The house was finished on the third day of the month Adar. Haggai</span> (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-15.htm">Haggai 1:15</a>) gives the exact day of the recommencement of the work as the twenty-fourth of Elul in Darius's second year. Ezra here gives the exact day of the completion. From Zerubbabel's laying of the foundation (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-10.htm">Ezra 3:10</a>), the time that had elapsed was twenty-one years. From the recommencement under the inspiriting influence of the two prophets, the time was only four years, five months, and ten days. DEDICATION OF THE SECOND TEMPLE (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-18</a>). Following the example of Solomon, who had solemnly "dedicated" the first temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and had offered on the occasion a sacrifice unexampled for its magnitude in the whole of Jewish history (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), Zerubbabel now, under the advice of two prophets, inaugurated the new building with a similar ceremony. In "the day of small things" it was not possible for him to emulate Solomon's magnificence in respect of the number of victims. Solomon had sacrificed 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. Zerubbabel's means only enabled him to make an offering of 712 animals, more than half of them lambs. He did, however, according to his ability; and God, who accepts all our endeavours according to that we have, and not according to that we have not, was content to receive graciously the humble offering made to him, and to bless the building thus inaugurated with a glory unknown to the first temple. The Lord himself, the Messenger of the covenant, so long sought by his people, suddenly came to this temple (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>) - came to it, and frequented it, and taught in it, and gave it a dignity and a majesty far beyond the first temple, which possessed indeed the Shechinah, but was once, and once only, vouchsafed a brief manifestation of the actual Divine presence (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-1.htm">2 Chronicles 7:1</a>).

We may assume that some of every tribe had returned with Zerubbabel, and that consequently it was possible to regard the re-established people as "Israel" (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-20.htm">Nehemiah 11:20</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-13.htm">Zechariah 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-1.htm">Malachi 1:1</a>); though, since the great majority were Jews, they were more commonly spoken of as "Judah" (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1, 6, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/6-7.htm">Ezra 6:7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-15.htm">Zechariah 8:15</a>, etc.). Zerubbabel, desirous of emphasising the nobler and grander view, made this solemn sin offering of twelve he-goats, one for each of the tribes. Ezra acted similarly when he brought the second colony (<span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>).

This arrangement was based upon the ordinances of the law with respect to the respective offices of the two orders, as given in the Book of Numbers (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-6.htm">Numbers 8:6-26</a>), and, so far, was <span class="cmt_word">according to the writing of the book of Moses.</span> But the "courses" themselves were not established till David's time. CELEBRATION OF THE PASSOVER IN THE ENSUING MONTH, AND OBSERVANCE OF THE FEAST OF UNLEAVENED BREAD (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-19.htm">Ezra 6:19-22</a>). Specially solemn passovers were celebrated on specially solemn occasions; and these received special record at the hands of the sacred writers. Of this kind are the passover celebrated By Hezekiah in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 726</span>, recorded in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30.htm">2 Chronicles 30</a>, and that celebrated by Josiah in  <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>, recorded in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. Both of these followed upon a cleansing of the temple, and restoration of the temple worship after a period of suspension. Ezra seems to place the passover of  <span class="date">B.C. 516</span> in the same category. It marked the period of the full re-establishment of the regular ordinances of religion, more or less interrupted from the time of the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. It terminated the abnormal and commenced the normal condition of things. Perhaps it is to mark this, that Ezra at this point disuses the Chaldee dialect, which he had introduced in ch. 4:8, and returns to the Hebrew, the established language of the Jewish religion.

It would seem that, as in Hezekiah's time, "the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-34.htm">2 Chronicles 29:34</a>).

Perhaps the writer's real intention in this place is to express in a general way the thankfulness of the Jews that God had turned, the hearts of their civil rulers, whether Assyrians, Babylonians, or Persians, from hostility to friendship, having replaced the bitter enmity of Sennacherib and Nebuchadnezzar by the hearty good-will of Cyrus and Darius. On this view, Assyria would represent merely the great power of Western Asia, and "the king" would not be Darius personally, but the lord of Western Asia in a more general way, who by God's goodness had become the permanent friend of Israel instead of her oppressor and enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezra/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezra 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezra 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezra/7.htm"><title>Ezra 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezra/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezra/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezra/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezra/6.htm" title="Ezra 6">&#9668;</a> Ezra 7 <a href="../ezra/8.htm" title="Ezra 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-1.htm">Ezra 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The writer makes a marked division between his first and second sections by means of the words, "<span class="cmt_word">Now after these things</span>," which he uses in this place only.

EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM, WITH DATES (Xerxes 7:6-10). In introducing himself, Ezra seems to regard it 25 of primary importance to state two things  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> who he was, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> what place he had in a history of which the main object is to give an account of the return of Israel from captivity. In connection with the former point, he gives, first of all, his genealogy; and, secondly, the account of himself contained in vers. 6 and 10. He describes himself as "a ready scribe" - one who "had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it," and also "to teach in Israel statutes and judgments." In connection with the latter, he is careful to put before us at once the fact that he too, like Zerubbabel, "went up from Babylon" to Jerusalem by the permission of the Persian king, and, like Zerubbabel, was accompanied by priests, Levites, both singers and porters, Nethinim, and a number of the people (ver. 7). He adds an exact statement as to the date of both his departure and arrival, very natural in one who is his own biographer, and very interesting to the general historian. He also, without any parade of religious sentiment, acknowledges the baud of God as directing, helping, and sustaining him in all his proceedings, ascribing to the Divine favour, especially, Artaxerxes allowance of his journey, and his safe accomplishment of it within a moderate space of time (vers. 6, 9).

It is characteristic of Ezra's piety never to forget that the law was not a mere human code given by an earthly lawgiver, not even a national treasure, the accumulation of centuries, but a direct Divine gift "the law of the Lord" (ver. 10), "the words of the commandments of the Lord, and of his statutes to Israel" (ver. 11), "the law which the Lord had commanded by Moses" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the hand of the Lord his God upon him</span>. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "by reason of God's favour to him."

This was no doubt viewed as an auspicious day for beginning an important undertaking. The time occupied on the way was exactly four months, which is longer than might  have been supposed to be necessary. Herodotus reckoned it a three months journey  from Sardis to Susa (ver. 53), and the  younger Cyrus conducted an army from  Ephesus to Cunaxa, near Babylon, in ninety-  three marching days (Xen, 'Anab' 2 1, &sect; 6) - the distance in either case being considerably more than that from Babylon to Jerusalem, even supposing the route followed to  have been by Balis and Aleppo. But a  caravan, like an army, requires rests; and we  hear of one such rest at Ahava (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15</a>).  Cyrus gave his troops more days of rest than of movement, and took half the year to reach Cunaxa from Ephesus. We need not be surprised, therefore, that Ezra's journey occupied four months. Some delay must almost certainly have been caused by the perils of the route (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-31.htm">Ezra 8:31</a>).

"King of kings, <span class="accented">kkshayathiya khshaya-thiyanam</span>," an equivalent of the modern <span class="accented">shahinshah</span>, was a recognised title of the Persian monarchs, and is found in every Persian inscription of any considerable length (Rawlinson, 'Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persis,' vol. 1 pp. 195, 271, 279, 287, 292, etc.). It was a title that had been used occasionally, though not at all frequently, by the Assyrian monarchs ('Records of the Past,' vol. 3. p. 41; vol. 5. p. 8), and naturally expressed the fact that those monarchs for the most part maintained the native princes on the thrones of the countries which they conquered (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-8.htm">Isaiah 10:8</a>). It was less appropriate to the Persians, whose empire was in the main satrapial, but still had a basis of truth to rest upon, since the Persian monarch had always a certain number of tributary kings under him ( cf. 'Herod.,' 5:104, 118; 8:142; Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:2, &sect;12; 'Hellen.,' 4:1,&sect;&sect; 3,4,etc.). The Parthian kings took the title from the time of Mithridates I.; and from them it passed to the Sassanians, who style themselves <span class="accented">malkan malka</span>, from first to last, upon their coins. <span class="cmt_word">The God</span> <span class="cmt_word">of heaven.</span> On this favourite Persian expression see comment on Ezra 1:2. <span class="cmt_word">Perfect peace.</span> There is nothing in the Chaldee original in any way corresponding to "peace;" and the participle passage being translated as in the margin of the A.

That Israelites of all the tribes actually went up to Jerusalem on the occasion seems indicated by the "twelve bullocks for <span class="accented">all</span> Israel," which those who returned with Ezra offered on their arrival to the "God of Israel" (see <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>).

They are commonly identified with the "seven princes of Persia and Media," mentioned in Esther (<a href="../../par/esther/1-14.htm">Esther 1:14</a>), "which saw the king's face," and "sate first in the kingdom." A conjecture, which, though not unreasonable, cannot be said to be substantiated, connects the "seven counsellors" with the seven great Persian septs, or families, which had privileges beyond the rest, and among them the right of unrestricted access to the royal presence ('Herod.,' 3:84). The commission which Ezra received is described in this verse as one <span class="cmt_word">to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem;</span> but the subject-matter of the inquiry is not mentioned. He can scarcely have been sent to make inquiry whether the law of Moses was observed or no, since that was certainly not a matter with which the Persian government would concern itself. Probably he was to inquire generally into the material prosperity of the province, and to report thereon.

The roads were never safe from robbers; and the more considerable the remittance, the greater the danger of its being intercepted.

The residue was, however, to be employed in any way that Ezra, acting under Divine guidance, might direct (see below, ver. 18). Apparently, this residue was actually employed on beautifying the temple (see ver. 27). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-18.htm">Ezra 7:18</a></div><div class="verse">And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.</div><div class="comm">

Rather, it would seem, they were a part of the voluntary "offering" mentioned in ver. 15, in which they are distinctly included (Ezra 8:25-28). We may perhaps conclude that the vessels sent with Zerubbabel had proved insufficient in number for the great festivals. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-20.htm">Ezra 7:20</a></div><div class="verse">And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow <i>it</i> out of the king's treasure house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whatever</span> <span class="cmt_word">more shall be needful.</span> Here the terms of the <span class="accented">firman</span> are very wide indeed, and authorise apparently an unlimited application of the royal revenue, or, at any rate, of the revenue of the province, to any purpose in any way connected with the temple. Probably it was expected that Ezra's own discretion would act as a restraint. If this failed, the royal treasurers would see that the amounts specified in ver. 22 were not exceeded. <span class="cmt_word">The king's</span> <span class="cmt_word">treasure-house</span> is not the royal treasury at Susa, to which the tribute went up from the various provinces, but the local treasury of Judaea or Syria, to which the Jews made their remittances, and on which Ezra was now authorised to draw.

The <span class="accented">cor</span> is variously estimated, at 44.25 gallons and at 86.67 gallons. It contained ten <span class="accented">baths.</span> Orders on the treasury for so much wheat, wine, oil, and salt sound strangely in modern ears; but were natural enough in the Persian system, where taxation was partly in kind, and every province had to remit to the court the choicest portion of its produce. Wine, corn, oil, and salt were all of them produced abundantly in Palestine, which was "a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of off olive, and of honey" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-32.htm">2 Kings 18:32</a>), and which, in the region about the Dead Sea, abounded with salt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/7-23.htm">Ezra 7:23</a></div><div class="verse">Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why</span> <span class="cmt_word">should there be wrath against the realm?</span> In the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanns there was "wrath against the realm" of Persia in a very dangerous quarter, viz., Egypt. Egypt had revolted from the Persians in  <span class="date">B.C. 460</span>, and in the following year, with the assistance of the Athenians, had driven the last Persian out of the country. A vain attempt was made by an embassy to Sparta, towards the close of  <span class="date">B.C. 459</span>, to force Athens to recall her troops. In  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>, Artaxerxes' seventh year, it was resolved that a Persian force should attempt the recovery of the revolted country. Artaxerxes gives his <span class="accented">firman</span> to Ezra when this expedition is preparing to start, and partly alludes to the past "wrath," shown in the success of the rebels, partly deprecates any further visitation. Without pretending to penetrate the Divine counsels, it may be noticed that from the year  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span> things went well for the Persians in Egypt. Memphis was recovered in that year or the next; and in  <span class="date">B.C. 455</span> the Athenians were finally defeated, and the province recovered. <span class="cmt_word">The king and his</span> <span class="cmt_word">sons.</span> This mention of the "sons" of Artaxerxes has been regarded as a proof that the Artaxerxes of Esther was Mnemon, and not Longimanus (Patrick). But it is quite a gratuitous supposition that Longimanus, who had attained to manhood before he ascended the throne, had no sons in the seventh year of his reign. Ultimately he left behind him eighteen sons (Ctesias, 'Exc. Pers.,' &sect; 44).

Hitherto the king has made every permission and command to rest on his own sole authority (see vers. 12, 13, 21). Now that he reaches the most important point in the whole of his decree - the permanent exemption of a large part of the people from liability to taxation of any kind, his style changes, and he says, "<span class="accented">We</span> certify you." Perhaps he speaks in the name of himself <span class="accented">and his successors</span>; or possibly he means to say that in this matter he has asked and obtained the assent and consent of his council (compare ver. 28). Or ministers. Rather, "and ministers." It is generally allowed that the word here translated "ministers" is not applied to the Nethinim, but to that still lower grade of attendants in the sanctuary called "Solomon's servants" in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-55.htm">Ezra 2:55-58</a>, and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-57.htm">Nehemiah 7:57-60</a>. <span class="cmt_word">It shall not be lawful</span> <span class="cmt_word">to impose toll, tribute, or custom upon them</span> It may be suspected from this proviso that the Persians exempted from taxation their own (Magian) priests, though of this there is no other evidence. But they would scarcely have placed a foreign priesthood on a higher level of favour than their own.

The one translated "magistrates" is that which gives its title to the Book of "Judges." <span class="cmt_word">Which may judge all the people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy</span> God. The latter clause is probably intended to be limitative of the former, and to consign to Ezra's government only the Jewish portion of the population, in which, however, are to be reckoned the proselytes (see comment on Ezra 6:21). <span class="cmt_word">And teach ye them that know them not.</span> As the other inhabitants of Syria were not Zoroastrians, but idolaters, Ezra was given free permission to spread his religion among them.

EZRA'S THANKSGIVING ON RECEIPT OF ARTAXERXES' LETTER (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-27.htm">Ezra 7:27, 28</a>). With an abruptness that may appear strange, but which has many parallels in the works of Oriental writers, Ezra passes without a word of explanation from Artaxerxes' letter to his own thanksgiving upon the receipt of it. Compare the interjectional prayers of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-4.htm">Nehemiah 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-19.htm">Nehemiah 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-9.htm">Nehemiah 6:9, 14</a>, etc.).

All thoughts favorable to the Jews are regarded by Ezra as impressed upon the hearts of heathen kings by the direct action of God. To beautify. Or "adorn." Ezra gathers from the general tenor of the king's letter that the adornment of the temple is his main object (see comment on ver. 17).

DETAILS OF EZRA'S JOURNEY FROM BABYLON TO JERUSALEM (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-15.htm">Ezra 8:15-31</a>). We gather from scattered statements in this passage - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Ezra, with his companions, after a journey of nine days' duration, reached Ahava from Babylon on the ninth day of the first month; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he rested three days at Ahava, and proclaimed a fast; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he was there joined by a small number of Levites and a considerable body of Nethinims from the immediate neighbourhood; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That, on the twelfth day of the first month, he resumed his journey, and, though threatened by some opposition upon the way, arrived safely at his destination fourteen weeks after he quitted Ahava, and exactly four months after he had started from Babylon. The only other important fact mentioned is, that at Ahava twelve of the principal priests were selected by Ezra, and the royal offering of silver, gold, and vessels handed over to them for safe custody, after having been carefully weighed. The weights are recorded with Ezra's usual exactness in vers. 26, 27.

The "river that runneth to Ahava" is now generally identified with the Is of Herodotus (1:179), a small stream flowing into the Euphrates from the east, at a point where stood a city of the same name, distant (according to Herodotus) <span class="accented">eight</span> days' journey from Babylon. The city appears to be mentioned under the slightly variant forms of Ava (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Ivah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) in the Second Book of Kings (2 Kings 17:24; 19:13). It is called Aia, or Aba, by the LXX.; Ihi in the Talmud; Aei by Isidore of Charax. The modern name is Hit. The town has always been one of some importance in connection with the bitumen springs of the neighbourhood. Ezra s reason for selecting the place as a halting-point seems to have been the fact that many Jews were settled in the district (see ver. 17). <span class="cmt_word">We abode in tents</span>. A large caravan, like Ezra's, even when it reached a town, would pitch its tents outside, and remain in them rather than scatter itself among the khans and caravanserais. The phrase is therefore to be understood literally. <span class="cmt_word">I viewed</span> <span class="cmt_word">the people.</span> Rather, "I looked among the people" - I looked to see whether there were any Levites or no.

It is difficult to account for the fact; but there seems certainly to have been a special disinclination to return to Jerusalem on the part of the Levites. Only seventy-four went up with Zerubbabel, when the priests who returned were 4289 (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36-40</a>); and now there was not a single one in the whole of Ezra's band.

Jezebel proclaimed one in Ahab's name when she wished to impress the Jezreelites with the notion that a great crime had been committed. Jehoshaphat did the same when he was invaded by the Ammonites, Moabites, and Mehunim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>). A fast was proclaimed in the fifth year of Jehoiakim when the kingdom of Judah was menaced by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a>). Ezra therefore assumes that he may command one now, in connection with the perils of the coming journey. <span class="cmt_word">That we might afflict ourselves.</span> The Jews were commanded to "afflict themselves" on the great day of atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29</a>), and understood that the affliction was to be mainly by fasting and abstaining from the bath. <span class="cmt_word">To ask of him a right</span> <span class="cmt_word">way.</span> Or "a direct road," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prosperous and unimpeded journey to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">For us</span> <span class="cmt_word">and our little ones.</span> The colonists went up attended by their families.

Before he apprehended danger Ezra had boasted to Artaxerxes of the power and goodness of God, and had spoken of himself and his brethren as assured of the Divine protection. Now that peril threatened he found himself afraid, and would have been glad of such an escort as Nehemiah obtained at a later date (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-9.htm">Nehemiah 2:9</a>). But after his boasts he was ashamed to confess his fear. Who the <span class="cmt_word">enemy in the way</span> was it is impossible to decide; but we may gather from ver. 31 that it was no imaginary foe.

The true sense is given by the LXX. - "Then I assigned twelve of the chief priests to Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "then I appointed twelve chief priests to act with twelve chief Levites, of whom Sherebiah and Hashabiah were two, in the matter of the royal offering." Ezra seems to have considered, that as the gift of Artaxerxes was an offering to the house of God, it ought to be handed over at once to the custody of the ministers of religion, and not remain in secular hands (compare ver. 28).

EZRA'S THREE DAYS' REST AT JERUSALEM, AND SUBSEQUENT EXECUTION OF THE MORE PRESSING OF THE COMMISSIONS INTRUSTED TO HIM (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32-36</a>). After the fatigues of a four months' journey, a brief period of complete rest was well-nigh necessary. Like Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11</a>), Ezra was content with a rest of three days. On the fourth he discharged himself of his commission to present to the temple treasury the offerings of the Persian king, his counsellors and lords (ver. 25), together with that spontaneously contributed by the Israelites who had accompanied him (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-16.htm">Ezra 7:16</a>). This he did by appearing in person before the priests and Levites who were in charge of the temple, and making over to them the entire offering of gold, silver, and vessels which had been brought to Jerusalem from Babylon. At the same time the exiles whom he had induced to return, and whom he had conducted in safety through so long a journey, sacrificed on the altar of burnt offerings a number of bullocks, rams, lambs, and he-goats, as a token of their thankfulness to God for delivering them from the perils of the way. After this Ezra proceeded to make known to the satraps and other governors of the provinces lying west of the Euphrates the terms of the permanent commission which he had received from the king. The result was that these officials thenceforth helped the Jews instead of hindering them, and furnished the necessary supplies for the temple service.

It was not till the seventeenth day of the ninth month that, on Ezra's motion, the matter of the mixed marriages was taken in hand (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-8.htm">Ezra 10:8, 9</a>).

They were "a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>); bound to be "separated from all the people that were on the face of the earth" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-16.htm">Exodus 33:16</a>), and to keep themselves a "peculiar people." When they <span class="cmt_word">mingled themselves with the people of the</span> lands, they not only broke a positive command (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3</a>), but did their best to frustrate God's entire purpose in respect of them, and to render all that he had done for them of no effect. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in the trespass.</span> "Princes and rulers" are here opposed to people of the middle and lower ranks. The upper classes, whether clerical or lay, had been the chief offenders (see <a href="../../par/ezra/10-18.htm">Ezra 10:18</a>); and compare the similar defection of Jews of the upper classes in Nehemiah's time (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4, 28</a>). EZRA'S ASTONISHMENT AND HORROR (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3, 4</a>). In Babylonia, whence Ezra had come, the inclination to intermarry with the heathen had not, it would seem, shown itself. Exiles in a foreign land naturally cling to each other under their adverse circumstances, and, moreover, being despised by those among whom they sojourn, are not readily accepted by them into social fellowship, much less into affinity and alliance. Thus the thing was to Ezra a new thing. His familiarity with the Law, and, perhaps we may add, his insight into the grounds upon which the Law upon this point was founded, caused him to view the matter as one of the gravest kind, and to feel shocked and horror-struck at what was told him respecting it. He showed his feelings with the usual openness and <span class="accented">abandon</span> of an Oriental: first rending both his outer and his inner garments, then tearing his hair and his beard, and finally" sitting down astonied," motionless and speechless, until the time of the evening sacrifice. Such a manifestation of horror and amazement was well calculated to impress and affect the sympathetic and ardent people over whom Providence had placed him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I rent my garment and my mantle.</span> Rending the clothes was always, and still is, one of the commonest Oriental modes of showing grief. Reuben rent his clothes when his brothers sold Joseph to the Midianites, and Jacob did the same when he believed that Joseph was dead (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>). Job "rent his mantle" on learning the death of his sons and daughters (<a href="../../par/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>); and his friends "<span class="accented">rent</span> every one his mantle when they came to mourn with him and comfort him" (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11, 12</a>). Rent clothes indicated that a messenger was a messenger of woe (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>), or that a man had heard something that had greatly shocked him, and of which he wished to express his horror (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-37.htm">2 Kings 18:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-65.htm">Matthew 26:65</a>). Ezra's action is of this last kind, expressive of horror more than of grief, but perhaps in some degree of grief also. <span class="cmt_word">And plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard.</span> These are somewhat unusual signs of grief among the Orientals, who were wont to shave the head in great mourning, but seldom tore the hair out by the roots. The practice is not elsewhere mentioned in Scripture, excepting in the apocryphal books (1 Esdras 8:71; 2 Esdras 1:8; Apoc. <a href="../../par/esther/4-2.htm">Esther 4:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And sat down astonied.</span> Compare <a href="../../par/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>, where the same verb is used in the same sense.

A crowd assembled around him, attracted by the unusual sight - partly sympathizing, partly no doubt curious. <span class="cmt_word">Every one came</span> <span class="cmt_word">that trembled at the words of the God of Israel;</span> by which is meant not so much all God-fearing persons (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-2.htm">Isaiah 66:2</a>) as all who were alarmed at the transgression of the commands of God (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-3.htm">Ezra 10:3</a>), and at the threats which the Law contained against transgressors (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the transgression of those that had been carried away.</span> The transgression of "the children of the captivity" (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1</a>) - of those who had been removed to Babylon and had returned under Zerubbabel. <span class="cmt_word">I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.</span> As morning is the time for business in the East, we may assume that the princes had waited upon Ezra tolerably early in the day - before noon, at any rate - to communicate their intelligence. The evening sacrifice took place at three in the afternoon. Ezra must, therefore, either from the intensity of his own feelings or with the view of impressing the people, have "sat astonied" - speechless and motionless - for several hours. EZRA'S CONFESSION AND PRAYER TO GOD (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5-15</a>). The most remarkable feature of Ezra's confession is the thoroughness with which he identifies himself with his erring countrymen, blushes for their transgressions, and is ashamed for their misconduct. All their sins he appears to consider as his sins, all their disobedience as his disobedience, all their perils as his perils. Another striking feature is his sense of the exceeding sinfulness of the particular sin of the time (see vers. 6, 7, 10). He views it as a "great trespass" - one that "is grown up into the heavens" - which is equivalent to a complete forsaking of God's commandments, and on account of Which he and his people "cannot stand before" God. This feeling seems based partly on the nature of the sin itself (ver. 14), but also, and in an especial way, on a strong sense of the ingratitude shown by the people in turning from God so soon after he had forgiven their former sins against him, and allowed them to return from the captivity, rebuild the temple, and re-establish themselves as a nation. If after their deliverance they again fell away, the sin could not but be unpardonable; and the punishment to be expected was a final uprooting and destruction from which there could be no recovery (vers. 13, 14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezra/9-5.htm">Ezra 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness.</span> The time of sacrifice was the fittest time for prayer, especially for a prayer in which acknowledgment of sin was to form a large part. Sacrifice symbolized expiation; and Ezra probably felt that his supplication would be helped by the expiatory rite which was being performed at the time. He <span class="cmt_word">rent his garment and his mantle</span> a second time, as a renewed indication of sorrow, and with the view of impressing the people who "were assembled unto him" (ver. 4) the more, and stirring them up to penitence.
