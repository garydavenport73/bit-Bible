There we saw David crowned with earthly glory, and made the monarch of a vast empire; he is also a prophet, and, as such, not only restores, but enriches and enlarges, the worship of the sanctuary; and, as prophet and king, he becomes not only the type, but the ancestor of the Messiah. In this narrative he is a sinner, punished with terrible, though merited, severity, and must henceforth walk humbly and sorrowfully as a penitent before God. From <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1</a> we learn that the king's name was Nahash; but whether he was the same as the Nahash mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a> is uncertain. There was an interval of more than forty years between, but Nahash was probably a young man, just seated on the throne, when he attacked Jabesh-Gilead; and Saul, who repelled him, might have been still alive but for the battle of Gilbea. The name means a "serpent," and is used in Job 26:18 of the constellation Draco. It may thus have been a name assumed by several Ammonite kings, the dragon representing majesty and power, and being the symbol on their seal, just as it is the Chinese imperial emblem now. The phrase, "It came to pass after this," has no chronological significance either here or in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. It is simply a form of transition from one subject to another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His father showed kindness unto me.</span> This makes it probable that it was the same Nahash as Saul's enemy. The smart of the defeat caused by Saul's energy would make him regard with friendship any one who was a thorn in the side of the man who had so unexpectedly stopped him in his career, and hence his kindness to David. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David <i>rather</i> sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father!</span> This insinuation arose probably from ill will, stirred up by David's success in war; and, with that distrust with which neighbouring nations too often regard one another, they see in his embassy only a purpose of spying into their defences with view to future attack. Rabbah, their city, was a place strong beth naturally and by reason of its fortifications. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, <i>even</i> to their buttocks, and sent them away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hanun...  shaved off the one half of their beards.</span> To an Oriental the beard was the mark of his being a free man, and to cut it off on one side was not merely an insult to David's ambassadors, but the treating them like slaves. Moreover, as only the priests wore underclothing, and as the ordinary dress of men consisted of a tunic and a loose flowing robe thrown over it, the cutting of this robe short up to the hip was a vile and abominable affront. Of course, Hanun intended this as a challenge to war, whereas David had meant peace and friendship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">When they told <i>it</i> unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</div><div class="comm">

As the Hebrew literally means, <span class="accented">had made themselves stink</span>, the Revised Version rightly translates "had made themselves odious." <span class="cmt_word">The children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians.</span> From <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a> we learn that his mercenaries from Aram cost Hanun a thousand talents of silver, or nearly five hundred thousand pounds - a vast sum, especially considering the great relative value of silver in those days. The mercenaries, moreover, were gathered out of numerous districts of Aram - from Rehob, Zoba, Beth-Maacah, and Tob; the margin being right in rendering "the men of Tob," instead of "Ish-tob." So, too, the Revised Version, "The men of Tob twelve thousand men." It was to this land that Jephthah fled (<a href="../../par/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>). The whole number of the allies was thirty-three thousand, with which total the parallel place agrees, as they are described there as "thirty-two thousand, and the King of Maacah and his people," who are here said to have been a thousand strong. The text, however, there must be corrupt, as it describes them all as horsemen (Authorized Version, "chariots;" <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>); here footmen only are mentioned, with which the narrative agrees (see note on ver. 18). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And when David heard of <i>it</i>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the host of the mighty men.</span> The Hebrew is, <span class="accented">and all the host, mighty men.</span> By this is meant, not "the mighties," but that the Israelites had now become practised in war, and veterans. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-8.htm">2 Samuel 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Syrians... were by themselves in the field.</span> We learn from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a> that the rendezvous of the Arameans was at Medeba, a small town situated upon a hill in the Mishor, or treeless prairie land, called "the plain" in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-16.htm">Joshua 13:16</a>. As it was four miles southeast of Heshbon, and more than twenty miles distant from Rabbah, it  is plain that they were marching northward, and that Joab was only just in time to prevent a junction of the two armies. The Ammonites, who were expecting their allies, and knew of their approach, had come outside of Rabbah, but had only posted themselves in fighting order "at the entering in of the gate." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice <i>men</i> of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The front of the battle.</span> The object of Joab was to prevent at all hazards the junction of the Syrians with the Ammonites, and he was only just in time to throw himself between them. This was resolute but dangerous policy, as, in case of defeat, he would have a powerful enemy in his rear. Apparently, however, he was aware that his real work lay with the Syrian mercenaries, who were dangerous enough by themselves, and would become more than a match for him if they were reinforced by the men of Rabbah. He therefore leaves Abishai with such troops as he could spare to watch the Ammonites, feeling sure that they would not hazard an attack unless they saw matters going ill with him; and, taking with him all his bravest men, "the choice man of Israel," he prepares with them to give battle to the Syrians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-10.htm">2 Samuel 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put <i>them</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</div><div class="comm">

Joab recognized the full danger of their situation; for should he meet with any check in his attack on this vast host of mercenaries, he was well aware that the Ammonites, watching the battle with eager interest, would, on the first news of victory, rush upon Abishai with exulting fury; and the men with him, being only ordinary troops, would be disheartened by Joab's failure, so that without extraordinary bravery on their leader's part, they would give way, and all would be lost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-12.htm">2 Samuel 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be of good courage, and let us play the men.</span> The Hebrew employs two conjugations of the same verb, literally, <span class="accented">be strong, and let us show ourselves strong.</span> And need there was for bravery; for the welfare, as he went on to show, of all Israel, and the honour of Israel's God, were in jeopardy. Finally he adds, <span class="cmt_word">The Lord do that which seemeth him good.</span> They are the words not so much of confidence as of determined resolution. Come good or ill, he and Abishai would do their utmost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab drew nigh, and the people that <i>were</i> with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-14.htm">2 Samuel 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So Joab returned.</span> It seems strange to us that Joab should have made no attempt to follow up his victory. But as the Ammonites were posted close to the gate of their city, they would withdraw into it without less as soon as they learned that their allies were defeated. There was thus the certainty of a long siege before Rabbah could be taken. We gather from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a> that it was late in the year when Joab won this victory, and it was part of the weakness of ancient warfare that a long campaign was beyond the power of either side. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hadarezer</span> (see note on 2 Samuel 8:3). Hadarezer probably had been well content to let his subjects receive the pay of the Ammonites, and extend his empire at their cost. But as paramount king in Aram, the defeat of the mercenaries obliged him to make the war a national affair, and undertake the management of it himself. He therefore summons troops from all the Aramean states on both sides of the Euphrates, and places his own general, Shobach, in command, and makes Helam the place of gathering. <span class="cmt_word">Helam</span>. No such place is known, and the word might mean "their army," in which case the translation would be, "and they came in full force." The Vulgate takes it in this way, but makes the verb the causative singular, and translates, "and he brought their army." On the other hand, the LXX., the Syriac, and the Chaldee make it a proper name here, as even the Vulgate necessarily does in ver. 17, where there can be no doubt. In the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16, 17</a>) it is omitted in the first place, and in the second we find in its stead, "upon them." Either, therefore, the chronicler did not know of such a place, or the text is corrupt. Ewald and others suppose that Helam may be identified with Alamata; but we learn from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> that the battle was fought near Hamath, and Alamata is on the Euphrates, too far away for David to have made his attack there. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a></div><div class="verse">And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David...  gathered all Israel together.</span> Some commentators see in this an indication of dissatisfaction with Joab. Really it was a matter of course that in so great a war the king should place himself at the head of his levies. For not only was he possessed of great military genius, but his personal presence would make the men of Israel, a race of sturdy free men, assemble in greater numbers, and would give them confidence. If David himself went there would be no shirking the war and finding excuses to stay at home, and in the camp there would be prompt alacrity and zeal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew <i>the men of</i> seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David slew,</span> etc. (see note on 2 Samuel 8:4). We have seen there that the word translated "chariots" means any vehicle or animal for riding. The numbers here are seven hundred chariots with their charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen; in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> we have seventeen hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen; finally, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-18.htm">1 Chronicles 19:18</a> we find seven thousand chariots and charioteers, and forty thousand footmen. It is impossible to  reconcile these conflicting numbers, but as David had no cavalry, the numbers in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> are the more probable, namely, seventeen hundred cavalry and chariots, and twenty thousand infantry. The Syriac Version gives us here very reasonable numbers, namely, "seven hundred chariots, four thousand cavalry, and much people." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a></div><div class="verse">And when all the kings <i>that were</i> servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.

The wars with Damascus and Edom, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-5.htm">2 Samuel 8:5, 13</a>, probably followed immediately upon Hadarezer's defeat, but are not referred to here, as the interest now centres in David's personal conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm"><title>2 Samuel 11 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/11.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/11.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/11-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/10.htm" title="2 Samuel 10">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 11 <a href="../2_samuel/12.htm" title="2 Samuel 12">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth <i>to battle</i>, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah.

It seems quite certain that the war with Hadarezer did not take place in the same year as the defeat of the Syrians at Medeba. For the gathering of his mercenaries by Nahash would occupy a long time, and it was done so leisurely, that not only did news of it reach Jerusalem, but David was able to collect his forces, and instead of awaiting the invasion, could deliver his attack on the enemy's ground. The battle at Medeba took place in the autumn, and, as it was impossible to keep the field with winter so near, Joab marched back to Jerusalem, intending in the spring to return to the siege of Rabbah. But David quickly had information that a more serious war was impending, and, instead of sending Joab, he now gathers "all Israel," and, after gaining a victory, it is plain that he marched into the Syrian territories, and compelled by his presence the allies of Hadarezer to transfer their allegiance to him. Simultaneously with this war he had to meet the attack of the Edomites, for which purpose he detached Abishai with a portion of his army; and it was necessary also to post garrisons in their country, and in Atom of Damascus. It was while he was thus occupied in the Aramean states that he gathered the "much brass" spoken of in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>. The Ammonites would necessarily be left to themselves while these great events were going on, but now, after a respite of a year and a half, David <span class="cmt_word">sent Joab, and his servants,</span> that is, his officers - the word "servant" in Oriental courts being constantly used to designate those, high in rank near the king's person - <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel;</span> that is, an army gathered from all the tribes. In accordance with the cruel customs of ancient warfare, they began by laying the whole country waste, and putting all whom they found to the sword, and thus <span class="cmt_word">destroyed the children of Ammon</span> before laying siege to the capital, into which all the people by these harsh measures had been forced to go for refuge. In the Hebrew there is a curious spelling, the word "kings" being written <span class="accented">melakim</span>, with an <span class="accented">aleph</span> to represent the long a. It is a mistake to suppose that a different word, <span class="accented">malakim</span>, "angels" or "ambassadors," is meant, as it is nothing more than an archaic method of spelling, instances of which have been made rare by the extreme fastidiousness of Hebrew scribes. There is, however, another example not far off, where the Hebrew word for "poor" is also written with an inserted <span class="accented">aleph.</span>

We are told that it is regarded in the East as improper for one neighbour to look over the battlement of his house into the inner court of the next dwelling (Philippson). Considering the jealousy with which Orientals guard the female members of their family from intrusion, it was a wrong act on the king's part to spy into what was going on in the recesses of the adjoining house. But he did so, and suffered for it years of disgrace and misery. For he saw a beautiful woman, the wife of one of his high officers, bathing, probably to purify herself from some legal uncleanness, such as those mentioned in <a href="../../par/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>. No blame, so far, must be attached to her. The place was regarded as perfectly secluded, and probably neither she nor Uriah had ever suspected that what went on there could be observed from the roof of the king's palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">And David sent and inquired after the woman.

Mr. Blunt, in his 'Undesigned Coincidences,' p. 143, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>, sees in this the explanation of the adherence to the side of Absalom of a man so high in King David's service. It was the result of his indignation at David's profligate treat-meat of so near a relative. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a> she is called "Bathshua, the daughter of Ammiel." The latter is a transposition of Eliam, both names being compounded of Am, people, and <span class="accented">El</span>, God. <span class="cmt_word">Uriah the Hittite.</span> We read in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a> that he was one of David's "mighties," and it is remarkable that we should thus find high in rank in David's army a member of that grand race who had disputed with Egypt and Assyria the empire of the East. Their head now was Toi, King of Hamath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David sent messengers, and took</span>  <span class="cmt_word">her</span>. David's fall seems as sudden as it was complete; but we may feel sure that there had been gradual preparation for it during the previous period of great prosperity. David had always been a man of strong passions, and the large harem he had set up at Jerusalem, so far from satisfying him, only intensified his lust. And now he who had previously shown himself so chivalrous and noble stoops to robbing one of his own officers of his honour. And stern and terrible was the punishment. When he sent those messengers, who were some of the vile people who hang about great personages, ready to minister to their sins, he was preparing the way for his daughter's disgrace, for the murder of Amnon, for Absalom's rebellion and death, and for the death of Adonijah. From that day his own house was the scene of horrible crimes, feuds, scandals, and miseries of every kind; and the long interval after his repentance, between the birth of Solomon and David's death, is passed over in gloomy silence. No act of the penitent king after his restoration to the throne is deemed worthy of record. He was pardoned, but his place henceforward was not in the light of God's favour, but in shadow and retirement. Men who fall so grievously must be content to be removed into the outer court. Of Bathsheba it must be said that she remained a faithful wife, and bare David four sons besides the one who was the fruit of their adultery, and that she retained her influence over him to the last (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For she was purified from her uncleanness;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and she purified herself from her uncleanness</span>; that is, having committed an act of gross immorality, she nevertheless carefully observed the ceremonial enactment commanded in <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-18.htm">Leviticus 15:18</a>. She went home unrepentant, and with her conscience defiled, but was all the more scrupulous in performing the rite that purified her outwardly.

Already was the punishment beginning to be required from both the guilty sharers in the wickedness.

Uriah, as one of David's thirty-seven heroes, would hold a high rank in the army, though the statement given by Josephus, that he was Joab's armour bearer, is probably a mere conjecture, made with the view of explaining what seemed to him strange, that a foreigner should hold so distinguished a place among the captains of Israel. David sends for him, on the pretext that he wanted full information of Joab's plans, and the state of the army, and the progress of the siege of Rabbah. And so prompt is Uriah, that he goes to the king still soiled with travel, and without calling at his house. And David makes his inquiries, listens with apparent interest to the narrative of the war, and, after receiving a full report, bids Uriah go home and rest and refresh himself after the journey. He sends him, moreover, a present, such probably as was usual after special service, but large and liberal, so as to put Uriah in good humour. But the old soldier cared for war more than for pleasure, and, instead of going to his house, spent the night in the guard room with the soldiers and others who were in attendance upon the king (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27, 28</a>). All would be eager for news of friends and relatives, and it was a far greater delight to Uriah to chat with his old comrades than to be resting luxuriously in his own home.

The Jews themselves feel the difficulty, and some of their rabbins affirm that this was not the ark of the covenant, but a chest containing the ephod whereby inquiries were made of Jehovah. Certainly in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a> it is expressly called "the ark of the covenant;" and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> "the ark of God." The use in our version of the special word "ark" obliges us to think of the ark of the covenant, whereas really it is a general word, rendered "chest" in <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9, 10</a>. It is said, too, that the war with Ammon was not a holy war, nor was it of such importance as to call for David's presence at the head of his troops. But, on the other hand, if it was not the ark of God, why did Uriah lay so great stress upon its presence in the field? Moreover, we find the ark with Saul in his war with the Philistines (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-18.htm">1 Samuel 14:18</a>), where it is expressly called "the ark of God," and is used for the purpose of inquiring the will of Jehovah. On comparing <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a> with <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>, we should have imagined that the ark abode uncared for at the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, did we not plainly find it in attendance upon Saul. We  are thus compelled to conclude that David sent it, with its attendant priests, with Joab, that he might consult the Deity by its moans. In the Talmud ('Shek. Jerus.,' 9. 2) the idea of there being an inferior or second ark used for this purpose is condemned. David, in his remonstrance with Uriah, shows signs of displeasure, and the conduct of the latter suggests the idea that his suspicious had been aroused. The war was going on prosperously; he had been summoned home on an honourable pretext to give the king a report of it; and it is, to say the least, strange that he should have cared so little for a wife, to whom apparently he had not long been married, and for his domestic affairs, as not even to go to his house, which was close by. The tone, too, of Uriah's answer is excited, and his military ardour too warm. David had assumed that, as a matter of course, he would hasten to visit his wife, and Uriah's unexpected refusal upsets his devices, and leaves him with all his difficulties increased rather than done away with. Very probably, in the conversation in the guard room, Uriah had received hints that his wife was too high in the royal favour. For "tents" the Hebrew has "booths," and so the Revised Version; and for "fields" the singular, "field." The Israelites still lived mostly in tents, and in war were content with very slight and temporary shelter, and if there were any parks, or enclosures, they were called Naioth, while "the field" was the open unenclosed land, which formed the mass of the country. The separate mention of "Israel and Judah" is no indication of the book having been written after the disruption of the kingdom. Uriah had been in David's service when he was king only at Hebron, and had taken part in the long war between Judah and the house of Saul.

But even when intoxicated Uriah kept to his determination; and though on this second night there would not be the same pleasure in chatting with old comrades seen again after long absence, he still sleeps in the guard room. And thus there were witnesses that he had not gone to his house. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent <i>it</i> by the hand of Uriah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David wrote a letter.</span> David now uses the knowledge he had acquired in the schools of the prophets for vicious purposes. For it to be a blessing, knowledge must be sanctified to holy use. The letter would conceal from Joab the truth, and only let him know that Uriah, during his visit to Jerusalem, had incurred the king's serious displeasure; and we may be quite sure that Joab would be very indignant when he learned, as he certainly soon would, that David had made him his tool, and caused him to murder one of "the mighties" in order to cover the shame of his adultery. The only fair side of the picture is that it shews the high state of morality among the people. The crimes of kings and great men are usually lightly pardoned, and especially that of adultery. Even in our own and other Christian countries this is the case; but David has to resort to extreme measures rather than face the indignation of his subjects. Unfortunately, the shedding of blood was not looked upon with equal horror. Possibly the leaving it to the relatives to requite it made the suppression of murder the business, not of the state, but of "the avenger of blood." At all events, Joab without much compunction carries out David's orders, caring to know no more than that Uriah was out of favour. And what is more extraordinary, David remains utterly callous for a whole twelvemonth (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-15.htm">2 Samuel 12:15</a>), and his conscience does not even smite him for the additional meanness of sending the order for Uriah's murder by the hand of the injured man himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-15.htm">2 Samuel 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die.</div><div class="comm">

The verb simply refers to the ordinary operations of a siege, which usually resolved itself into a long blockade, continued until starvation compelled a surrender; and to hasten this the people of the villages were forced into the town, by the rule that all left outside were put to the sword. To maintain the blockade, men were posted at all fit points round the city, and these were constantly assailed by the besieged. Joab then placed Uriah at a post which was especially the object of attack; and when the usual sally took place and was repulsed, Joab seems to have ordered Uriah to pursue them up to the very gate, where they would be exposed to a shower of arrows from the walls. Others fell besides Uriah, and that the loss was considerable, and the result of bad generalship, though designedly such, seems probable from the deprecation of the king's anger in ver. 20. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-17.htm">2 Samuel 11:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell <i>some</i> of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</div><div class="comm">

With well-feigned hypocrisy, he makes the messenger believe that David will be displeased at the loss of life, and will blame him for his want of caution. But it is curious that the messenger is instructed  to mention the death of Uriah only after the king has given utterance to his anger. Possibly the meaning of this is that the loss of one so high in rank, and the king's near neighbour, is so serious a matter that it must be gradually broken to him, lest his indignation at Joab should be too violent. Probably there was also the suggestion that Uriah had been himself too rash, and had incurred his fate by his own fault. The reference to the fate of Abimelech (<a href="../../par/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>) proves that the history of the times of the judges was generally known. Very probably not only records of the several events existed, but the Book of Judges was already written In Samuel's schools the youth of Israel were instructed in the annals of their country, and men like Nathan and Gad, and ethers who aided Samuel in his work, would be sure quickly to turn their attention to the orderly arrangement and digest of the records in their possession.

(On the substitution of Besheth, or more correctly Bosheth, for Baal, see notes on 2 Samuel 2:8; 9:6.) It is remarkable that the LXX., Vulgate, and Syriac all read here Jerubbaal, though, like the Hebrew, they have Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth. Probably the change, which was not made until after the days of Jezebel, was only gradually carried out by the scribes.

As for Uriah's death, of course it is to be regretted, but such is the fortune of war, and the sword devours now one and now another. The last words, <span class="cmt_word">encourage thou him,</span> have provoked comment, as though the messenger was to aid and abet Joab.

Having been the cause of his murder, she is careful to make for him the customary mourning. How long it lasted is uncertain. The mourning for Aaron (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and that for Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>) were each for thirty days; while that for Jacob at Atad (<a href="../../par/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>) and that of the men of Jabesh-Gilead for Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>) lasted only for seven days. Both these, however, were under such exceptional circumstances as made them no rule; but in Ecclus. 22:12 we read, "Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead," and the national lamentation for Judith lasted the same time (Judith 16:24). Probably, however, the mourning of a widow for her husband would last a month. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-27.htm">2 Samuel 11:27</a></div><div class="verse">And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son.

Too commonly men who have conquered kingdoms have been vanquished by their own strong passions; and David had always evinced a keen appetite for sensuous pleasures. Even at Hebron he had multiplied unto himself wives, and now, raised by repeated victory to be the lord of a vast empire, he ceased to be "base in his own sight" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-22.htm">2 Samuel 6:22</a>), and lost his self control. And, as was to be expected in a man of such strong qualities, his fall was terrible. But this declaration of the inspired narrator is not made solely for ethical reasons, but is the key to all that follows up to the end of ch. 20. In this chapter we have had the history of David's sin; a year's respite succeeds, as if God would wait and see whether the sinner's own conscience would waken up, and bring him to repentance; but it slumbers on. Then comes the message of reproof, fellowed by earnest penitence, and severe punishment. It was, perhaps, during this year of hardened persistence in crime that Amnon and his cousin Jonadab also gave the reins to their passions, and prepared the way for the first of the series of crimes that polluted David's home. An early repentance might have saved the son; but the absence of paternal discipline, the loss of respect for his father, and the evil influence of that father's bad example, all urged on the son to the commission of his abominable crime.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm"><title>2 Samuel 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/11.htm" title="2 Samuel 11">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 12 <a href="../2_samuel/13.htm" title="2 Samuel 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD sent Nathan unto David.

The description, therefore, is not overcharged, for in many an English home the dog or cat takes its place as one of the family. The Revised Version preserves the tenderness of the original in translating "it did eat of his own morsel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-4.htm">2 Samuel 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A traveller,... wayfaring man,...  man that was come to him.</span> Nathan probably used these three terms chiefly to diversify his language, but it has served as a handle for much allegorizing. Thus Rashi explains it of covetousness, which comes at first as a mere "passer by," the literal meaning of the word rendered "traveller." But, if admitted, it grows into "a wayfaring man," who comes and goes on business, and stays a longer time. Finally it changes into "one who has come to him," and remains permanently. Such allegorical interpretations are common in the Fathers, and thus Augustine compares the three stages of sin to our Lord's three miracles of raising the dead. The sinner is at first like Jairus's daughter, just dead, and repentance can restore him immediately to life; but, if sin be persisted in, he becomes like the son of the widow of Nain, carried away  to burial; and finally like Lazarus, given over to corruption. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this <i>thing</i> shall surely die:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall surely die.</span> It is strange language to declare that a man shall be put to death and then fined four lambs; But David says nothing of the sort, but that the man is "a son of death," that is, a wretch who deserves to die. The Revised Version correctly renders, "is worthy to die." The sentence actually passed, of fourfold restitution, is exactly in accordance with the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>), but the moral turpitude of the offence was far greater than could be atoned for by the legal penalty. Rightly, therefore, David expressed his indignation, and regretted that the sentence was so light; but a judge must not strain the law, which necessarily has regard chiefly to the outward offence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Nathan said to David, Thou <i>art</i> the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art the man!</span> Abruptly and with sudden vehemence comes the application to David himself. So skilfully had the parable been contrived, that up to this point David had had no suspicion that he was the rich man who had acted so meanly by his poorer neighbour Uriah. And now he stood self-condemned. Yet even so self-love might have made his indignation break forth against Nathan; but probably the reproof only completed a work that had long been secretly in progress, and brushed away the last obstacles to repentance. I anointed thee. The solemn anointing made David the representative of Jehovah, and thus his sin was aggravated by the degradation in the eyes of the people, beth of the kingly office and also of Jehovah himself. Rank and authority are given to men that they may lead others to do right; it is a fearful misuse of them when they give prestige to sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if <i>that had been</i> too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave...  thy master's wives into thy bosom.</span> These words probably mean that, as the whole possessions of his predecessor belonged, by Oriental custom, to the next occupant of the throne, David might have claimed the entire household and the wives both of Saul and Ishbosbeth as his own, though apparently he had not done so. As far as we know, Saul had but one wife (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>) and one concubine, Rizpah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>). Of Ishbosheth's family arrangements we know little, but his harem, if he had one, would become the property of David. But independently of this, the permission of polygamy had made it possible for him to take any of the daughters of Israel and Judah to wife, and he had freely availed himself of this licence. Yet, not content, he had lusted after a married woman, and had got rid of her husband by murder, meanly using the sword of the Ammonites to accomplish his own criminal purpose. The word used in this clause, and rendered "thou hast slain him," is a very strong one, and literally means "thou hast murdered him," though the sword was that of the enemy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife <i>to be</i> thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword shall never depart from thine house;</span> that is, thy crime shall not be expiated by one slaughter, but by many, so that thy punishment shall cease only at thine own death. This sentence was fulfilled in Amnon's murder (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>), who had been encouraged in his crime by his father's example. Upon this followed Absalom's rebellion and death (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>); and finally, when in his last hours David made Solomon his successor, he knew that he was virtually passing sentence on Adonijah, the eldest of his surviving sons. But what a fearful choice! for had he not done so, then Bathsheba and her four sons would doubtless have been slain, whereas there was some hope that Solomon might spare his brother. That Adonijah was unworthy we gather from the fact that he had ceased to be cohen, and that this office was conferred, after Absalom's rebellion, on Ira the Jairite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-26.htm">2 Samuel 20:26</a>), Solomon being then too young to hold such a position. Until he committed this crime, David's family had probably dwelt in concord, and it was his own wickedness which broke up their unity, and introduced among them strife, mutual hatred, and the shedding of blood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give <i>them</i> unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall lie with thy wives.</span> Fulfilled for political purposes by Absalom, under the advice of Bathsheba's grandfather (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>). The punishment was thus complete. For the murdered Uriah there was fourfold restitution, according to David's own sentence. First there was Bathsheba's child lately born, then Amnon, thirdly Absalom, and lastly Adonijah. For the adultery there was open disgrace wrought upon his royal dignity "before the sun," in open daylight. As he had brought shame and dishonour upon the family relations of his neighbour, so were his own family rights violated by his rebellious son. And, as is often the case, the sins which followed were worse than those which prepared the way. Vice begins as a small stream trickling through the opposing dam. but it quickly breaks down all moral restraints, and rushes along like a destroying flood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-12.htm">2 Samuel 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">For thou didst <i>it</i> secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a></div><div class="verse">And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned against Jehovah.</span> Saul had used the same words, and had meant very little by them; nor had he added "against Jehovah," because his purpose was to appease Samuel, and prevail upon him not to disgrace him before the people. David's confession came from the heart. There is no excuse making, no attempt at lessening his fault, no desire to evade punishment. <a href="../../par/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a> is the lasting testimony, not only to the reality, but to the tenderness  of his repentance, and we may even feel here that confession was to him a relief. The deep internal wound was at length disclosed, and healing had become possible. Up to this time he had shut God away from his heart, and so there had been no remedy for a soul diseased. It was because his sorrow was genuine that comfort was not delayed. <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah also hath put away thy sin;</span> thou shalt not die. Now, death was the legal penalty for adultery (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>), and though it might not be easy to exact it of a king, yet, until it was remitted, David would be in the eyes of all "a son of death" (see on ver. 5); and how could he administer justice to others while the death sentence for a capital crime was hanging over himself? Had not the prophet been authorized to use his dispensing power as the mouthpiece of Jehovah, David could not have remained king. And we can see no reason for supposing, with Ewald and others, that a substantial interval of time elapsed between David's confession and Nathan's absolution. The sole conceivable reason for such a view would be the supposition that David's repentance began and was completed with the one stab of shame which pierced through him when he heard Nathan's sudden reproach. Such a mere thrill, following upon such persistent callousness, would have merited little attention. But if months of brooding sorrow and secret shame had been humbling David, then his open confession was the proof that the Spirit's work had reached the goal, and was now complete. And we gather from <a href="../../par/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3</a> that such was the case. "My sin," he says, "is ever before me." It had long haunted him; had long occupied his thoughts by day, and broken his rest at night. Like a flood, his iniquities had gone over his head, and threatened to drown him; like a heavy burden, they had pressed upon him so as to break him down (<a href="../../par/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>). Both these psalms tell of long continued sorrow of heart; but with confession had come relief. He had offered to God the sacrifice of a broken spirit, and knew that it had not been despised. We shall see subsequently that his time and attention had been much occupied with the Ammonite war, and this had probably helped him in evading the secret pleadings of his own conscience. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also <i>that is</i> born unto thee shall surely die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">thou hast made the enemies of Jehovah to despise</span>; that is, to despise Jehovah's government, the theocracy, of which David was the visible head and earthly representative. Jehovah's enemies are not the heathen, but Israelitish unbelievers, who would scoff at all religion when one in David's position fell into terrible open sin. But the death of the adulterous offspring of David and Bathsheba would prove to these irreligious men that Jehovah's righteous rule could reach and punish the king himself, and would thus vindicate his justice from their reproach. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-15.htm">2 Samuel 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a></div><div class="verse">David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... went in.</span> He went, not into the sanctuary, which he did not enter until after the child's death, but into some private room in his own house. There he remained, passing his nights stretched on the ground, and fasting until the seventh day. His fasting does not imply that he took no food during this long interval, but that he abstained from the royal table, and ate so much only as was necessary to maintain life. Now, what was the meaning of this privacy and abstinence? Evidently it was David's acknowledgment, before all his subjects, of his iniquity, and of his sorrow for it. The sickness of the child followed immediately upon Nathan's visit, and we may feel sure that news of his rebuke, and of all that passed between him and the king, ran quickly throughout Jerusalem. And David at once takes the position of a condemned criminal, and humbles himself with that thoroughness which forms so noble a part of his character. Grieved as he was at the child's sickness, and at the mother's sorrow, yet his grief was mainly for his sin; and he was willing that all should know how intense was his shame and self-reproach. And even when the most honourable of the rulers of his household (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>), or, as Ewald thinks, his uncles and elder brethren, came to comfort him, he persists in maintaining an attitude of heart stricken penitence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the elders of his house arose, <i>and went</i> to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.</div><div class="comm">

There was much personal regard for the child, which had been made the more precious by these very eyelets. But David's sorrow was, as we have seen, that of penitence, and not that of natural affection. When, therefore, the threatened penalty had been paid by the death of the child, David felt it to be his duty to show his resignation, and therefore he went into the sanctuary and worshipped, in proof that he acknowledged the justice of God's dealings, and was content to bear the punishment as his righteous desert. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-21.htm">2 Samuel 12:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then said his servants unto him, What thing <i>is</i> this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, <i>while it was</i> alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</div><div class="comm">

Hence some have supposed that, as Solomon is placed last of Bathsheba's four sons in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, three other sons had already been borne by her, and that consequently this child, the fruit of their adultery, would now have been seven or eight years of age. It is certainly remarkable that in ver. 16 David calls him "the lad" (so the Hebrew), though in every other place he is styled "the child." On the other hand, we gather from ver. 14 that probably he was as yet the only child, and this is the more reasonable view, even if Solomon was the youngest son (but see note on ver. 24). But secondly, the words indicate a belief in the continued existence of the child, and even that David would recognize and know him in the future world. Less than this would have given no comfort to the father for his loss. Now, it is true that we can find no clear dogmatic teaching in the early Scriptures upon the immortality of the soul. Job could give expression to no such hope in Job 7:6-10, and the belief in a world to come would have solved the difficulties of himself and his friends, which really are left unsolved. Even in the Psalms there are words that border on despair (see <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/88-11.htm">Psalm 88:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>); nor had Hezekiah any such belief in continued existence as could solace him in the expectation of an early death (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>). This hopelessness was not unnatural at a time when the doctrine had not been as yet clearly taught. On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/psalms/17-15.htm">Psalm 17:15</a> and Psalm 16:9-11 We find proof that David did believe in his own immortality. For though the latter words have a second and higher meaning, yet the primary sense of <a href="../../par/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> is that David's own soul (or self) would not always remain in Sheol, the abode of the departed, nor would he, Jehovah's anointed one, see such corruption as would end in annihilation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a></div><div class="verse">And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He called his name Solomon.</span> It is rashly assumed that Solomon's birth followed next in order after that of the deceased child. More probably there was a long interval of time, and son after son was born, with little increase of happiness to the family polluted by Amnon's sin and troubled by its miserable consequences. While we must not lay too great stress upon Solomon calling himself "a little child" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) after his accession, yet it forbids our believing that he was more than just grown up, It was the remarkable ability of Solomon, his goodness and precocious talent, which made him so great a comfort to his parents, and which received Jehovah's seal of approval in the name <span class="accented">Jedidiah.</span> This name would scarcely be given him until his good and great qualities were developing; and as it was a sort of indication that he was the chosen and elect son of David, and therefore the next king, we shall probably be right in believing that this second mission of Nathan, and this mark of Divine favour to David's youngest child, did not take place until after Absalom's death, possibly not until Solomon was ten or twelve years of age. The name <span class="accented">Solomon</span> means "the peaceful," and answers to the German <span class="accented">Friedrich.</span> It was given to the child in recognition that David's wars were now over, and that the era of quiet had begun, which was to be consecrated to the building of Jehovah's temple. It was the name given to the infant at his birth, and was a name of hope. Alas! this peace was to be rudely broken by the rebellion of the son whom David, in vain expectation and with all a father's pride, had named <span class="accented">Absalom</span>, "his father's peace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sent.</span> Some commentators make David the subject of the sentence, and translate, "And he, David, sent in the hand of Nathan, and called," etc. They suppose that this means that Nathan was entrusted with Solomon's education; but "in the hand" is the ordinary Hebrew preposition, meaning "by," and the sense plainly is that God sent a message by Nathan. David had already called the child Solomon, and now Jehovah, some years afterwards, gives him an indication of his special favour by naming him Yedidyah. The word is formed from the same root as <span class="accented">David</span>, that is, "lovely," with the addition of the Divine name. As we have already pointed out, this was no slight matter, but the virtual selection of Solomon to be David's successor, and probably, therefore, was delayed until he had given indica of his great intellectual gifts. His elder brothers would not be passed over without valid reasons. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab...  took the royal city.</span> As the siege of Rabbah would be conducted by the slow process of blockade, it might easily be prolonged into the second year, and so give ample space for David's sin and its punishment by the death of the child. But more probably the narrator, having commenced the history of David's sin, completes the story before returning to his account of the war. Thus the capture of Rabbah would occupy some of the interval between David's adultery and Nathan's visit of rebuke, and would lessen the difficulty, which we cannot help feeling, of David remaining for nine or ten months with the guilt of adultery and murder resting upon him, and no open act of repentance. Some short time, then, after Uriah's death, Joab captured "the city of waters." This is not a poetical name for Rabbah, but means  the "water city," that is, the town upon the Jabbok, whence the supply of water was obtained. The citadel, which occupied a high rock on the northwestern side, must, therefore, soon be starved into submission, and the whole of "the royal city," that is, of the metropolis of the Ammonites, be in Joab's power. He therefore urges David to come in person, both that the honour of the conquest may be his, and also because probably the blockading force had been reduced to as small a body of men as was safe, and the presence of a large army was necessary for completing the subjugation of the country, which would follow upon the capture of the capital.

And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Malcam.</span> This is another mode of spelling Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, and is found also in <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. Strictly, Milcom or Malcom is a proper name for the supreme deity, formed from the word <span class="accented">melec</span>, a king, or, as it was pronounced in other Semitic dialects, Moloch. Grammatically, <span class="accented">Malcam</span> also means "their king," and even so belongs to Milcom. For the crown weighed a hundred pounds, a ponderous mass, which no man could possibly bear, and, least of all, when making, as was the case with the Ammonite king, his last stand for his life. But after the capture of the city, it was lifted from the head of the idol, and placed formally upon David's head, and held there for a few moments, as a sign of victory and of rejoicing over the fall of the false god. There is no reason for supposing that there is any exaggeration in the weight, nor will the Hebrew allow us to understand the talent of gold as referring to its value. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">And he brought forth the people that <i>were</i> therein, and put <i>them</i> under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people that were therein.</span> The cruel treatment described in this verse was inflicted, first of all, upon those who had defended Rabbah, now reduced to a small number by the long siege; but David next proceeded through all the cities, that is, the fortified towns of the Ammonites, inflicting similar barbarities. They were confined probably to the fighting men, and most of these would make their escape as soon as resistance became hopeless. The general population would, of course, scatter themselves in every direction, but the misery caused by such a breaking up of civil life, as well as by the cruel bloodshed, must have been terrible. Instead of "he put them in a saw," we find, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, "he sawed them with a saw." This reading differs from what we have here only in one letter, and is plainly right, as the translation, "under saws," "under harrows of iron," etc., found both in the Authorized and Revised Versions, is simply an expedient, tendered necessary by the corruption of the text. If we restore the passage by the help of the parallel place, it runs on thus: "He sawed with a saw, and with threshing sledges of iron, and with cutting instruments of iron." What exactly the second were we do not know, as the word does not occur elsewhere. The Vulgate renders it "wains shod with iron," meaning, apparently, those driven over the corn for threshing purposes, and now driven over these unfortunate people. The barbarity is not more horrible than that of sawing prisoners asunder. <span class="cmt_word">He made them pass through the brick kiln.</span> Both the Septuagint and Vulgate have "brick kiln," Hebrew, <span class="accented">malban</span>, which the Massorites have adopted, but the Hebrew text has <span class="accented">malchan.</span> No commentator has given any satisfactory explanation of what can be meant by making the Ammonites pass through a brick kiln; but Kimchi gives a very probable interpretation of the word really found in the Hebrew, and which, not being intelligible, has been corrupted. For the Malchan was, he says, the place where the Ammonites made their children pass through the fire to Moloch. He thinks, therefore, that David put some of the people to death in this way. We cannot defend these cruelties, but they unhappily were the rule in Oriental warfare, and would have been inflicted on their enemies by the Ammonites. We have proof in l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a> and <a href="../../par/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a> that they were a barbarous race; but this did not justify barbarous retaliation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm"><title>2 Samuel 13 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/13.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/13.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/13-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/12.htm" title="2 Samuel 12">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 13 <a href="../2_samuel/14.htm" title="2 Samuel 14">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this.</span> This phrase, as we have seen on 2 Samuel 10:1, has little chronological force, but the date of the sad event which formed the second stage in David's punishment can be settled with considerable certainty. Tamar was the daughter of Maacah, a princess of Geshur, and David's marriage with her, while still at Hebron, is mentioned as a proof of his growing power, and consequently some time must have elapsed after his appointment as king before this alliance took place. As Absalom was apparently older than Tamar, if she were now fifteen or sixteen years of age. David would have been king of all Israel at least thirteen or fourteen years, and would have reached the summit of his glory. His wars would be over, Rabbah captured, and his empire firmly established. For twenty more years he must sit upon his throne, but as a culprit, and bear the many sorrows resulting from his sin. Amnon was David's firstborn, the son of Ahinoam of Jezreel; and probably he would never have committed his shameless crime had not David's own sin loosed the bonds of parental authority. As it was, he hesitated, but was encouraged to it by his cousin, who was too subtle a man not to weigh David's character well before coming to the conclusion that Amnon might safely gratify his lusts. The name Tamar means "palm tree," and both she and Absalom were remarkable for their personal beauty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-2.htm">2 Samuel 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she <i>was</i> a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick.</span> The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">and it was narrow to Amnon, even to becoming sick.</span> To an Oriental a feeling of narrowness means distress, while in joy there is a sense of largeness and expansion. Our words for distress have lost this picturesque force. That Amnon <span class="cmt_word">thought it hard</span> does not mean that he had any feeling for his sister's disgrace, but that he knew that his attempt was difficult. He did not see how he could get Tamar into his power, and feared the consequences. The wives had each her own dwelling, and the daughters were kept in strict seclusion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">But Amnon had a friend, whose name <i>was</i> Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab <i>was</i> a very subtil man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonadab, the son of Shimeah.</span> He is called Shammah in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-9.htm">1 Samuel 16:9</a>, and is there described as Jesse's third son.

There was probably a gathering  of friends every morning at the young prince's house, and his cousin, attending this levee, noticed Amnon's melancholy, and, having forced a confession from him, is unscrupulous enough to suggest a plan that would make Tamar her brother's victim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-5.htm">2 Samuel 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see <i>it</i>, and eat <i>it</i> at her hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thy father cometh to see thee.</span> While the daughters lived in Oriental seclusion in the dwellings of their mothers, the sons seem to have had separate apartments assigned them in the palace. And David evidently was an affectionate father, who even went to the abodes of his sons in a loving and unceremonious way, to see how they fared. But Jonadab abused the king's affection, and made it the very means of removing the obstacles in the way of his daughter's disgrace. And like the whole tribe of flatterers and time servers, he employed his cleverness to gratify his patron's momentary passion, indifferent to the miserable consequences which must inevitably follow. For the least punishment which Amnon would have to bear would be exclusion from the succession to the crown, besides disgrace and his father's anger. Absalom, who was three or four years younger than Ashen, he despised, and counted for nothing.

A man may be a good French scholar, and yet find it difficult in France to ask for things in common use. Here the Syriac is probably right in understanding, not a pan, but the delicacy Tamar had been cooking. In ver. 8 the word rendered "flour" is certainly "dough," and is so rendered in the Revised Version. The cakes were a kind of pancake, fitted to tempt the appetite of a sickly person. The picture is a very interesting one: the palace parcelled out into separate dwellings; the king kindly visiting all; the girls on friendly terms with their brothers, yet not allowed to go to their rooms without special permission; and finally Tamar's skill in cookery - an accomplishment by no means despised in an Oriental <span class="accented">menage</span>, or thought unworthy of a king's daughter.

The word folly is used in the sense of unchastity in <a href="../../par/genesis/34-7.htm">Genesis 34:7</a> and elsewhere, and it is noteworthy that the Jews thus connected crime with stupidity. Vain, that is, empty persons were the criminal part of the population (<a href="../../par/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>), and to call a man "a fool" was to attribute to him every possible kind of wickedness (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>). The thought which lay at the root of this view of sin was that Israel was a peculiar people, sanctified to God's service; and all unholiness, therefore, was not merely criminal in itself, but a proof that the guilty person was incapable of rightly estimating his privileges. Tamar urges this upon her "empty" brother, and then pathetically dwells upon their mutual shame, and, finding all in vain, she even suggests that the king might permit their marriage. Such marriages, between half-brothers and half-sisters were strictly forbidden, as tending to loosen the bends of family purity (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>); but possibly the Levitical code was occasionally violated, or Tamar may have suggested it in the hope of escaping immediate violence.

Had he possessed any dignity of character or self-respect, he would have resisted this double wrong to one so near to him, and whom he had so terribly disgraced; but he can only remember the indignant words she had spoken - her comparison of him to "the fools in Israel," and her obstinate resistance to his wishes. With coarse violence he orders her away; and when, humbled and heartbroken, she begs for milder treatment, he adds insult to the wrong, and bids his manservant push her out, am! belt the door after her. By such an order the manservant and all Amnon's people would be led to believe that she was the guilty person, and Ashen the victim of her enticements.

This is certainly not a possible translation of the Hebrew, which is probably corrupt; and though Tamar's words may have been broken and hysterical, we cannot suppose that the narrator intended to represent her sobs. The text is rendered by Philippsohn, "And she said to him respecting the evil deed, Greater is this than the other." Similarly Cahen renders it, "au sujet de ce mal." Flat as this is, no better rendering is possible; but the Vatican copy of the Septuagint has a reading which suggests the line of probable emendation: "Nay, my brother, this evil is greater than the other." It was greater because it east the reproach upon her, refused her the solace of his affection, and made her feel that she had been humbled, not because he loved her, but for mere phantasy. He has had his will, and, careless of her sorrow, he scuds her contemptuously away, indifferent to the wrong he has done her, and piqued and mortified at her indignant resistance. However much we may disapprove of Absalom's conduct, Amnon richly deserved his punishment.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-17.htm">2 Samuel 13:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this <i>woman</i> out from me, and bolt the door after her.</div><div class="comm">

This was probably a long tunic with sleeves, so woven as for the colours to form patterns like those of the Scottish tartans (see on Genesis 37:3). The next sentence is probably a note, which has crept from the margin into the text, and which literally is, "For so king's daughters, while unmarried, wore over mantles" (<span class="accented">me'ils</span>; see note on 1 Samuel 2:19). Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version so render as if the coloured chetoneth and the me'il were the same; but the meaning of the note rather is to guard against the supposition that the princess, while wearing the close-fitting long tunic with sleeves, had dispensed with the comely mantle. It is, indeed, possible that, while busy in cooking, she had laid the me'il by, and now rushed away without it. But it was the tunic with its bright colours which made both Amnon's servitor and also the people aware that she was one of the king's daughters.

He was, in fact, so indignant at her treatment as to have purposed the sternest vengeance. But this he concealed from her, and counselled patience, net merely because she would have dissuaded him from a course so full of danger to himself, but because it was the duty of both to wait and see what course David would take. Where polygamy is permitted, it is the duty especially of the brothers to defend their sisters' honour (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-31.htm">Genesis 34:31</a>). But David was both her father and the chief magistrate; and, moreover, he had been made an instrument in his daughter's wrong. They must be patient, and only if David failed in his duty would Absalom's turn come. Meanwhile, Tamar dwelt in his house desolate, as one whose honour and happiness had been laid waste. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21</a></div><div class="verse">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... was very wroth.</span> The legal punishment for Amnon's crime was "the being cut off in the sight of the people" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>). But how could David, who had himself committed crimes for which death was the appointed penalty, carry out the law against his firstborn for following his example? Still, he might have done more than merely give Amnon words of reproof. Eli had done as much, and been punished with the death of his sons for his neglect of duty (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>). The sin of David's son had been even more heartless than theirs; and could David hope to escape the like penalty? It would have been wise to have given proof that his repentance included the suppression of the crime to which his previous conduct had given encouragement. But David was a man whose conduct was generally governed by his feelings. He was a creature of warm and often generous impulse, but his character lacked the steadiness of thoughtful and consistent purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom spake...neither good nor bad.</span> (On this phrase, see <a href="../../par/genesis/24-50.htm">Genesis 24:50</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-24.htm">Genesis 31:24</a>.) Absalom's outward demeanour was one of utter indifference, concealing a cruel determination. It is strange how unlike the son was to the father.

Baal-hazor was apparently the name of Absalom's estate, situated near the town Ephraim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-19.htm">2 Chronicles 13:19</a>), which, according to Eusebius, lay about eight miles north of Jerusalem. As Ephraim was near the wilderness of Judah, it was probably the same town as that to which our Lord withdrew (<a href="../../par/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a>). The phrase <span class="cmt_word">beside</span>, literally, <span class="accented">near</span>, Ephraim, shows that it must be the town, and not the tribal territory, which is here meant. <span class="cmt_word">Two full years;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">years of days.</span>

David's court had evidently become lavish, when thus a visit from him to his son's farm would be too costly for the young prince's means; but had he so increased his present as to have made it reasonable for himself and his chief officers to go, Absalom must have deferred his crime. As it was, the invitation put David off his guard, and, forgetting the fatal consequences of his good nature in permitting Tamar's visit to Amnon, he allowed his sons to go to the festival. Nor must we blame him for his compliance. He had probably at first been full of anxiety as to the course Absalom might pursue, but  his silence and forbearance made him suppose that Tamar's wrong had not caused her brother any deep sorrow. Himself a man of warm feelings, he had expected an immediate outburst of anger, but such stern rancour persevered in for so long a time with such feline calmness of manner was beyond the range of his suspicions; and the invitation, first to himself and then to all his sons, made him suppose that Absalom had nothing but affectionate feelings toward them all.

Though Tamar's wrong was the mainspring of Absalom's conduct, yet neither he nor his men would forget that Amnon stood between him and the crown; and Amnon, entirely off his guard, never very wise at his best, and with his senses made dull by wine, seems to have fallen an easy prey. And as soon as the murder was committed, the rest of the king's sons, though all had attendants with them, fled in dismay, not knowing what might be the extent of Absalom's purpose. It is said that they fled on mules, this being the first place in which this animal is mentioned, as the word so translated in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a> really means "hot springs," and is so translated in the Revised Version. The breeding of hybrids was forbidden in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>, and probably they were procured, as were horses, by trade. Up to this time the ass had been used for riding; but now David had a favourite mule (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>), and Solomon received mules as tribute (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>).

It shows, however, how thoroughly Absalom had dissembled when thus they entirely forgot that he had a grudge against Amnon. And David, in utter misery, tears his robes, and throws himself prostrate on the ground, while his courtiers, with rent garments, stand speechless round him. But the guilty Jonadab guesses more correctly the truth. He had probably watched Absalom closely, and distrusted his silence. Nothing, perhaps, had happened to justify his suspicions, but as soon as the tidings came he divined the real meaning. And, wicked as he was, he could never have supposed that Amnon would turn upon the woman he had wronged, and insult and disgrace her. He probably imagined that Amnon really loved her, and that the matter would be patched up. But when the wretched youth acted so shamelessly, Jonadab probably felt sure that Absalom would sooner or later take his revenge.

But the mouth often expresses determination, and Jonadab may have noticed Absalom looking at his brother with compressed lips. More probably, however, it is a colloquial phrase, with no special application to Absalom; and the Syriac gives the true sense.

They briefly state that Jonadab was right; for, so far from molesting any of the rest of the king's sons, Absalom had no other thought than for his own safety. He had avenged his sister, but had at present no other sinister design. It was David's method of treating him which drove this youth, with a nature fit for treachery, into schemes of rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the hillside behind him.</span> This may mean "from the west," as, in taking the points of the compass, the Hebrews looked to the east, which would thus be "before them." Compare "the backside of the desert," that is, "the western side," in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; and "the Syrians before and the Philistines behind," that is, on the east and west (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>). But the versions differ so strangely in their renderings that they could scarcely have been made from our present text.

And as he wept, David, we may feel sure, thought of Uriah, murdered because of his own base passions, whereas Amnon had brought death upon himself by following, alas! the example of his own father. He would think, too, of the words of his sentence, that "the sword should never depart from his house." It had claimed one victim, and who could now stop the outburst of angry passions in a family which previously had dwelt in kindly friendship? Probably, too, he reproached himself for not punishing Amnon. Had he done so with sufficient severity to have satisfied Absalom, he would have saved the life of  his firstborn, and not have driven his second son into terrible crime. He had not done so because his own sins had tied his hands. Yes; David had good reason for weeping sore.

So in ver. 35 the words probably are a summary of a more circumstantial account of Absalom's doings after his young men had slain Amnon. (On Talmai and Geshur, see notes on 2 Samuel 3:3.)

But the versions (Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate) all give the verb its ordinary meaning of "ceasing," and, though there is something harsh in taking it impersonally, yet their authority is too great for us to say that such a mode of rendering it must be wrong. And if the grammar be difficult, the sense put upon the words by the versions is excellent. Literally they are, <span class="accented">As to King David, there. was a ceasing to go forth after Absalom</span>; <span class="accented">for he was comforted</span>, etc. At first he had demanded of Talmai the surrender of the offender, and, when Talmai refused, David tried other means; but in time, when his grief for Amnon was assuaged, he desisted from his efforts. But even so it required much subtlety on Joab's part to obtain Absalom's recall, which would scarcely have been the case if David's soul was longing for his son's return; and, even after his coming, David long maintained an unfriendly attitude. Amnon was his firstborn, and evidently dearly loved, but David's culpable leniency had borne bitter fruit. And again he acts without thoughtful sense of justice, and though at first he would have given Absalom merited punishment, yet gradually paternal feeling resumed its sway, unhappily only to be miserably abused. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 12"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 14"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm"><title>2 Samuel 14 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/14.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/14.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/14-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/13.htm" title="2 Samuel 13">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 14 <a href="../2_samuel/15.htm" title="2 Samuel 15">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart <i>was</i> toward Absalom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's heart was toward Absalom.</span> Again there is a diversity of view as to the right rendering. The preposition does not usually mean "toward," but "against," and is so rendered in ver. 13. The whole phrase occurs again only in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-28.htm">Daniel 11:28</a>, and certainly there implies enmity. The whole attitude of David towards Absalom is one of persistent hostility, and, even when Joab had obtained his recall, for two full years he would not admit him into his presence. What has led most commentators to force the meaning here and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-39.htm">2 Samuel 13:39</a> is the passionate burst of grief when news was brought of Absalom's death following upon the anxious orders given to the generals to be careful of the young man's life. But David was a man of very warm affections, and while this would make him feel intense sorrow for the death of a son by his brother's hand, and stern indignation towards the murderer, there would still lie deep in the father's heart true love towards his sinning child, and Absalom's fall was sad enough to cause a strong revulsion of feeling. David's grief would be not merely for the death of his son, but that he should have died so miserably, and in an attempt so shameful. Was not, too, the natural grief of a father made the more deep by the feeling that this was the third stage of the penalty denounced on his own sin, and that the son's death was the result of the father's crime? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tekoah</span>. This town, famous as the birthplace of the Prophet Amos, lay upon the borders of the great wilderness southeast of Jerusalem. As it was only five miles to the south of Bethlehem, Joab's birthplace, he had probably often heard tales of this woman's intelligence; and, though he contrived the parable himself, yet it would need tact and adroitness on the woman's part to give the tale with tragic effect, and answer the king's questions with all the signs of genuine emotion. If her acting was bad, the king would see through the plot, and only by great skill would his heart be so moved as to three him to some such expression of feeling as would serve Joab's purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-3.htm">2 Samuel 14:3</a></div><div class="verse">And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.</div><div class="comm">

There is an interesting article in De Rossi, fixing with much probability the twelfth century as the date of this error. Though Absalom subsequently (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>) complained of the lax administration of justice in the realm, yet evidently this woman had the right of bringing her suit before the king; and we may be sure that Joab would take care that nothing unusual was done, lest it should awaken the king's suspicions. But possibly there was a want of method in judicial matters, and very much was left in the hands of the tribal officers, such as we find mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-5.htm">2 Samuel 14:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I <i>am</i> indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</div><div class="comm">

In ver. 15 she rightly calls them "the people." We have thus a glimpse of the ordinary method of administering the criminal law, and find that each portion of a tribe exercised justice within its own district, being summoned to a general convention by its hereditary chief; and in this case the widow represents it as determined to punish the crime of fratricide with inflexible severity, and we may assume that such was the usual practice. The mother sets before David the other side of the matter - her own loneliness, the wiping out of the father's house, the utter ruin of her home if the last live coal on her hearth be extinguished. And in this way she moves his generous sympathies even to the point of overriding the legal rights of the mishpachah. In modern communities there is always some formal power of softening or entirely remitting penalties required by the letter of the law, and of taking into consideration matters of equity and even of feeling, Which the judge must put aside; and in monarchies this is always the high prerogative of the crown. <span class="cmt_word">And we will destroy the heir also.</span> The Syriac has the third person, "And they will destroy even the heir, and quench my coal that is left." This is more natural, but there is greater pungency in the widow putting into the mouth of the heads of the clan, not words which they had actually spoken, but words which showed what would be the real effect of their determination. There is great force and beauty also in the description of her son as the last live coal left to keep the family hearth burning. In another but allied sense David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>, marg.).

Less than this would not help Absalom's case. Instead, therefore, of  withdrawing, she represents herself as dissatisfied, and pleads for full forgiveness; and as this would be a violation of the letter of the Levitical Law, in order to remove David's supposed scruples, she takes upon herself the penalty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said, Whosoever saith <i>ought</i> unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</div><div class="comm">

Nothing short of this would serve Absalom, who already was so far forgiven as to be in no fear of actual punishment. It is remarkable that David does not hesitate finally to grant this without making further inquiry, though he must have known that a mother's pleas were not likely to be very impartial. Moreover, while in ver. 9 she had acknowledged that there might be a breach of the law in pardoning a murderer, she now appeals to the mercy of Jehovah, who had himself provided limits to the anger of the avenger of blood (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>.). He had thus shown himself to be a God of equity, in whom mercy triumphed over the rigid enactments of law. The words which follow more exactly mean, "That the avenger of blood do not multiply destruction, and that they destroy not my son." Moved by this entreaty, the king grants her son full pardon, under the solemn guaranty of an oath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-12.htm">2 Samuel 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak <i>one</i> word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</div><div class="comm">

But now he is bound by the solemn oath he has taken to her to remit the penalty; for literally the words are, <span class="accented">and by the king's speaking this word he is as one guilty, unless he fetch home again his banished one.</span> She claims to have spoken in the name of all Israel, and very probably she really did express their feelings, as Absalom was very popular, and the people saw in Tamar's wrong a sufficient reason for, and vindication of, his crime. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a></div><div class="verse">For we must needs die, and <i>are</i> as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect <i>any</i> person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither doth God,</span> etc. This translation is altogether wrong. What the woman says is, "God taketh not life [Hebrew, 'a soul'] away, but thinketh thoughts not to banish from him his banished one." Her argument is that death is the common lot, and that there is no way of bringing back the dead to life. But though death is thus a universal law, yet God does not kill. Death is not a penalty exacted as a punishment, but, on the contrary, he is merciful, and when a man has sinned, instead of putting him to death, he is ready to forgive and welcome back one rejected because of his wickedness. The application is plain. The king cannot restore Amnon to life, and neither must he kill the guilty Absalom, but must recall his banished son. The argument is full of poetry, and touching to the feelings, but is not very sound. For God requires repentance and change of heart; and there was no sign of contrition on Absalom's part. The power of the woman's appeal lay in what she says of God's nature. He is not intent on punishing, nor bent on carrying out the sentences of the Law in their stern literalness; but he is ready to forgive, and "deviseth devices" to bring home those now separate from him. There is also much that is worth pondering over in the distinction between death as a law of nature, and death as a penalty. The one is necessary, and often gentle and beneficial; but death as a penalty is stern and terrible. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-15.htm">2 Samuel 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, <i>it is</i> because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore that I am come,</span> etc. The woman now professes to return to her old story as the reason for her importunity, but she repeats it in so eager and indirect a manner as to indicate that it had another meaning. Instead, too, of thanking the king for fully granting her petition, she still flatters and coaxes as one whose purpose was as yet ungained. The king's word is, <span class="cmt_word">for rest</span> (see margin): it puts an end to vexation, and, by deciding matters, sets the disputants at peace. He is as <span class="cmt_word">an angel of God,</span> as God's messenger, whose words have Divine authority; and his office is, not to <span class="cmt_word">discern</span>, but "to hear the good and the evil," unmoved, as the Vulgate renders it, by blessing and cursing. His mission is too high for him to be influenced either by good words or by evil, but having patiently heard both sides, and calmly thought over the reasons for and against, he will decide righteously. Finally, she ends with the prayer, <span class="cmt_word">And may Jehovah thy God be with thee!</span> By such words she hoped to propitiate the king, who now could not fail to see that the errand of the woman was personal to himself.

The king really was uncertain, and asked dubiously, whereas the Authorized Version admits only of an. affirmative answer. David had seen the general drift of the woman's meaning, but she had involved it in too much obscurity for him to do more than suspect that she was the mouthpiece of Joab, who was standing by, and whose face may have given signs of a more than ordinary interest in the woman's narrative. She now frankly acknowledges the truth, but skilfully interweaves much flattery in her answer. And  her words are far more expressive than what is given in our versions. Literally they are, <span class="accented">By thy life, O my lord the king, there is nothing on the right or on the left of all that my lord the king has spoken.</span> His words had gone straight to the mark, without the slightest deviation on either side.

For <span class="cmt_word">in the earth,</span> translate <span class="accented">in the land.</span> The Hebrew has no means of distinguishing the wider and narrower significations of the word; but while the king would be flattered by the supposition that he knew all that happened in his dominions, the assertion that he knew all that was done in all the world was too broad and general to be agreeable. The Authorized Version has been misled by the thought of what an angel might know; but while it was a compliment to ascribe to the king an angel's intelligence in his own sphere, it would have been bad taste and unmeaning to ascribe to him omniscience. Nay, it is an assumption without proof that even an angel knows "all things that are in the earth."

A few manuscripts, nevertheless, support a Mas-soretic emendation (K'ri), namely, "Thou hast done this: go therefore," etc. But both the Septuagint and Vulgate agree with the written text (K'tib), and it is less flat and commonplace than the supposed emendation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-22.htm">2 Samuel 14:22</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</span> Keil concludes from this that Joab had often interceded for Absalom's pardon, and that this had made the king suspect him of being the prime mover in the affair. But this is to force the meaning, Joab now stood confessed as the person who had brought the woman before the king, and had employed her to gain a hearing. Had he been allowed to plead freely, her intervention would not have been necessary. We have seen, too, that the king's suspicions have been made in the Authorized Version much stronger than they really were. Many commentators also assume that Joab had a friendship for Absalom, but there are few traces of it in his conduct, and more probably Joab was chiefly influenced by politic motives. It was injurious to the well being of the nation that there should be discord and enmity between the king and his eldest son, and that the latter should be living in exile. The K'ri, <span class="accented">thy <span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>, placed in the margin, is to be decidedly rejected, with all other attempts of the Massorites to remove little roughnesses of grammar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-23.htm">2 Samuel 14:23</a></div><div class="verse">So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm">

It seems even as if Absalom was a prisoner in his house, as he could not leave it to visit Joab. Still, we must not assume that even kind treatment would have made Absalom a dutiful son, or weaned him from his ambitions purposes. The long plotted revenge, carried out so determinately, gives us a low idea of his character, and probably during these two years of waiting, he had brooded over David's criminal leniency, and regarded it as a justification for his own foul deed. And now, when allowed to come home, but still treated unkindly, thoughts condemnatory of his father's conduct were cherished by him. It seems, too, as if a protracted punishment is always dangerous to the moral character of the criminal. And must we not add another reason? Absalom, we may feel sure, saw with indignation the growing influence of Bathsheba over the king. A granddaughter of Ahithophel, she was sure to be an adept in those intrigues in which the women of a harem pass their time; and even if, upon the whole, we form a favourable judgment upon her character, yet undoubtedly she was a very able woman, and could have no affection for Absalom.

But we cannot believe that the king's shekel was not full weight; for to imagine this is to suppose that the king had tampered with the coinage; for the shekel was a coin as well as a weight, being originally a fixed quantity of silver. As a matter of fact, David had amassed too much silver to have need of resorting to what is the expedient of feeble and impoverished princes. Nor can we grant an error in the number; for the versions all agree with the Hebrew, so that any mistake must, at all events, be of great antiquity. Josephus says that Solomon's body guard wore long hair powdered with gold dust, and undoubtedly Absalom's hair was something extraordinary (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>). But six pounds is so enormous a weight that it is just possible that some ancient copyist has enlarged the number, to make it accord with a legend current among the people, in which this feature of Absalom's beauty had been exaggerated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a></div><div class="verse">And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name <i>was</i> Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three sons.</span> Their names are not given, because they died early (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>). Of his daughter <span class="cmt_word">Tamar</span>, named after her aunt, and, like her, possessed of great beauty, the Septuagint adds that she became the  wife of Rehoboam, and mother of Abijah. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a> we are told that Abijah's mother was "Maachah the daughter of Abishalom;" and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a> that her name was "Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah." We thus gather that Tamar married Uriel, and that it was the granddaughter of Absalom who became Rehoboam's queen. It is strictly in accordance with Hebrew custom to call Absalom's granddaughter his daughter, and, as Uriel was a man of no political importance, he is passed over, as the narrator's object was to show that Abijah's mother was sprung from the handsome and notorious son of David (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20, 21</a>).

But Joab had performed the former service for other reasons, and it does not seem as if he really had any affection for Absalom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-30.htm">2 Samuel 14:30</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire.

The versions, however, agree with the Massorites in substituting the easy phrase in the text. But few languages are so indifferent to persons and numbers as the Hebrew. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-31.htm">2 Samuel 14:31</a></div><div class="verse">Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto <i>his</i> house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joab arose.</span> This high-handed proceeding forced Joab to pay the wished for visit. But, while we cannot acquit Absalom of petulance, we must not regard his act as one of angry revenge; had it been so, Joab would have openly resented it, and he was quite capable of making even the heir apparent feel his anger. It was probably intended as a rough practical joke, which taught Joab better manners, and which he must laugh at, though with inward displeasure. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-32.htm">2 Samuel 14:32</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? <i>it had been</i> good for me <i>to have been</i> there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be <i>any</i> iniquity in me, let him kill me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If there be</span> (any) <span class="cmt_word">iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span> The word "any," wrongly inserted in the Authorized Version, as omitted in the Revised Version. It would have been monstrous for Absalom to profess innocence, with the murder of Amnon fresh in his memory; but the phrase, "if there be iniquity in me," means, "if my offence is still unpardoned." If year after year he was to be treated as a criminal, then he would rather be put to death at once. And Absalom's plea succeeds. Joab, who had been unwilling to visit the prisoner, now consents to act as mediator, reports to David his son's vexation at such long continued coldness, and obtains full pardon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-33.htm">2 Samuel 14:33</a></div><div class="verse">So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king kissed Absalom.</span> The father's kiss was, as in the case of the prodigal son (<a href="../../par/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>), the sign of perfect reconciliation, and of the restoration of Absalom to his place as a son, with all its privileges. But God's pardon was immediate (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), while David's was unwilling, and wrung from him. The kiss, we may feel quite sure, was preceded by a conversation between David and his son, the record of which is omitted simply for the sake of brevity. Evidently it satisfied the king, and ended in the kiss which gave the son all he desired. But whatever may have been his professions, Absalom's subsequent conduct is proof that he still regarded Amnon's death as a just retribution for his conduct to Tamar, and secretly cherished a sullen anger against his father for not having punished the wrong doer himself. It was the contrast between his own five years of punishment and the mere verbal reproof which was all that Amnon had to suffer for his shameless conduct, which rankled in Absalom's mind, and gave him an excuse for finally plotting his father's ruin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm"><title>2 Samuel 15 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/15.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/15.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/15-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/14.htm" title="2 Samuel 14">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 15 <a href="../2_samuel/16.htm" title="2 Samuel 16">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this.</span> The Hebrew is a more precise phrase than that on which we have commented on 2 Samuel 10:1 and 2 Sam 13:1, and implies that Absalom began his devices soon after obtaining his liberty. <span class="cmt_word">Chariots and horses;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">a chariot and horses</span>; that is, a chariot for state occasions, in which Absalom rode, while fifty footmen ran at his side.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was <i>so</i>, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city <i>art</i> thou? And he said, Thy servant <i>is</i> of one of the tribes of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the gate.</span> The gate would be that of the royal palace, where the king gave audience and administered justice. At the gate of the city the elders were the judges, and, though the higher authority of the king may have weakened the action of  this citizen court, yet passages such as Isaiah 50:23 and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> imply, not only its continued existence, but also that it retained much importance. Probably all causes between citizens were tried by it, just as causes in the country were tried by the mishpachah (see note on 2 Samuel 14:7); but with an appeal in weighty matters to the king. It is a mistake to suppose that David altogether neglected his judicial functions. On the contrary, the woman of Tekoah obtained an audience, as a matter of course; and Absalom would not have risen up thus early unless David had also taken his seat in the early morning on the royal divan to administer justice. It was the suitors on their way to the king whom Absalom accosted, and made believe that he would be more assiduous in his duties than his father, and that he would have decided every suit in favour of the person to whom he was talking, whereas really one side alone can gain the cause. Still, we may well believe that, guilty himself of adultery and murder, and with his two eider sons stained with such terrible crimes, David's administration of justice had become half hearted. And thus his sin again found him out, and brought stern punishment. For Absalom used this weakness against his father, and, intercepting the suitors on their way, would ask their city and tribe, and listen to their complaint, and assure them of the goodness of their cause, and lament that, as the king could not hear all causes easily himself, he did not appoint others to aid him in his duties. It was delay and procrastination of which Absalom complained; and as many of the litigants had probably come day after day, and not succeeded in getting a hearing, they were already in ill humour and prepared to find fault. Now, as David possessed great powers of organization, we may well believe that he would have taken measures for the adequate administration of law had it not been for the moral malady which enfeebled his will. In the appointment of Jehoshaphat and Seraiah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16, 17</a>) he had made a beginning, but soon his hands grew feeble, and he did no more.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After forty years.</span> As Absalom was born in Hebron after David was made king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>), and as David's whole reign lasted only forty years and six months, the reading "forty" is evidently incorrect. Suggestions, such, for instance, as that the forty years are to be reckoned from the desire of the Israelites to have a king, or from the anointing of David by Samuel, are merely methods of evading a difficulty. The Syriac, however, and the Vulgate - except the Codex Amiatinus, which reads "forty," supported by Josephus and some manuscripts have "four years," which would give ample, yet not too long, time for the growth of Absalom's popularity, and of dissatisfaction at David's tardy administration of justice. <span class="cmt_word">In Hebron.</span> Absalom chose this town, beth as being his birthplace, and also because it was on the road to Geshur (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>), whither flight might be necessary should the enterprise fail. He hoped also to win to his cause some of the powerful tribe of Judah, though it generally was the mainstay of David's throne. Local sacrifices were still customary (see note on 1 Samuel 16:2), and the visit of the king's son for such a purpose would be celebrated by a general holiday and much feasting at Hebron. As Ewald remarks, David's confidence and want of suspicion were the results of a noble-minded generosity. And besides, there was no state police ever on the watch, and ready to put an unfavourable construction on all that was done; and probably David was even pleased at his son's popularity, and took his professions as proof that he would be a just and wise ruler on succeeding to his father's place. Perhaps, too, he was glad at this indication of religious feeling on Absalom's part; for a father is sure to look on the better side of his son's acts. He had been tardy enough in fulfilling his vow, but it seemed to David that conscience had at last prevailed, and that right was to be done.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom sent spies.</span> The word means "those who go hither and thither," and, as the object of such journeying would usually be. to gather information, the right translation often is "spies." Here there was no such purpose, nor were they to report to Absalom, but to disperse themselves everywhere, and, when the signal was given at Hebron, they were to endeavour to gather the people to Absalom's standard. Some simple minded commentators wonder how one trumpet could be heard throughout the land. It was heard only at Hebron, but the news of the proclamation would rapidly spread; and, though the rumour might be vague and confused, yet these emissaries, fully acquainted beforehand with its meaning, would turn it to Absalom's advantage, and urge the people to confirm the choice, made, as they would affirm, by the whole tribe of Judah. In such attempts  everything depends upon gathering a powerful following at first; and usually a good deal of vigour and even force is necessary to make men take part in a revolt. But as the numbers swell, adherents readily flock in to what seems to be the winning side. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-11.htm">2 Samuel 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, <i>that were</i> called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred men.</span> These, doubtless, were courtiers and men of rank, who were so accustomed to Absalom's love of display, that, when <span class="cmt_word">called</span>, that is, invited, they would go without suspicion. To Absalom their attendance was most important, not only because, being compromised, many would join him, and even all of them for a time be forced to yield obedience, but because they would make the people of Hebron suppose that Absalom had a powerful body of supporters at Jerusalem. It is quite possible that at Hebron, and generally in Judah, there was great discontent because David had left their tribe to choose a capital elsewhere, and because he did not show them any decided preference over the other tribes, whose good will he would rightly seek to conciliate. The existence of much jealousy between Judah and the ten tribes is plain from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counseller, from his city, <i>even</i> from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahithophel the Gilonite.</span> The desertion of David by Ahithophel is in every way remarkable, even if he were Bathsheba's grandfather (see note on 2 Samuel 11:3). For he was far too subtle a man to have joined the conspiracy unless he bad felt reasonably sure that it would be successful. Successful it would have been had his advice been followed; but so correctly did he estimate the result if David were allowed time to gather his friends, that, when his counsel was rejected, he withdrew immediately to Giloh, and committed suicide. Still if the revolt had been successful, it would have involved, if not the death of Bathsheba, yet certainly that of her sons, and the exclusion of Ahithophel's great-grandchildren from the throne. In <a href="../../par/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, written at this time, we learn what were David's feelings when he heard the news of this conspiracy, and Ahithophel is the familiar friend, in whom he had trusted, and who had eaten at his table, but now raised up his heel to kick at him. In <a href="../../par/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a> the words are quoted of Judas Iscariot, of whom Ahithophel was a type in his treachery and in his death by his own hand. The translation, "sent for Ahithophel," cannot be maintained. The Hebrew is "sent Ahithophel," but for what purpose or on what embassy is not mentioned. As thus something must have dropped out of the Hebrew text, it possibly may be the preposition "for," as this gives a good sense. For Giloh, Ahithophel's town, was situated a few miles to the south of Hebron (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-51.htm">Joshua 15:51</a>), and Ahithophel had probably been working there secretly for Absalom for some time. As David's counsellor, his proper place of residence would have been Jerusalem, but the conspiracy had been kept so secret that he had been able to get away without suspicion. He is now summoned to Absalom's side, and his presence there brings in so many adherents that a rapid march on Jerusalem might have put David into their power. The Revised Version is right in translating, <span class="cmt_word">while he offered the sacrifices;</span> namely, those which he had vowed, and which were the reason given for his visit to Hebron. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a></div><div class="verse">And David said unto all his servants that <i>were</i> with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not <i>else</i> escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, and let us flee.</span> The rebellion of Absalom, and David's humiliating flight, bring out all the better parts of the king's character, and set him once again before us as a man after God's own heart. For this period is richly illustrated by the psalms which were written under the pressure of this great affliction, and which are marked by firm confidence in God, and an assured sense of the Divine nearness and protection. <a href="../../par/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. shows how poignant was his anguish at Ahithophel's treachery, but it inspired no fear: "As for me, thou up. holdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face forever" (<a href="../../par/psalms/41-12.htm">Psalm 41:12</a>). It was a firm faith which prompted such words. In <a href="../../par/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, written "in the wilderness of Judah," before David had reached the Jordan, he gives utterance to his grief at the loss of his religious privileges at Jerusalem; but Jehovah is still his strong Tower, and his dwelling will be in God's tabernacle forever. <a href="../../par/psalms/3.htm">Psalm 3</a>. and 4. are his morning and evening hymns written "when he fled from Absalom his son." <a href="../../par/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a> is one more sad even than <a href="../../par/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. He describes in it his panic stricken feelings when the news reached him, his longing to escape from the turmoil of life, and flee into the wilderness and be at rest; and his grief at his desertion by men in whose company he had worshipped in the house of God. Upon this follows an outburst of vehement indignation, made the more bitter by the sense of the treachery whereby he had been duped into connivance with Absalom's plans (ver. 21); but amidst it all his confidence was unshaken that if he cast his burden upon God, "he would sustain him, and never suffer the righteous to be moved." Finally, in <a href="../../par/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, we have the contrast between Jehovah's abiding goodness and the inconstancy of men; while <a href="../../par/psalms/61.htm">Psalm 61</a>. and 62. were probably written at Mahanaim, when David s anguish of mind was being assuaged, and a calm confidence was taking its place. Everywhere in all of them David speaks as one who had now given all his heart to God. As regards his terror and flight (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5-8</a>), it may seem strange that David should have withdrawn so hurriedly from a city so  strong as Jerusalem. But we must not suppose that he had a standing army, and his few Cherethites and Pelethites could have made no head against the nation. Probably, too, the fortifications of the city were incomplete (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>); and even if in good order, yet, cooped up in Jerusalem, David would have left the whole country in Absalom's power, and finally, after a long blockade, he must have been driven by famine to surrender. Away from Jerusalem he was the centre whither all who disliked Absalom's attempt would gather, and every day as it passed would make men reflect more and more upon what David had done for them, and the more steady and thoughtful of them would finally decide in his favour. There would be, moreover, the secret conviction that David, with such men round him as Joab and Abishai, if free to take his own course, would be more than a match for Absalom and his larger numbers. This was what Ahithophel foresaw, and was so convinced that, if David were not crushed at once, he would gain the day, that he did not even wait to see, but destroyed himself. Abarbanel thinks that the wish of the people had never been for more than the association of Absalom with David on the throne, according to what he had himself suggested (ver. 4); and that there was a great revulsion of feeling when they saw that they must choose absolutely between father and son, and that whoever lost the crown must lose his life as well. Some commentators consider that <a href="../../par/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>. also belongs to this period, though others ascribe it to Jeremiah. Parts of it are singularly applicable to the circumstances of David's flight, as where the psalmist speaks of Jehovah as being his Fortress in contrast with Jerusalem, and adds, "Thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy, but hast set my feet in a large space," as though "the net which the conspirators had privily laid for him" had been the design to coop him up within the walls of the city, There are touching words, too, of distress at the slander and reproach breaking forth on every side, and at the completeness of his fall, so that whereas but a few days before he had been a king, now "he was clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind; and east aside as though he were now of no more account than the shards of a broken vessel." But, with the calm strength of faith he adds, "My times are in thy hand;" "Thou shalt hide all who trust in thee in the secret of thy presence;" "Oh, then, love Jehovah, and be of good courage! for he shall strengthen the heart of all whose hope is fixed on him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-15.htm">2 Samuel 15:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants <i>are ready to do</i> whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king's servants.</span> These were the officers of David's court and household, numerous enough to hamper his movements, but not enough to protect him.

Here, too, the bodyguard would gather, and they would cross the Kidron only when everything was ready for their orderly progress. Confusion at such a time would breed a panic and invite an attack. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the Gittites, air hundred men which came after him from Gath.</span> The Septuagint reads "Gibborim," and without doubt these are the persons meant; but while they were styled Gibborim, the "mighties," for honour's sake, because of their prowess, they probably were popularly called David's Gittites, because they were the six hundred men who had formed his little army when he sought refuge with Achish, King of Gath (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>). They were not Philistines, but Israelites of desperate fortune (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and it is a proof of David's great ability, and of the moral influence of his character, that he was successful, not only in controlling them and maintaining discipline, but also in forming them into as noble a set of heroes as ever existed, and who were faithful to him in all his fortunes. To their number belonged the thirty-seven champions end-merated in ch. 23, and possibly the title "Gibborim" strictly belonged to them only. As they are still called "the six hundred," it is probable that the corps was maintained at this number by new appointments, and that they had special privileges which made their position very desirable. Certainly David would never forget men who had shared all his fortunes, and been so true and so useful to him; and it is evident, from Hushai's counsel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>), that Absalom feared their resolute valour, and hesitated to attack without overwhelming numbers. Thenius compares these veterans to Napoleon's Old Guard. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-19.htm">2 Samuel 15:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou <i>art</i> a stranger, and also an exile.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ittai the Gittite.</span> Ittai was not one of the six hundred, though there was an Ittai among them, a Benjamite.

He had evidently been a person of importance in his own country,  whence he had been driven, perhaps by political troubles, and was now, therefore, an exile and a foreigner (Authorized Version, "stranger") at Jerusalem. As David made him joint commander of his army with Joab and Abishai (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>), he must also have been a general of recognized military skill. As he was thus not personally interested in the government of Israel, and, in fact, had only lately come thither, David recommends him to <span class="cmt_word">return...  and abide with the king,</span> that is, with the <span class="accented">de facto</span> king, Absalom. But so great was the fascination which David exercised upon those around him, that this foreigner boldly threw in his lot with him, and accompanied him in his flight. Return to thy place.

But the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate, by "his own place" understand Gath, either taking the words as meaning "an exile as to thy own place," or having a different reading. The Hebrew then proceeds, <span class="accented">Yesterday was thy coming, and shall</span> 1 <span class="accented">today make thee wander to go with us, seeing I go whither I go?</span> that is, I go I know not whither. <span class="accented">Return thou, and take back thy brethren - in mercy and truth.</span> This gives a very good sense, but the Septuagint and Vulgate have a different reading: "Take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord chew thee mercy and truth." The Syriac gives the genera] sense of the Hebrew, rendering, "Take back thy brethren well."

Their presence with him proves that he had entirely broken with the Philistines, and left his country for good. He may have taken this step for religious reasons, though his swearing by Jehovah (ver. 21) does not prove it, as Achish did the same (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>); or Ittai, after the capture of Gath by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>), may have made himself unpopular by becoming the ally of the conqueror, and so finally have determined to leave the city, and find a home in Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a></div><div class="verse">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the country wept.</span> This general lamentation proves that David was not really unpopular in Jerusalem, though it was there that Absalom had dazzled the people by his magnificence, and sought to win favour by his gracious ways. By the <span class="accented">country</span> the inhabitants are meant, who watched the king's departure; while the <span class="accented">people</span> are David's followers - his retinue and attendants. <span class="cmt_word">The brook Kidron.</span> This is a winter torrent, dry during most of the year, but serving at the rainy seasons to carry off the rainfall from the Valley of Jehoshaphat. It lay on the east of Jerusalem, and beyond it was Mount Olivet. The direction of David's flight was toward the wild country on the east of the Jordan, in which Ishbosheth had found a refuge after the defeat of Gilboa. To reach it he must pass by Jericho, and thence through the Arabah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>) to the ford of the Jordan, after crossing which he would be in comparative safety. Ahithophel would have followed that very night, and have attacked before David had placed the river between himself and his pursuers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24</a></div><div class="verse">And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites <i>were</i> with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abiathar went up.</span> This rendering, though confirmed by the versions, is very unintelligible. Whither did Abiathar go up? And moreover it is said that he continued going up until all David's followers had passed out of the city. Another possible rendering is, "And Abiathar offered (sacrifices) until all the people had done passing out of the city." Passages quoted in proof that the verb may be so rendered without the addition of the word "sacrifice" are <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; but in both these places the context makes the sense plain. Such a sacrifice would, of course, sanctify both king and people in their flight; but as none of the versions support this method of translating the text, it seems unsafe to adopt it, and the passage must remain obscure. On the one hand, it is unlikely that there would be time to offer sacrifices at so hasty a flight; but on the other hand, the removal of the ark was a solemn thing, which probably required some such religious ceremonial, and Cahen and other Jewish authorities translate, "Abiathar offered burnt offerings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me <i>both</i> it, and his habitation:</div><div class="comm">

He feels that God will not judge him by any mere outward sign or privilege, but in truth and equity. If he deserves condemnation, he will not escape it by carrying the ark about with him. If, on the contrary, God accepts him, he will restore him to the enjoyment of his spiritual privileges, and bring him back to worship at the place which he has chosen for his dwelling. We must notice that he addresses these words to Zadok, who had remained with the ark. This was natural if Abiathar was occupied in offering, but hard to understand if he had gone up, that is, in advance of the ark, to acquaint David with their purpose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27</a></div><div class="verse">The king said also unto Zadok the priest, <i>Art not</i> thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (not) <span class="cmt_word">a seer?</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version evade the difficulty of this passage  by inserting the word "not." It is one of the merits of the Revised Version that usually it does not take these liberties. But "Art thou a seer?" is meaningless; and the attempts, moreover, to show that Zadok was a seer fail entirely in proof. The receiving revelations by Urim and Thummim was a priestly, and not a prophetic, function. Without altering the text, the words may be correctly translated, "Seest thou?" This was probably a colloquial phrase, of which the Septuagint gives the sense by rendering it in the imperative, "See;" while the Syriac, regarding it as an expletive, boldly omits it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a></div><div class="verse">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the plain of the wilderness.</span> The Revised Version has "at the fords of the wilderness," that is, it rightly keeps to the written Hebrew text (the K'tib), while the Authorized Version adopts a conjecture of the Massorites (the K'ri). This conjecture is the substitution of <span class="accented">arboth</span> for <span class="accented">abroth</span>, and they have made the same alteration at <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>. But the substitution is uncalled for and mischievous; for David would not halt indefinitely in the plain, the Arabah (of which Arboth is the plural), but would press on to the fords, where some delay must take place, and where the king's presence would be important in giving instructions for what was by no means an easy operation (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-18.htm">2 Samuel 19:18</a>). At the river, moreover, David could be assailed only in front, where his "mighties" would make a strong defence, while in the Arabah they might be surrounded; and, encumbered as they were with women, their line must be so extended as to be weakened. We find, too, in <a href="../../par/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a> that the fords of the Jordan formed a good military position. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a> it is expressly said that the fording of the river did not take place until Jonathan and Ahimaaz came with their reports; and their words there, in ver, 21, show that David was on the bank when they arrived, with his preparations so complete, that, in the next few hours, all his company were safely carried over to the other side. Ahimaaz was a famous runner (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>), and, if David was ready, the time gained by him upon any body of troops leaving Jerusalem at the same hour, would have enabled the king to get his people across; but if he had still some miles to march, with a number of women and children, Ahimaaz's fleetness would have been rendered useless.

So we in great sorrow bury our faces in our hands. In this mark of mourning all joined, but David added the going barefoot as a sign of deeper humiliation. According to the Jewish Midrash, it was upon the Mount of Olives that David composed the third psalm. More probably it was at the fords of the Jordan, after David, wearied with the fatigues of the march, had enjoyed a short refreshing slumber, and while he was waiting for his two young friends, that he comforted himself by this outpouring of his heart to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>one</i> told David, saying, Ahithophel <i>is</i> among the conspirators with Absalom.

The text is evidently corrupt, and the Authorized Version gives the right sense. On hearing of the defection of a man so famous for practical sound judgment, David prays to God to frustrate his counsel, and the opportunity for devising means for this end quickly follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-32.htm">2 Samuel 15:32</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, that <i>when</i> David was come to the top <i>of the mount</i>, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where he worshipped God;</span> more correctly, <span class="accented">where God was worshipped</span>, and so the Revised Version. The summit of the Mount of Olives was one of the many bamoth, or high places, situated on the top of hills, where, in the old Canaanitish time, men had worshipped their heathenish deities. They were still regarded as consecrated places, but the worship had now been transferred to Elohim, the true God. They continued to be hallowed spots, with Levitical priests to minister at them, until the stricter times of Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>), when such worship was forbidden; but even then these priests seem to have retained considerable privileges, though their position was inferior to that held by the priests of the temple. It was at this hallowed spot that David's old friend and privy counselor (ver. 37), Hushai, met him, <span class="cmt_word">with his coat rent</span> - not the upper garment, but the <span class="accented">kuttoneth</span>, the under tunic, the rending of which was a sign of deeper sorrow. We read of "the border of the Archites" (so the Revised Version, rightly) in <a href="../../par/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>, near Bethel, in the tribe of Manasseh; and Hushai's birthplace was probably there.

Others, with less probability, think that it was because of his rank, which would demand special attendance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a></div><div class="verse">But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; <i>as</i> I <i>have been</i> thy father's servant hitherto, so <i>will</i> I now also <i>be</i> thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</span> David was thus meeting treachery by treachery, and we cannot approve of it, even granting that Ahithophel's conduct was base and selfish,  while Hushai was risking his life for his master. Still, he was sent back to tell a falsehood, and his excuse was necessity; for Ahithophel was so sagacious that, if his counsel were not upset, David's cause was lost. It was not Christian morality, but yet it has a sort of nobleness about it in Hushai's devotion to his king. And even now, in war and diplomacy, such acts are not uncommon, and a distinction is unhappily drawn between political and social morality. Even in common life immoral doings are often sanctioned by use. Thus many customs of trade are frauds, considered legitimate because generally practised. Even among ourselves Christian morality is far below the level of our Master's teaching; and the Old Testament must not be taken as approving all that it records. Similar blame does not attach to Zadok and Abiathar. They were known to be David's friends, and had even tried to go with him, bearing with them the ark. They professed no friendship for Absalom, and returned for no covert purpose, looking for protection, not to guile, but to their sacred office. And Absalom would be glad to have them in his power, and would make them continue the customary sacrifices, and, if his rebellion proved successful, would force them to anoint him, and so give his usurpation a religious sanction. But he would tell them none of his plans, nor would they try to insinuate themselves into his confidence. They would have a perfect right to be useful in any way they could to their true master, but would do so at the risk of severe punishment. Hushai's way of defeating Ahithophel was treacherous; but there was no deceit in the young men carrying a message from him, for they were openly David's friends.

Had this advice been followed, the decisive battle would have been fought that evening at the fords of the Jordan, a few miles only from Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm"><title>2 Samuel 16 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/16.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/16.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/16-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/15.htm" title="2 Samuel 15">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 16 <a href="../2_samuel/17.htm" title="2 Samuel 17">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a></div><div class="verse">And when David was a little past the top <i>of the hill</i>, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred <i>loaves</i> of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth</span>. It is the misfortune of troubled times like those in which David found himself, that unscrupulous men use them for selfish purposes. For those in danger have no time for careful examination, nor are their minds sufficiently calm for impartial judgment, but they act on first impressions, and catch at every straw. Ziba's present would naturally raise everybody's spirits, and be taken as a good omen; for it showed that David had adherents in unlikely quarters, when thus a servant of the house of Saul of his own accord brought so timely an offering. The asses saddled for riding contradict the idea that Ziba met David by chance as he was bringing the produce of the farm for the use of Mephibosheth's household. More probably the asses had been saddled for Mephibosheth's own use (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a>), and the provisions had been prepared as a contribution to the king's needs: but at the last moment the cunning Ziba managed to hurry away with his men, leaving his master in the lurch, and unable to get anything to ride upon in the short interval between David's escape and Absalom's entry. Moreover, possibly from being a cripple, and from the distressing circumStances of his early life, Mephibosheth always seems deficient in energy, and perhaps David's conduct in mulcting him of half his property may not really have been so unjust as it looks, supposing that it was his dilatoriness which gave Ziba the chance of going away with the whole convoy while he was wasting time. It was this apparent desertion of him by one whom he had so befriended which may have made David say, "All men are liars" (<a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>), though subsequently he learned that the lie was Ziba's. The food consisted of two hundred leaves, or rather fiat cakes of bread, a hundred bunches of dried grapes, a hundred cakes of pressed dates, and a skin of wine. Instead of "date cakes," some of the versions render "fig cakes;" but for this there is a special Hebrew word (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-12.htm">1 Samuel 30:12</a>).

Mephibosheth was likely to meet with no kind treatment from Absalom; but perhaps he was a visionary, and David may have thought that he was holding back for any chance that might turn up. But upon this slander David acts with blamable impetuosity, and, indignant that the son of his old friend should so desert him, he gives Ziba all his lands. The grant would be valid only if David's cause prevailed, and Ziba so far deserves credit in that he attached himself to a ruined man; but his motive was not love to David, but selfish calculation.

Shimei could scarcely have referred to the murders of Ishbosheth and Abner, which were too remote to have so rankled in his memory; but as ch. 21. is not in its chronological order, what probably called forth his anger was the surrender of Saul's sons and grandsons into the hands of the Gibeonites. Shimei, probably, even resented David's taking the side of the Gibeonites, and treating as a crime to be severely punished what he and all Saul's partisans regarded as righteous zeal for Israel. The three years' famine, followed by the execution of Saul's sons, made more tragic by the noble conduct of Rizpah, contributed largely to the revolt of the nation from David, and helps to explain that abandonment of him by the people, which otherwise seems so hard to understand (on the date of the famine, see note on ch. 21.).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Abishai.</span> Abishai's indignation was natural, and it is evident, from ver. 10, that Joab shared it. Shimei's conduct was abominable, and David finally condemned him to death for it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-8.htm">1 Kings 2:8, 9</a>), having probably found that, even after his pardon, he was an implacable enemy. His revilings now must not only have been painful to David, but depressing to all the people that were with him, and there must have been many a murmur in the ranks at the king allowing such conduct to go unpunished. But he was in a state of great mental distress and self-condemnation. He had borne sorrow after sorrow since the day when, by his own great sin, he had opened the floodgates of wickedness; and now the son whom he dearly loved, and who had first been put wrong by a crime which might never have been committed but for his own example, was seeking both his crown and his life, and had made his cup of sorrow full to the brim and running over. At such a time of agony it was even a relief to have outward affliction to bear; for it brought the consoling thought that the Divine chastisement had its merciful limit. Jehovah had bidden Shimei revile him, and he would bear it because it was Jehovah's doing. "It may be that Jehovah will look upon my wrong, and that he will requite me good for his cursing of me this day." <span class="cmt_word">Go ever</span>. Abishai's word is explained by ver. 13. David's route seems to have lain in a narrow valley, and Shimei, running along the ridge on one side, was near enough for his words to be heard, and for his stones to come near the king's retinue. Abishai, therefore, asked permission to cross over to Shimei's side of the steep ravine with a few men, who would seize him and put him to death.

And immediately on his arrival, Hushai hastens into Absalom's presence, loudly exclaiming, "Long live the king!" for such is the meaning of the Hebrew. The young man is surprised; for Hushai was David's friend and trusted confidant. Yet he does not suspect this sudden breaking of old ties, but, looking at the bright side only, sees in it a proof that his party was looked upon as sure of success, and David's cause as hopeless. He welcomes, therefore, so notable an adherent, and Hushai's pretences confirm his self-deceit; for he professes to regard Absalom as king, not by fraud and violence, but by the formal choice of both Jehovah and the people. On this assumption, obedience to the nation's choice became a religious duty, and Hushai's love to the father was a pledge of love to the son. We must not, however, condemn Absalom for too easy credulity. The nation was in his favour, and, had he acted with promptitude, David's cause would have been lost. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Israel.</span> Here and in ver. 15 the men of Israel are not contrasted with the men of Judah, but include them (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>). Absalom's rebellion began at Hebron, in Judaea, and the selection of Amasa, a first cousin both of David and Joab, as commander-in-chief, suggests the conclusion that Absalom's chief strength lay in David's own tribe, though men from all the tribes on the west of the Jordan had also flocked to his standard. Besides them, Hushai speaks of <span class="cmt_word">this people,</span> that is, the citizens of Jerusalem. For, while there had been general lamentation at David's departure (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>), yet the citizens had admitted Absalom without a struggle, and submitted to him. David's adherents are also constantly called "the people," because they did not belong to any special tribe,  but were drawn indifferently from them all.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a></div><div class="verse">And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that <i>are</i> with thee be strong.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahithophel said.</span> Ahithophel's counsel was utterly abominable, even though the deed would not be regarded by any of the Israelites as incestuous. A king inherited his predecessor's harem, and Absalom's act was a coarse and rude assertion that David's rights were at an end, and that crown and lands and property, even to his wives, now all belonged to the usurper. But, while polygamy had thus degraded the wives and concubines into mere chattels, the harem was the property most jealously guarded by its owner (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>); and Absalom's act was an outrage which David could never have pardoned. And this was what Ahithophel wanted. He was afraid that if Absalom's cause began to decline, he might come to terms with his father, who would readily forgive a son if he submitted, but would certainly punish Ahithophel. For his own selfish purposes, therefore, he led Absalom on to a crime which rendered a reconciliation with David impossible, and pledged all the conspirators to carry out the matter to the bitter end; and that end could only be the death of David if the conspiracy succeeded. But this bitterness to David would vex all moderate men, and weaken Absalom's cause. It was of advantage only to such as were deeply committed to the rebellion, and bent on killing David. To him it was terrible sorrow; for he knew that this open shame was the punishment of his own secret infamy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11, 12</a>); and in it, again, he saw the meshes of the avenger's net tightening around him.

It was when walking on this roof that David had given way to guilty passion, and now it is the scene of his dishonour. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a></div><div class="verse">And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, <i>was</i> as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so <i>was</i> all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The counsel of Ahithophel,</span> etc. These words form a sort of apology for Absalom. He ought to have had more respect for his father than to offer him so grievous an insult, and aggravate by so terrible a deed the quarrel between them. But his conduct from first to last was utterly mean and selfish, and his only excuse here is that there was such a glamour round Ahithophel, that men yielded up their own judgment to him without an effort, and did what he advised as if it had a religious sanction. <span class="cmt_word">At the oracle of God;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">had asked the Word of God</span>; that is, had consulted God by Urim and Thummim.

Both the amendments of the text and the various translations offered are innumerable, but nothing is really more satisfactory than the literal rendering of the words, virtually given us in the Authorized Version. Naturally, Ahithophel did not wish to parade David's death too openly. In his heart Absalom must have known that the safe possession of the kingdom could be assured him only by his father's death, but yet he might have shrunk from publicly avowing this, and having it talked of before his courtiers as a settled purpose. One reason why he adopted the counsel of Hushai may have been his reluctance to commit parricide: for plainly the one main purpose of Ahithophel was David's death. This thorough traitor may have seen even a tremor of alarm in Absalom's countenance when he spake out his purpose so frankly of "smiting the king only," and may have felt that, slumbering in the besom of the son, was something of that generous spirit which had made the father condemn the Amalekite to death for boasting that he had slain Saul. At all events, he was unwilling to dilate upon so ghastly a theme, and this general reference to David, as the man whom Absalom sought, without dwelling upon the subject, is in far better taste than the coarse open villainy so unreservedly expressed in ver. 2. The reading, however, of the Septuagint has many followers: "And I will bring back all the people to thee as a bride returns to her husband, excepting the life of the one man thou seekest; and for all the people there shall be peace." Ahithophel was bad enough, but scarcely so brutal as to compare to a bridal procession the sad return of David's mourning friends and companions in arms weeping round the corpse of their master murdered at the bidding of his own son. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-4.htm">2 Samuel 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the elders of Israel.</span> Their presence seems to show that Absalom professed to act in an orderly and constitutional manner, and with the advice of those in authority. It was possibly this wish to keep up appearances which made him command Hushai to be summoned, as he was one whose advice would certainly have been asked had matters gone on in their ordinary channel. So again in vers. 14, 15, Absalom acts only with the popular consent. Very probably the royal power was gradually superseding that of the tribal authorities, and this may have made David unpopular with many of the great nobles. Absalom would thus gain many adherents by associating "elders" and "men of Israel" with him in his councils.

His main points are that David was too practised a soldier to let himself be surprised. In his adventures with Saul he and his men had been trained to hold large bodies of pursuers at bay, and evade them. The men, too, who were with him were warriors of desperate valour, whose first thought would be the king's personal safety, and to ensure this they would conceal him in some pit, some cave or ravine, safe and inaccessible by nature; or <span class="cmt_word">in some place</span> (omit the inserted word "other"), that is, in some camping place, made strong with ramparts, so as to resist the first attack. "To smite the king only" is, therefore, an impossibility; and if the attack fail, and David's mighties, in their irritation, slaughter a large number of their assailants, and a panic be the result, men will hesitate before they attack such redoubtable champions a second time. A check is fatal to a rebellion, and Absalom, was staking his chance on one hasty encounter. Better leave the decision to all Israel. Their hearts were with Absalom, and, when there has been time for them to gather in their thousands, success is certain. Their numbers will be countless as the sands on the shore, or as the dew upon the grass; while David and his heroes will shrink to so small a body as to be scarcely able to man the walls of one small city. And fighting there will be none; for the myriads of Israel will drag city and fugitives with ropes down into the nearest torrent bed, where the next floods will wash all away. There was more in this than an appeal to Absalom's vanity. If all Israel did take his side, then David's cause would soon be hopeless, and there would be no need of parricide. David's death would be the act of Israel, and not of Absalom. Evidently Absalom believed that all Israel was on his side, and his success hitherto had been so rapid as almost to justify the assumption. To us this success is almost unaccountable, but it suggests that there were great faults in David's administration. Yet even so we wonder at the existence of such general dissatisfaction. <span class="cmt_word">At this time.</span> A wrong translation.

Such ravines are common in Palestine, where the streams rush along with resistless fury after the rains, but in summer are dry (<a href="../../par/job/6-17.htm">Job 6:17</a>); and their desolate beds, bordered by precipitous cliffs, are described by Isaiah as favourite places for the cruel rites of Moloch (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>). Dragged to the edge of one of these gorges, the city, with its few defenders, would topple over, and in the next rainy season be entirely swept away. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite <i>is</i> better than the counsel of Ahithophel.

Nothing in it was left to chance, and Absalom, already at the head of such numbers as to be able to select from them twelve thousand picked men, saw himself, in fancy, marching forward with all Israel at his feet. As a matter of fact, he did advance with so large an army that David was saved only by the skilful strategy of Joab. Like other king makers, Ahithophel had put himself too forward. He asked for twelve thousand men to be placed under his command, that he might smite David, and so be, not only Absalom's counsellor, but also his commander-in-chief. Amasa and the other commanders would be displeased at this, and Absalom would feel that he was himself placed in a very secondary position. Ahithophel may have asked for the command solely because no one's presence would so ensure success as his own, but he wounded the vanity beth of Absalom and Amasa, and made them ready to listen to any other advice that might be offered. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord had appointed;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and Jehovah had commanded to bring to nought</span>, etc. So plain did it seem to the writer that Absalom's success depended upon rapid action, that nothing less than the direct interference of the Divine providence could account for the infatuation of Absalom and his counsellors.

Hushai had frustrated it for the present; but Ahithophel might urge it again, and get the necessary permission; and then David and all the people that were with him would be <span class="cmt_word">swallowed up,</span> that is, destroyed utterly, and with ease.

They were placed there because, though they would have been admitted into the city, they would scarcely have been allowed to leave it.

The word "lad" does not mean a boy; more probably he was one of the young men who formed Absalom's body guard, like the ten "lads," translated "young men," in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>, Who bare Joab's armour. It Would be his duty to seize them, but when he tried to approach them, they fled, and made their way at full speed to Bahurim, where they were saved by the shrewdness and fidelity of a woman. Two such fleet runners would have had no difficulty in outstripping a boy, but one of Absalom's young men would have roused the neighbourhood to join in the pursuit. The well in his court really signifies a cistern for storing rainwater; but it was at that time dry, and served as a convenient hiding place for the two messengers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-19.htm">2 Samuel 17:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A covering;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the cover</span>; that is, the usual cover of the cistern, which had been taken off to let the young men descend into it. Over it she spread, not <span class="cmt_word">ground corn,</span> but brayed or peeled corn (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>), probably barley groats. She was probably busy in removing the husks of the barley with a pestle in a mortar when Jonathan and Ahimaaz sought refuge with her; and thus her whole proceeding was so natural as to excite no suspicions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-20.htm">2 Samuel 17:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where <i>is</i> Ahimaaz and Jonathan?

It was, we may suppose, in the right direction, but when the pursuers had followed for some time, and caught no glimpse of the runners, knowing their swiftness of foot, they concluded that they had outstripped them. and, giving up the chase as hopeless, returned to Jerusalem. It was only when she had seen them far on their way back that she removed the cover and allowed the young priests to resume their journey. The delay, would have been fatal to David if vigorous counsel had been followed at Jerusalem; as it was, they reached David's camp without further incident, and acquainted him with Ahithophel's plan; and the king at once recognized his  danger, and without more delay, commenced at once the passage of the Jordan, and carried it out so skilfully and rapidly, that by the morning every one of his company was safe on the other side. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-21.htm">2 Samuel 17:21</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</div><div class="comm">

But the act seems mentioned as a proof of Ahithophel's unerring judgment. Indignation at Absalom's folly, and at the slight. cast upon himself, is not a sufficient reason for so violent a deed. He must have foreseen the certain ruin of the conspiracy if David was allowed time; and he knew that upon its failure would follow his own punishment. It is proof also that he was a fierce and ill-tempered man, and animated for some reason or other with a malignant hatred of David. The parallel between Ahithophel and the traitor Judas must strike every one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a></div><div class="verse">Then David came to Mahanaim.

It was now a fortified city, with walls and gates (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>), and its strength of position, which had made it a safe capital for Ishbosheth, who had probably added to its defences, made it also a safe retreat for David while gathering his forces. As it was only about fifty miles distant from the fords of the Jordan, David had not retreated far; and, meanwhile, Absalom was wasting time in gathering "all the men of Israel" for the attack. During this interval Absalom was anointed king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>) by the priests, with all due solemnity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa <i>was</i> a man's son, whose name <i>was</i> Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ithra an Israelite.</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a> he is called "Jether the Ishmeelite." The first name is the same, Ithra being the emphatic form of Jether; and as it is difficult to find a reason for mentioning so ordinary a fact as that his father was an Israelite, we may conclude that "Ishmeelite" is the correct reading. Bishop Wordsworth, however, suggests that "Israelite" was in contrast to "Judahite;" but this distinction did not come into use until after the disruption of the kingdom. The Vatican text of the Septuagint has "Jezreelite," which is probably a conjecture to get rid of the obvious error of calling him an Israelite. Amasa was an illegitimate son, which confirms the reading "Ishmeelite" in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>, as a marriage between Abigail and a foreigner would be sure to be opposed by all the members of Jesse's family. <span class="cmt_word">Nahash</span>. Jewish interpreters regard Nahash (equivalent to "serpent") as another name for Jesse, quoting in proof, "Out of the root of Nahash (the serpent) shall come forth the basilisk" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>), which in the Chaldee Paraphrase is explained as meaning, "out of the root of Jesse shall come forth the Messiah." This conceit would scarcely have deserved mention, had it not found a place in the margin of the Authorized Version. Some few commentators regard Nahash as a woman's name, and think that she was a wife of Jesse, and mother of Abigail and Zerniah, but not of David. But Nahash is so constantly a man's name that it is easier to believe that Nahash was the first husband of David's mother, and Abigail and Zerniah his half-sisters, not on the father's, but on the mother's side. Joab and his brothers are always described as sons of Zeruiah, both to mark their relationship to David, and also because the rank was on her side. Amasa was probably the Amasai mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a> as bringing a powerful reinforcement to David while at Ziklag; but the ambition of supplanting Joab made him now forget David's long friendship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-26.htm">2 Samuel 17:26</a></div><div class="verse">So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shobi</span>. It is evident that the most powerful chieftains in Gilead were on David's side, and supported him with men as well as with provisions. Adherents, too, would constantly cross the Jordan, and gather round the old king; and thus, when Absalom arrived, he found himself in face of an army estimated at about twenty thousand men. Among these chiefs it is interesting to find Shobi, son of Nahash, the Ammonite king, and David's friend (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). When Hanun, the elder son, on succeeding to the throne, brought ruin upon himself by his misconduct to David's ambassadors, Shobi apparently remained faithful to David, and received the grant of a district in Gilead, where he settled with his followers. Some, with less probability, suppose that he had withdrawn to Gilead in the lifetime of his father, to be out of Hanun's way. <span class="cmt_word">Machir</span> was the generous man who had given the crippled son of Jonathan a refuge (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>); and David's honourable treatment of Mephibosheth may have won his patron's heart. Of <span class="cmt_word">Barzillai</span>, and his abode, <span class="cmt_word">Rogelim</span>, nothing more is known than what is said here, and in the very interesting narrative in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31</a>, etc. David's lasting gratitude to him is shown by his care for his sons (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-7.htm">1 Kings 2:7</a>). A clan of priests called themselves "the children of Barzillai," and claimed to be the descendants of his daughter. They could not, however, produce their genealogy, and were therefore degraded from the priestly office (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61-63</a>). Their claim, nevertheless, is a proof that Barzillai was a little king in Gilead, when thus a priestly race thought their alliance with him so honourable as to make them forget that they were of the lineage of Aaron.

The Bedaween, after removing the butter, make a kind of cheese from the remaining milk. It is as hard as the cheese made from skimmed milk in Dorsetshire, but wholesome. It must, however, be soaked before eating, or softened with butter. Generally in the East, cow's milk is regarded as coarse, and camel's milk is used for drinking, while that of sheep and goats, and cheese made from it, holds the next place in general estimation. It is curious that "butter" literally means "cheese of kine." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm"><title>2 Samuel 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/17.htm" title="2 Samuel 17">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 18 <a href="../2_samuel/19.htm" title="2 Samuel 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-1.htm">2 Samuel 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">And David numbered the people that <i>were</i> with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David numbered.</span> The verb really means that he organized his army, and arranged it in companies and divisions. As Absalom gathered all Israel to him, there would be some delay; and David, like a wise general, made use of it for training the brave but undisciplined men who had joined him, chiefly from Gilead. Besides these, he had with him numerous veterans, whose skill and experience would be invaluable in such service. The result was that when the rebels came to close quarters, they had a vast body of men, but David a disciplined force, which, under skilful generalship, scattered Absalom's raw levies with ease. The arrangement into thousands and hundreds was in accordance with the civil divisions (<a href="../../par/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>), both being, in fact, dictated by nature as multiples of our hands.

But the Israelites had no settled rule upon the point, and. when occasion required, Joab divided his army into two parts (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9, 10</a>). The reason of the threefold division in this case was that Ittai had brought his clan, or <span class="accented">taf</span>, with him, and as these would certainly not have fought under an Israelite leader, nor the Israelites under Ittai, David placed all foreigners under his command, while he gave his own nephews the command of the native troops. He thus avoided all jealousies; and Ittai's men, honoured by being made a distinct portion of the army, would feel their reputation at stake, and would rival the Israelites in valour.

But while they partly urge personal considerations, their chief argument is that David would be of more use if, posted with a body of troops at the city, he held himself in reserve to succour any division that might be in danger. And David, seeing how earnest their wish was, yielded to this representation, feeling that it would give steadiness to his men if they knew that so experienced a general was watching the fight, and was ready to succour them if they needed aid. As the people say that it would not matter "if half of us die," and that David "is worth ten thousand of us," Ewald draws the reasonable conclusion that their whole number was about twenty thousand men. The Hebrew literally is, "For now (<span class="accented">attah</span>) as us are ten thousand," which might mean, "There are ten thousand such as we are, but no one like thee." But the Septuagint and Vulgate read, "But thou (<span class="accented">attah</span>) art as ten thousand of us." The Syriac, however, like the Hebrew, reads "now."

So in ver. 12 the man says to Joab, "In our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai," etc. It does not follow that each one heard the sound of the king's voice, but only that the command was given publicly again and again, and in the presence of the army. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a></div><div class="verse">So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wood of Ephraim.</span> There is a diversity of opinion as to the locality thus described. It might mean the large forest tract in the highlands of Ephraim; but if so, the battle must have been fought on the west of the Jordan, whereas the general tenor of the narrative makes it plain that it took place on the eastern side, near Mahanaim. It is true that no wood of Ephraim is ever mentioned elsewhere in the Bible as situated in Gilead, and those who cannot believe in such a wood except within the borders of the tribe, argue that, after the three divisions had marched out to battle, there was long skirmishing, in which Absalom drew David's men across the Jordan, and there gave battle. But Absalom's army was evidently surprised, and as we are told that "he pitched in the land of Gilead" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-26.htm">2 Samuel 17:26</a>), for him to have retired would have been a confession of weakness; and Joab, after seeing him cross the Jordan, would not have followed him, but let this retrograde movement have its effect upon his followers. Such a movement is absolutely incredible on the part of an army at least three times as numerous as those whom they attacked, and confident of victory. Moreover, armies in those days were not composed of men receiving pay, and bound to remain with their colours, but of yeomen unwilling to be kept long absent from their farms, and liable, therefore, rapidly to melt away. A quick decision was plainly necessary for Absalom, while David could afford to wait. But besides this, when his forces moved out of Mahanaim, David took his post at the gate with the reserves, and he was still there, sitting "between the two gates," when news was  brought him of the victory (ver. 24). The only real argument in support of the view that the battle was fought on the west of the Jordan is that "Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain" (ver. 23), Hebrew, the <span class="accented">kikkar -</span> a name specially given to the valley of the Jordan near Jericho. But then Cushi must also have run through the same valley, and it is evident that his route was in this very respect different from that taken by Ahimaaz. Really, <span class="accented">kikkar</span>, which in Hebrew means "circuit," may be used of the country round any city, and is applied in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-28.htm">Nehemiah 12:28</a> to the environs of Jerusalem. Here the meaning probably is that, while the Cushite took the route back over the battlefield through the wood, Ahimaaz went to the left of it, over the more level ground, nearer the Jordan. And though the name is chiefly used of that part near Jericho, it was probably applied popularly to every stretch of level ground near the river. This argument, therefore, is inconclusive; while, on the other side, it is plain that David's army returned that same day to Mahanaim, that they knew at once of his distress, and that they were beginning to steal away home when Joab made David come forth to thank them, and encourage them to remain with him. The most probable explanation of the difficulty is that "the wood of Ephraim" was so called because it was the spot where Jephthah defeated the Ephraimites when they invaded Gilead to punish him for daring to go to war without their consent, they being then the dominant tribe, to whose arbitrament belonged all imperial matters (<a href="../../par/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4-6</a>).

But the noun is right: "The battle became a scattering," that is, it was a series of disconnected encounters, in which David's three divisions attacked and routed Absalom's men, while still on the march, without giving them an opportunity of collecting and forming in order of battle. <span class="cmt_word">And the wood devoured more people that day thin the sword devoured.</span> The woodland was difficult, full of gorges and begs and steep defiles leading down to the Jordan, and the fugitives easily lest their way in it, and wandered about till they were hopelessly entangled in thicket and morass. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that <i>was</i> under him went away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom met the servants of David.</span> The verb means that he came upon them by chance. Evidently in the intricacies of the forest, Absalom. had lost his way, and, finding himself suddenly in damager of being captured by some of David's men, he urged his mule through a thicket, as the open ground was blocked by his pursuers. But in the attempt his head was jammed between the boughs of a great terebinth, and the mule, struggling onward, left him hanging in mid-air. Nothing is said about his hair having caused the accident, and apparently it was his neck which became fixed. Probably, too, he was half stunned by the blow, and choked by the pressure; and then his hair would make it very difficult for him to extricate himself. And so, after one or two efforts, in which he would be in danger of dislocating his neck, he would remain suspended to await his fate. Now, this adventure makes the whole affair perfectly plain. Absalom was riding his mule, evidently unprepared for battle. The chariot and horses, with fifty men as his body guard, used by him at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>:l), are nowhere near him. Chariots, of course, would have been useless on such rough ground, but Absalom would have had a picked body of young men round him in the battle; and mules were only for use on the march, and were sent into the rear when the fighting began. But the last thing that Absalom expected was that he should be attacked on the march. He was advancing with an army infinitely more numerous than that of David, and assumed that David would wait at Mahanaim, and, if he fought at all, would fight under its walls. His defeat he regarded as certain, and then the vain glorious prince and all Israel would drag the city into the nearest ravine. In this over confidence he was riding in advance of his army, which was struggling on over most difficult ground. For "rising as the country does suddenly from the deep valley of the Jordan, it is naturally along its whole western border deeply furrowed by the many streams which drain the district; and our ride," says Canon Tristram, "was up and down concealed glens, which we only perceived when on their brink, and mounting from which on the other side, a short canter soon brought us to the edge of the next" (Tristram, p. 462). Struggling along over such ground, Absalom's men were not merely tired and weary, but had lost all order, and "become a scattering," and probably Absalom had cantered on in order to find some suitable spot for reforming them. Suddenly he sees at a little distance before him one of the three detachments of David's army, which had marched out a few miles from Mahanaim, and posted themselves on some fit spot to attack the rebels on their march. Apparently they caught no glimpse of him, but he immediately became aware of the tactics of the king's generals, and discerned the extreme danger of his position. Everything depended upon celerity. If he could warn his men, the foremost would halt until the others came up, and a sufficient force be gathered to  resist Joab's onslaught. There was no cowardice on his part, but simply the discharge of his duty as a general. He turns his mule round, and dashes away in order to halt and form his men, keeping to the wood that he may not be seen. In his great haste he is not careful in picking his route, and possibly his mule was stubborn, and swerved; and so, in attempting to force his way through the thicket, he is stunned by a blow from a branch of a terebinth tree, and so entangled in its boughs that he cannot free himself; and as none of David's men had seen him, he might have hung there to be the prey of the vultures, and only his riderless mule have been left to bear witness to his having met with some disaster. Meanwhile his followers struggle on, until they come upon David's men, who put them to the sword. There is no battle, but the three divisions, advancing in order, make merciless slaughter of their opponents. For some time Absalom's forces, extended over many miles of march, do not even learn what is going on in their front, and twenty thousand men had fallen before, becoming aware of their defeat, they fly in wild confusion, to lose more men in their panic than had fallen in fighting. Their loss would even have been greater had not Joab stopped the pursuit upon Absalom's death. But where was Amasa, and what was he doing? He had led his troops miserably, had taken no precautions against surprise, and did nothing to rally them. Had Absalom got back in safety to the van, he might have saved his men from so disastrous a defeat; but Amasa, doubtless a brave soldier, proved himself quite incompetent to the duties of a commander-in-chief, and no match for the sagacious Joab.

Absalom's death was well deserved, and there can be little doubt that, if he had gained the victory, he would have massacred David and all his family. The dishonour done to his father at Jerusalem was even intended by Ahithophel to render all reconciliation impossible. But Joab was disobeying the king's express orders, and as Absalom was incapable of making resistance, he ought to have taken him prisoner, and left it to David to decide what his punishment should be.

Not only was the man faithful to the king, but he was perfectly aware of Joab's unscrupulous character. If only Absalom were put out of the way, Joab would have readily consented to the execution of the unimportant person who had been the means of gratifying his wish.

The weapons of the ancients were of a very inferior kind, and stakes sharpened at the end and hardened in the fire were used by the infantry, until the increasing cheapness of iron made it possible to supply them with pikes. Joab's act was not one of intentional cruelty, but, picking up the first weapons that came to hand, he hurried away to kill his victim. His thrusts with these pointed sticks were brutal, and inflicted mortal wounds; but as they were not immediately fatal, Joab's armour bearers, who had followed him, and who had with them Joab's own better weapons, were called upon to put an end to Absalom's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">His heart</span> does not mean that organ anatomically, but the middle of his body.

Such cairns were used as memorials of any event deemed worthy of lasting remembrance, but the similar cairn piled over the dead body of Achan (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>) makes it probable that the act was also intended as a sign of condemnation of Absalom's conduct. <span class="cmt_word">All Israel fled every one to his tent.</span> The Israelites were still a pastoral people, with tents for their abodes, though houses were gradually taking their place. The cry, "To your tents, O Israel!" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), meant, "Go away to your homes!" and not "Gather for war!" It is remarkable how constantly Absalom's followers are described as "Israel" while the loyal men are "David's  servants." Absalom's was evidently the popular cause, and, besides Uriah's murder, there must have been political reasons for discontent at work to make David's government so distasteful.

The three unnamed sons mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a> seem to have died in their infancy, and probably also their mother; and Absalom, instead of taking other wives to bear him sons, which would have been in unison with the feelings of the time, manifested his grief by raising this monument.

This is not a proper name, but signifies that he was an Ethiopian in Joab's service. Joab was unwilling to expose Ahimaaz to me king's displeasure, and we gather from ver. 27 that the sending of a person of low rank would be understood to signify evil tidings. The bearer of good news received a present, and therefore the passing over all Joab's personal friends to send a slave was proof that the message was not expected to bring the bearer honour or reward. And Joab was quite right in supposing that David would be more displeased at his son's death than pleased at the victory.

The large slaughter of twenty thousand men (ver. 7) proves that the defeated rebels were vigorously followed. In carrying the news he evidently went back by the route which the troops had followed; while Ahimaaz took a longer course to the west, but one that avoided the tangles and the deep defiles of the forest. Strictly, the Kikkar, as we have seen, was the name of the Jordan valley near Jericho; but it was probably applicable also to the same sort of formation further north. On approaching Mahanaim, Ahimaaz would strike inland, and the two routes would join one another; and one reason which made Ahimaaz go more to the west was that he did net wish the Cushite to know that he had a rival. He would thus go at a steady pace, picking his way through the forest, while Ahimaaz was using his utmost speed.

The whole is told so vividly that we can scarcely doubt that we have here the words of one who was present at this pathetic scene, who saw the tremor which shook David's body, and watched him as he crept slowly up the stairs, uttering words of intense sorrow. And it was conscience which smote him; for his own "sin had found him out."

Nor would it be easy for us to understand his conduct during the flight from Jerusalem, and in bearing Shimei's imprecations so tamely, did we not find in the psalms written at this time that David was suffering extreme and even excessive self-reproach and mental anguish at his past sin. It was a relief to bear Shimei's rudeness, for God might remember it for good. Racked thus with self-reproach, he had urged upon his generals to spare the young man (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>), whose sin was part of a web which he had himself begun to spin, and in terror he waited for the result. Mentally it would have been better for him if he had gone to the battle instead of sitting in gloomy self-reproach between the gates. His eager inquiries, "Is the lad safe? meant - Has the hand of justice again smitten me? and when he found that a second blow had fallen, his self control gave way. Joab, more statesmanlike, and with his personal feelings unmoved, notices the fresh wrong that David is committing, and is vexed at seeing his brave warriors slink into Mahanaim ashamed, instead of being welcomed with deserved praise. But their conduct in being so depressed at David's sorrow is a proof of their affection for him, and it was plainly his duty to master his feelings, and to think of making a due return for the great service they had rendered him. The Hebrew word "salvation," that is, deliverance, gives the better side of the idea, while "victory" is a coarser word, taken from the language of a people whose trade was war.

But what he says is true, namely, that Absalom's success would inevitably have been followed by the massacre, not only of David himself,  but of his sons and daughters, and of the women who had accompanied him in his flight. Nor would it have stopped there. but the officers of his court, the captains of his army, his mighties, and all who had long eared for and loved him would have been put to the sword. It was this horrible certainty, according to Oriental usage, which made Absalom's rebellion so abominable, and which steeled the heart of Joab against him when he saw him hanging in the tree. He regarded him as a fratricide and parricide, who had plotted murder on a large scale; and Joab was not made milder by the thought that this would have included himself and the heroes who had made David's throne so great. With stern good sense he, therefore, bids the king suppress his mere personal feelings, and leave the chamber in which he had concealed himself, to go forth and "speak to the heart of his servants," that is, thank and praise them in a friendly manner. For otherwise they would disperse and leave him; and this would be followed by the uprise of some other claimant of the throne - some relative, perhaps, of Saul, backed by the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim; and David, abandoned by the nation, would fall an easy victim, with all his family, of this second rebellion. Absalom's rapid success proved that David had many enemies, and without great prudence he might be left at Mahanaim as powerless as Ishbeshoth had been. The long delay between the death of this puppet king and David's appointment to be sovereign of all Israel was probably owing to the same want of enthusiasm for David which had made the nation transfer its allegiance so lightly to the handsome Absalom. But with all his good sense Joab was coarse and rude. He was, moreover, utterly incapable of understanding David's real feelings. He saw only a father giving way to an exaggerated loss for a handsome but worthless son. David really was condemning himself for having brought lust and murder into his own house by abominable sin.

Probably they passed in review before him, and received his thanks. By thus acting in accordance with Joab's wise counsel, David probably saved the nation from years of anarchy, and a fresh civil war. <span class="cmt_word">For Israel had fled every man to his tent;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and Israel</span>, that is, Absalom's partisans, fled each <span class="accented">man to his tent</span> - to his home. The Authorized Version confounds Israel with David's soldiers, but consistently throughout the narrative "the hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>; and see 2 Samuel 16:15, 18; 17:14, 15, 24, 26; 18:6, 7, 16, 17).

With this anointment there must also have been a formal renunciation of David's rule, and, being thus dethroned, he does not attempt to return until the nation summons him back. As the flight of David narrated in ch. 16. was extremely hurried, the conspirators must have kept their counsel well, and whatever rumours reached him apparently he disregarded. But meanwhile representatives of the tribes secretly convened at Hebron had claimed to act in the name of Israel, and, chosen a new king. The words certainly imply that, had Absalom lived, the Israelites would have considered themselves bound to obey him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a></div><div class="verse">And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, <i>even</i> to his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar.</span> The two high priests had remained behind at Jerusalem, to watch over David's interests, and he now, by a messenger, probably Ahimaaz or Jonathan, urges them to quicken the proceedings of his own tribe. We may feel quite sure that there was discussion in Judah as well as in the other tribes; but the rebellion had begun at Hebron, and probably many of the leading chiefs were deeply implicated in Absalom's proceedings. Probably they now regretted it, but hung back through fear of punishment. It was politic, therefore, to assure them of David's kindly feelings, and that overtures on their side would be readily received, and the past forgiven.

It is difficult to understand why in the Authorized Version this common metaphor in the Hebrew has been so meddled with, Ewald thinks that this purposed degradation of Joab and the substitution of Amasa in his stead was a wise and politic act. It was to some extent just, for Joab was a man stained with many murders; but politic it was not. Passing over the fact that Amasa had actually taken the command of the rebel army, he was an ambitious and selfish man, and could lay no claim to that sturdy fidelity which had characterized Joab throughout his long service. For all he had done had been for David's good, and his advice, however roughly given, had averted grave misfortunes. Joab's murder of Absalom was an act of wilful disobedience; but David had used Joab for a far meaner murder, committed, not for reasons of statesmanship; but for purposes  of lust. The guilt of slaying Absalom was as nothing compared with that of slaying Uriah, nor was it so base as the assassination of Abner, which David had tolerated, though made angry by it. The dismissal of Joab could have been effected only by putting him to death, and this certainly he did not deserve at David's hands; and the attempt, unless carried out secretly, would have led to tumult and insurrection. Joab, too, was a far more skilful general than Amasa, who, with larger forces, had just suffered a disastrous defeat; and if Joab was removed secretly, his brother Abishai remained to avenge him. David was, in fact, blinded by love for the son whom for so many years he had treated with coldness. There was a strong reaction now in the father's mind, and under its influence he was prepared to sacrifice the nephew who had been faithful to him and saved him, for the nephew who had joined in Absalom's rebellion. But possibly it had an immediate good effect, as Amasa, assured of forgiveness and promotion, now took David's side. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-14.htm">2 Samuel 19:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as <i>the heart of</i> one man; so that they sent <i>this word</i> unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he bowed,</span> etc. It was not Amasa, but David, who made all the members of his tribe unanimous in his recall. And not only were the high priests active in his cause, but David, He may feel sure, sent numerous messages to all the more powerful men, assuring them of forgiveness and favour. In his general policy he was right. After the solemn anointing of Absalom, it was necessary for him to wait until some equally public and national act authorized his resumption of the royal power; and delay was dangerous. Every day now spent at Mabanaim might give the opportunity for fresh troubles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15</a></div><div class="verse">So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span>. As Gilgal lay upon the west bank of the Jordan (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>), near Jericho and the fords, it was a convenient place for the elders of Judah to await there the king. During the crossing, two interesting events happened - the meeting of Shimei and David, and the leave taking of Barzillai the Gileadite. Shortly afterwards came the apology of Mephibosheth but it is uncertain whether he was among those who had come to Gilgal to welcome the king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which <i>was</i> of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shimei the son of Gera.</span> The fact that he came attended by a thousand men of the tribe of Benjamin is a proof, not only that he was a person of influence, but that he had exerted himself to bring over his tribesmen to David's side. His adherence was, therefore, of importance. Ziba had always professed allegiance to David, and as he virtually represented the house of Stud, his presence was also valuable, even if prompted by the desire to keep Mephibosheth's land. For though Absalom seemed to be the nation's choice, yet there would be many legitimists who would consider that the crown belonged to Saul's heirs, and who would watch the course of events for any opportunity favourable to their views. David's victory ruined their hopes, and the public acts of Shimei and Ziba removed all fear of public disturbance on the part of Saul's friends. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>there were</i> a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They went over Jordan before the king</span>. This might mean that, in bringing the king across, Shimei and the Benjamites led the way. But, first, the verb, which is a rare one, means that they dashed through the river impetuously; and secondly, <span class="accented">before the king</span>, means "in the king's presence." While the tribe of Judah remained on the left bank to receive the king on his landing, Shimei and Ziba sought favour by a show of excessive zeal, and forded the Jordan, so as to be the first to welcome him (see ver. 20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-18.htm">2 Samuel 19:18</a></div><div class="verse">And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good.

Some commentators do take this view, but it is contradicted by the latter part of ver. 17. Really the Hebrew words signify no more than "at his crossing the Jordan," that is, at some time or other during the passage. Shimei's course was not only the boldest, but also the wisest. For, in the first place, his prompt surrender would commend itself to David's generosity; and, secondly, had Abishai's counsel been taken, it would have offended the thousand Benjamites who formed his escort, and also all the warriors present there from Israel (see ver. 40). Trouble and discontent would certainly have followed upon any attempt on David's part to punish any of his enemies, and there might even have been armed resistance to his crossing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-19.htm">2 Samuel 19:19</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</div><div class="comm">

Strictly, "the house of Joseph" signified the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="../../par/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22, 35</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/78-67.htm">Psalm 78:67</a>), and in this sense Shimei did not belong to it. But Ephraim claimed a supremacy over all Israel; and one cause of the opposition to David certainly was the transference of the leadership to the tribe of Judah. Even the long reign of Solomon failed to weld the tribes together, and as soon as the reins of power fell into the weak hands of Rehobeam, an Ephraimite.  Jeroboam, whom Solomon had made "ruler ever all the charge of the house of Joseph" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>), quickly wrested the ten tribes from him. In <a href="../../par/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a> "the house of Joseph" signifies all the northern tribes, for the reason given in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>; and such is its sense here. And Shimei compressed many powerful arguments in the phrase. For as a Benjamite he offered David the allegiance of the tribe which had given Israel its first king; while, as an Israelite, he professed also to represent the leading house of Ephraim, and all the northern tribes which usually followed its bidding. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-21.htm">2 Samuel 19:21</a></div><div class="verse">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?</div><div class="comm">

It probably means "one who would do me harm." Though David speaks of the sons of Zeruiah in the plural (as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>), there is no reason to suppose that Joab shared in Abishai's impetuosity. Indifferent as he was to the shedding of blood, he was too prudent and politic to put the people out of temper by an execution on the day of David's return. <span class="cmt_word">In Israel... over Israel.</span> There is much force in this repetition. A short time before Israel had been for Absalom, but now, by Shimei's submission, and that of the large body of Benjamites with him, David felt that once again he was king over the whole people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king sware unto him.</span> David's magnanimity was not the result merely of policy, but also of joyful feeling at seeing all the tribes so readily welcome him back to the throne. But in spite of his oath, he orders Solomon to execute him, regarding what he had done as a sin past forgiveness. In so doing we can hardly acquit David of breaking his oath, even granting that Shimei's repentance was insincere, and that the motive of his actions was the desire simply to save his life. But we must remember that our Lord described his injunction, "that ye love one another," as "a new commandment" (<a href="../../par/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34</a>); and the utmost that can be said in David's favour is that his character was generous and full of chivalry. A half excuse may be found for his order in the supposition that Shimei was an inveterate conspirator, and dangerous to Solomon's peace. This view seems confirmed by the command given to Shimei to build a house at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-36.htm">1 Kings 2:36</a>), where he would always be under surveillance. But had not David himself praised the man who "sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not" (<a href="../../par/psalms/15-4.htm">Psalm 15:4</a>)? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24</a></div><div class="verse">And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came <i>again</i> in peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mephibosheth</span>. The meeting of David and Mephibosheth possibly took place at Jerusalem (see on ver. 25), and, if so, the order of events is not chronological. Ziba certainly came to the Jordan fords, and the narrative may have been introduced here to complete the account of his doings. In neglecting his person and his dress, Mephibosheth was showing signs of heartfelt sorrow, and as he thus mourned during Absalom's tenure of power, it exposed him to the usurper's displeasure, and was a public avowal that his sympathies were with David. And his treatment was unjust; but David was in a strait. Ziba had been actively useful to him in his flight, and had also aided greatly in his recall. It was, probably, even owing to his influence that Shimei came with a thousand men of Benjamin. He deserved, therefore, a reward, but not at his master's cost. <span class="cmt_word">His beard;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the upper lip</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17, 22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-25.htm">2 Samuel 19:25</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king.</span> This certainly looks as if the meeting took place at Jerusalem, and apparently when David had reached the royal palace (see ver. 30). But what, then, is meant in ver. 24 by his "going down" to meet the king? If, too, he had been at Jerusalem all the while, how could he come there? Some, therefore, translate, "Then Jerusalem came to meet the king" - a possible, but not a natural, rendering, nor one that agrees with ver. 30. Others consider that he had withdrawn to his house in the highlands of Benjamin at Gibeah of Saul; but David had given these lands to Ziba, and the crippled Mephibesheth would have met with rough treatment had he endeavoured to contest the ownership. The Arabic Version reads. "when he came from Jerusalem;" but it is not confirmed by any trustworthy authorities. The view of Kimchi is probably right, that Mephibosheth did go down to the Jordan fords to meet David, and certainly his duty required of him no less. He had been slandered and ill used, but the king believed him to be guilty, and regarded him with displeasure. To have remained, therefore, at home when all Judah and half Israel had gone to welcome David back, would have been culpable remissness. And though he was lame, yet the ride was not so long as to be very fatiguing. But he did not rush through the river, as Shimei and his thousand men had done; and when David had crossed, there was too much going on for him to get an audience. He followed, therefore, in David's suite; but in Jerusalem the meeting actually took place. Thus the verses briefly record different facts: ver. 24 that Mephibosheth went with the vast crowd to welcome the king back; ver. 25 that in due time, in Jerusalem, the explanation was given, and Mephibosheth restored to favour.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a></div><div class="verse">And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant <i>is</i> lame.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass.</span> This would mean, "Thy servant purposed, said within himself, that he would saddle an ass, not by his own hands, but by those of his servants." All the versions, however, except the Chaldee, read, "Thy servant said to him, Saddle me an ass." With this agrees the narrative in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>. Mephibosheth ordered Ziba to saddle for him an ass, and one for an attendant, and to put hastily together a supply of food for the journey. And Ziba does so; but when everything is ready, he leaves his master in the lurch, and carries all away to David, to whom he falsely represents Mephibosheth as a traitor. In the words that follow, he unreservedly submits himself to David, on the ground that, though innocent in this affair, yet that, as a member of a dethroned dynasty, his life was forfeit (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>), and that, in permitting him to live, and placing him among his friends, the king had done him an act of grace.

The decision was not equitable, and David speaks in a curt and hurried manner, as though vexed with himself for what he was doing. As a matter of fact, Ziba's treachery had been most useful to David. Besides the pleasure at the time of finding one man faithful, when "all men were liars" (<a href="../../par/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>), Ziba had been most active in bringing over the tribe of Benjamin to David's side; and though his motives were selfish and venal, yet, as the king reaped the benefit of his conduct, he was bound not to leave him without reward.

Though outwardly they profess to regard the loss of the property with indifference, as compared with the joy of the king's return, yet this sort of "I don't care" answer usually covers anger. Blunt's arguments ('Undesigned Coincidences,' p. 157, etc.), to show that Mephibosheth really was a traitor, are ingenious, but not convincing.

What Barzillai wished was that, when death overtook him, it should find him in the old abode of his family, where his father and mother had died, and where their tombs were. This regard for the family sepulchre was hereditary among the Israelites, who followed in it the example of their forefather (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Chimham</span>. David remembered Barzillai's kindness to the last, and. on his dying bed specially commended Chimham and his brothers to the care of Solomon. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a> we read of "the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem," whence it has been supposed that David also endowed the sen of Barzillai with land near his own city. Stanley ('Jewish Church,' 2:201) considers that this was a caravanserai founded by Chimham for the hospitable lodging of travellers on their way to Egypt, and that Mary and Joseph found shelter there. It lay to the south of Bethlehem; but there is nothing more than the name to connect it with the son of Barzillai. In ver. 40 he is called in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Chimhan.</span>

But at the instigation of the high priests and of Amasa, who was actually in command, they determined upon David's restoration, and acted so promptly and so independently of the rest of Israel that, when they reached Gilgal, only the delegates of a few tribes were in time to join them. As we read in ver. 41 of "all the men of Israel," it is evident that the rest had rapidly followed. It would have been well if the tribe of Judah had informed the rest of their purpose, as the bringing of David back would then have been the act of all Israel; but tribal jealousies were the cause of Israel's weakness throughout the time of the judges, and broke out into open disunion upon the death of Solomon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away?</span> Why, that is, have they acted by stealth and without our concurrence? As they were discussing the matter, their decision should have been awaited, and David should not have crossed until formally invited so to do. The half of Israel consisted, probably, of the trans-Jordanic tribes, upon whom those on the  west of the river looked contemptuously, and of Shimei and his Benjamites, and a few more in the immediate neighbourhood. The trans-Jordanie tribes are probably those described in ver. 39 as "the people who went with David over Jordan;" for certainly a powerful body of the men who had defeated Absalom would escort David back to Jerusalem to overawe the malcontents and prevent any opposition to his return.

In <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31, 35</a>, again, we have ten tribes given to Jeroboam, and here, also, not only must Benjamin be counted, but be included in the tribes rent from the house of David. The tribe that had disappeared was that of Simeon, partly lost among the desert races south of the Negeb, and partly absorbed by Judah. Its position always made it unimportant, and no trace can be found of its taking any part in the political life of Israel. Some strangers from Simeon are mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> as coming to the great gathering of Judah and Benjamin at Jerusalem after Asa had defeated Zerah the Ethiopian; and Josiah carried out his reformation in Simeon as well as in Manasseh, Ephraim, and Naphtali (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). But it never seems to have emerged from a state of semi-barbarism, and no town can be found within its territories. We must, therefore, omit Simeon, and of course the Levites, who took no part in politics, and thus we have Judah standing alone, and all the rest determined to resist any attempt on its part to establish a hegemony, and restless even at having to endure the more ancient claims of Ephraim to be the leading tribe. By the ten parts which they claim in the king, they meant that, as king, he belonged equally to all, and not to his own tribe only. In this they were expressing a sound view of the royal position. The next words, literally, are, "And also in David I am more than thou;" to which the Septuagint adds, "And I am the firstborn rather than thou." This is in accordance with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, and states an important claim always made by Ephraim; whereas the Hebrew, "I in David am more than thou," is unintelligible. Except upon the score of numbers already stated, the right of each tribe in David was equal. <span class="cmt_word">Why then,</span> etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Why hast thou despised me?

Living as fugitives at Ziklag, in the land of the Philistines, David and his men, unfit for the peaceful occupations of agriculture, had been driven to seek their maintenance by raids upon the wild tribes in the desert. Of these the chief were the Amalekites, whose home was the bare region lying between the south of Judah and Egypt. We have ample proof that this race was utterly hostile to all order and quietness; it lived by the plunder of others, and, sheltering itself in the recesses of the wilderness, broke out thence on every opportunity to carry, ravage and ruin into all the neighbouring districts. The Amalekite was thus every man's enemy, and the object of universal dislike; and the cruelty which he habitually practised would justify to David's mind the barbarity with which he put to death all whom he found, man and woman alike. But his object was not justice. His cruelty was the result of selfish motives. For it was necessary for him to keep tidings of his real doings from the ears of Achish, who naturally would not approve of David's military activity. He very probably had put him there upon the borders to protect his realm from incursions; but David in the Amalekite war was the assailant, and was, moreover, practising his men for ulterior objects. Achish most probably received a share of the captured cattle; but his inquiries were met with an equivocation (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10-12</a>), which made him suppose that David, with the usual bitterness of a renegade, had been harrying his own tribesmen. And the falsehood soon entangled David in most painful consequences; for Achish, nothing doubting of his fidelity, and of his bitter hatred of Saul. determined to take him with him in the grand army of the Philistines, which was slowly moving northward for the conquest of the land of Israel. David had God's promise of ultimate safety, and he ought not to have deserted his country. As a deserter to the Philistines, he had to descend to falsehood, and now treason seemed inevitable. His only choice lay between betraying his country or the king who had given him so hospitable a refuge. The jealousy, or rather the good sense, of the Philistine lords (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4</a>) saved him from this dreadful alternative, and he was sent back, to his great joy, to Ziklag. But it was a dreadful sight which there met his view. With strange mismanagement, he had left no portion of his men to guard his little city, and the Amalekites had made reprisals. The news of the Philistine army upon its march upwards would be quickly carried through the desert, and the wild tribes would be sure to take the opportunity for gathering plunder far and wide. So undefended: was the whole country, that they met nowhere with resistance. And David saw, on his return, only the smoking ruins of the little city where for many months he had dwelt. His wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, the wives and children of his men, had all been carried away for the Egyptian slave market. So secure were the Amalekites, that they had no fear about encumbering their march with a vast multitude of children and cattle. And to add to his distress, his men, indignant, and not without reason, at David's want of precaution, were threatening to stone him as an alleviation for their distress. Never had David's fortunes fallen so low as at that moment; but quickly they were to rise again. By energetic action he not only recovered the spoil and the captives taken from Ziklag, but also won the immense wealth gathered by the Amalekites in a wide raid made at a time when there was  no one to resist them. His own share of the spoil was so large that he was able to send valuable presents of sheep, oxen, and camels to his friends in Judaea, probably not without some prescience that the way to his return might be opened by the events of the war between the Philistines and Saul. The dangerous issues of that war could not be hidden from him; but he would find solace for his anxieties in the active work of restoring order at Ziklag, and in providing hasty shelter for the women and children whom he had brought back to their desolated homes. But his suspense did not last long. <span class="cmt_word">For when David had abode two days in Ziklag,</span> news came which confirmed his worst fears. The battle had Been fought; Israel had been routed; and Saul and Jonathan, the friend who had been to him more than a brother, lay among the slain.

If we study the data, we find that David had marched with Achish as far as Aphek in the plain of Jezreel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>), opposite to which, on the rising ground near Gilboa, Saul had posted his army. A march of three days had brought him back to Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), and after the shortest possible delay he had started in pursuit of the Amalekites. The rapidity of his movements is proved by so large a proportion of his hardy men falling out of the ranks at the brook Besor; but nevertheless some time must have been lost at Ziklag in discovering the greatness of their disaster, in searching for any who might possibly have escaped, in getting food, and in mustering again together for the pursuit. Near the brook they seem to have found the Egyptian slave who became their guide, and who had been abandoned three days before David found him. It follows, therefore, that the Amalekites were then three days' march in advance, and however rapidly the pursuit was urged on, we cannot allow less than five days for it, and one for the battle (vers. 12, 13, 17). The march homeward would take a longer time, as David was now encumbered with flocks and herds, women and children. If it took eight days, the time occupied in it by the Amalekites, the whole period that had elapsed since David was sent away from Aphek by the Philistine lords would be eighteen or nineteen days; and it is thus evident that the Amalekites were plundering Ziklag at the very time when he was being dismissed, half angry, half rejoicing, at the slight put upon him, but little thinking of the sad need there was for his presence elsewhere. Now, the messenger from Gilboa, if an active runner, weald easily traverse in two days the distance which David and his men had travelled in three. And thus it follows that the battle at Gilboa was fought on the very day of David's happy return from the pursuit, and about nineteen days after the review at Aphek. If the word "tomorrow" in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a> seems to imply a more rapid march of events, we must remember that the meaning of the word in Hebrew is more indefinite than with us (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.</span> Though the Amalekite came out of the camp, yet we are not to suppose that he had been one of the combatants. Every army is followed by a vast number of vagabonds, intent upon gain, purchasing of the troops their booty, plundering wherever they have the chance, and carrying on a lucrative but illicit trade. He was more probably a sort of gipsy sutler than, as many suppose, the slave of some Israelite. He professes, however, to be upon Israel's side, and appears with the usual marks of sorrow. By so doing he hoped to commend himself to David, whom he knew to be too patriotic to rejoice at the defeat of his countrymen, though he doubted not that he would hear with joy of the death of so inveterate a personal enemy as Saul. On this account, and because the way would now stand open to David's ambition, he evidently felt sure of receiving a large guerdon for his news. There is, moreover, a further interest in his conduct; for it demonstrates the existence of a widespread popular feeling that David was destined to be Israel's king. It was this conviction which made him give David kingly honour; <span class="cmt_word">for he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span> And all Israel, on the morrow after the defeat, would probably have done the same, but for David's own conduct. Israel was too high-spirited a nation to take at once for a king a man who had marched with their enemies to fight against them, even though they knew that the voice of prophecy had appointed him to inherit Saul's throne. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-3.htm">2 Samuel 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And David said unto him, From whence comest thou?

But for an active young man the opportunity would then have come for booty. The Philistines, in pursuit of the enemy, would soon leave the battlefield in their rear, and multitudes would quickly prowl about it to plunder the dead. While so busied, the Amalekite falsely represents himself as having come by chance upon the wounded, but still living, Saul.

There, sore pressed and wounded by archers, hopeless of escape, and unable to make any further resistance, in sore distress at the death of his sons and the loss of the battle, Saul and his armour bearer fall upon their own swords. Here, closely pursued by chariots and horsemen, the king is so utterly deserted by all his body guard that he cells to a vagabond prowling about for booty to slay him. Naturally, Ewald and his followers, who regard the books of the Bible as mere patchwork, find here the marks of different narrators, whose stories the compiler of the Book of Samuel pieced together without having the shrewdness to observe that they were utterly irreconcilable. Some modern commentators have, however, attempted to harmonize them with little success. Really, the story of the Amalekite is a most improbable fiction, and utterly untrue. He knew nothing as to the manner of Saul's death, but found the body, probably some time after the king had fallen; and he was able to strip it because the pursuing Philistines were hurrying forward to make their victory complete, without being aware of what was the crowning glory of their success. As the pursuit advanced it would soon become safe for the Amalekite and others like him to try and secure some of the booty before the Philistines returned. Archers shooting from a distance might easily so distress Saul as to make him despair of escape - and it appears from the first narrative that they had not recognized him; for Saul is afraid lest they should do so, and, having taken him alive, should "abuse," or make a mock of him. Here chariots and horsemen are in close pursuit, and the king faces them grimly; nevertheless, they allow a stranger, who would not have dared to mix himself up with the battle, to rob them of their prize. We may feel sure that it was not until the tide of battle had moved onward in pursuit that the Amalekite ventured upon the field to rob the dead. When so occupied he came upon a corpse, now for some brief space dead, and at once recognized the tall form of the king, whose identity was made more plain by the golden circlet upon his helmet. At Once he saw the chance of larger gains, and hastily tearing off the royal crown and the bracelet from the fallen monarch, without a thought of rescuing the remains from the indignities which the Philistines were sure to inflict upon them, he hurried away with his tidings. Of course, he knew nothing of David's recent conduct, nor that for some time he had accompanied the invading army, nor that Ziklag had just experienced rough treatment from his own countrymen. Still, if he had told the truth, he would have fared well; for he brought news of great importance. But truth was not a virtue much practised in those days, and, fancying that the treatment he had met with from Saul would fill David's heart with bitter rancour against him, the Amalekite invented this story of his having slain the king with his own hands, in the expectation that it would win for him a double reward.

This word, which occurs only in this place, comes from a root signifying to entwine or knot together. On this account Jewish commentators explain it of cramp, which often follows upon loss of blood; but it is equally possible that it means vertigo, or giddiness, when things seem to dance or interweave themselves together before the eyes. The next words signify, <span class="cmt_word">For yet is my life whole within me,</span> and give the reason why Saul asked the Amalekite to slay him. The story is at least plausible. It represents the king as deserted by his army, even to the last man, and with the Philistine cavalry and chariots in close pursuit. He is not mortally wounded, but, as giddiness prevents his escape, there is danger of his falling alive into the enemy's hand; and as they would probably not have killed him, but carried him in triumph through their cities, the way would still have been blocked against David's succession. The fear of this indignity would account for Saul's earnest appeal to the Amalekite to slay him, and, so requested, it seemed right to put him to death, instead of trying to carry him off to a place of safety. But all this was merely to keep up appearances, and in his heart he doubted not that David would regard it as a signal service that his enemy was put out of the way.

But David had other reasons besides patriotism for sorrow. Personally he had lost the truest of friends, and even Saul had a place in his heart for he would contrast with his terrible death the early glories of his reign, when all Israel honoured him as its deliverer from the crushing yoke of foreign bondage, and when David was himself one of the most trusty of his captains. Otto von Gerlach compares David thus weeping over the fall of his implacable enemy with David's Son weeping over Jerusalem, the city whose inhabitants were his bitter foes, and who not only sought his death, but delivered him up to the Romans, to be scourged and spitefully intreated, and slain upon the cross.

And before pronouncing it David asks, "Whence art thou?" that is, he makes more full inquiry into his condition and previous doings. He knew that he was an Amalekite, and most probably had seen clearly enough that his whole story was false; but before deciding upon his fate, he desired fuller information as to the man's previous life. His question elicits from him that he was a subject of Saul. For the word "stranger" means a settler, who had withdrawn from his own country and joined himself to Israel. Moreover, it was the Amalekite's father who had done this, and probably he was one of many, who, finding their old nomad life too dangerous, had sought a home in the southern districts of Judah; but when the war broke out, the old instinct of these Bedaween made them follow the army for pilfer and trade in spoil. But as the son of a settler, the Amalekite owed by birth allegiance to Saul, and, should the occasion arise, was bound to render him loyal aid. Now, according to his own account, he had found Saul in no immediate danger of death, "for his life was still whole within him." Escape was at least possible with the Amalekite's aid, but he is eager to hill him. And David's question, "How wast thou not afraid...to destroy the Lord's anointed?" virtually means, "How wast thou not afraid to kill thy own king?" The Lord, that is, Jehovah, was no name of power to any outside the covenant people, nor in settling in Judea did the Amalekites accept the national religion. But the words would show even to a stranger that Saul was Israel's lawful and consecrated king. Commentators, with strange perverseness, have found in these words an outbreak of selfishness on David's part, and have supposed that he wished to guard his own person against future treason by making a wholesome example. But this is both to misunderstand the examination of the culprit summed up in vers. 13, 14, and also to put aside all account of the deep and agonizing sorrow which was rending David's heart. What would have been an Englishman's feelings if news had come that we had lost, for instance, the battle of Waterloo, and if the fugitive who brought the information had said that he had killed the wounded commander-in-chief? In David's case, besides deep distress at the disaster which had befallen his country, there was personal grief for the death of Jonathan and of Saul's other sons, who were David's brothers-in-law; and the words really prove his loyalty to Saul himself. He was still Jehovah's anointed, whatever his conduct might have been; and we have found David on previous occasions actuated by the same generous respect for duty when clearly it was contrary to his own interests (see, for instance, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>). David put the wretch justly to death for meanly murdering one whom he might possibly have saved. And the man's very purpose was to suggest to David, in a covert way, that escape really was possible, but that he had made all things sure, and so deserved a large reward. As a matter of fact, he had not killed Saul, but had invented the story because, judging David by his own immoral standard, he had supposed that he would regard the crime as a valuable service.

Thus Jeremiah wrote a <span class="accented">kinah</span> in memory of King Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>); and there is little doubt that the "lamentations" there spoken of were a collection of dirges, in which probably this ode written by David held an honoured place. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33, 34</a> we have a short <span class="accented">kinah</span> in Abner's honour, which possibly formed part of a longer poem, of which those two verses only are quoted as sufficing to prove, not only David's innocence, but also his indignation at Joab's foul deed. In both these places we have remains of David's secular poetry, and find it marked by the same strong emotion and the same sublimity of thought as distinguish his psalms. We observe also the nobleness of David's nature in his total silence concerning himself, and his generous eulogy, not of Jonathan only, but also of Saul. The mean envy and the implacable jealousy of the latter are no more remembered, and he sees in him, not the personal foe, but the brave king who has fallen in his country's cause.

He says that, as Israel's defeat at Gilboa was the presage of a long struggle, and as the Philistines had gained the victory there by their skill in archery, David used his utmost authority with his own tribe to get them to practise this art for their protection in future wars. This explanation would be plausible were it not that we have reason for believing that the Israelites were already skilful in the use both of the sling and the bow, in both of which the Benjamites especially excelled (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The modern view is that given in the Revised Version, where the inserted words are "the song of" the bow. "The Bow" is thus the name of the elegy, taken from the allusion to Jonathan's skill in the use of that weapon (ver. 22; comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-36.htm">1 Samuel 20:36</a>); and the meaning is that David made his own tribesmen, who were probably ill disposed to Saul and his family, learn this dirge, not so much for its preservation, as to make them give the fallen king due honour. Similarly <a href="../../par/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. is called "The Bush" in <a href="../../par/mark/12-26.htm">Mark 12:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The book of Jasher.</span> See on this book <a href="../../par/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>, where the Syriac Version calls it "The Book of Canticles," and understands by it a collection of national ballads commemorative of the brave deeds of Israelite heroes. Jasher literally means "upright," and the Book of Jasher would be equivalent to "Hero book," the Hebrews always looking to the moral rather than the physical prowess of their great men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beauty of Israel.</span> The word <span class="accented">zebi</span> means both "beauty" and also "the gazelle." Ewald takes it in the second sense, and explains it of Jonathan. "everywhere the first in courage, in activity, and speed; slender also and of well-made figure, and whose personal beauty and swiftness of foot in attack or retreat gained for him among the troops the name of 'the gazelle.' The Syriac Version also translates 'gazelle,'" but Ephrem says that the whole Israelite nation is meant, the flower of whoso manhood lay slaughtered on Mount Gilboa. Which signification we take must really depend upon the meaning we attach to the words, "thy high place;" and these in the Authorized Version have nothing to refer to, and so become unmeaning. The Revised Version follows the Vulgate in taking Israel as a vocative, sad renders, "Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places." The sense would thus be that given by Ephrem, Israel's glory being its "mighty" men or heroes, its warriors slain upon Mount Gilboa with their king. But ver. 25 makes it plain that the "high places" are Jonathan's, and not those of the nation; and the more correct rendering is "O beauty [or, 'gazelle'] of Israel, slain upon thy high places! how are the heroes fallen!" Thus Jonathan is certainly meant, and the heroes are the young, prince and his father; and as the hunted antelope is said to return to its lair in the mountains, and there await its death, "gazelle" is probably the right rendering. In a dirge in honour of Saul and Jonathan we may be pretty sure that Jonathan would be referred to in its opening words, and the camp name of his friend would bring back to David's mind many a brave feat wrought together, and many a pleasant hour of companionship in past years.

Probably, too, there was present in David's mind the remembrance of scenes which he had witnessed in these towns.

The sense would thus be, "Fields of corn such as was used for heave offerings." Still, this gives us no suitable meaning; for Gilboa was not a place fit for the growth of corn; and Theodoret, in his version, has preserved a different reading, which is probably right, namely, "Ye fields and mountains of death." <span class="cmt_word">The shield...is vilely east away.</span> This rendering contains a classical idea derived from the Greeks and Romans, among whom it was a disgrace for a soldier to return without his shield. But this imputes personal cowardice to Saul - a reproach which is entirely undeserved; for he did not east away his shield, but remained steadfast unto death. The right translation is, "For there the shield of heroes, yea, the shield of Saul, was defiled," stained, that is, with blood.

It was a Jewish custom to anoint the shield with oil before a battle (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>), in order probably to make the missiles of the enemy glance off from it without injury. And bearing this in mind, David now contrasts the sad issue of the battle with the hopes with which the warrior had in old times gone forth to war. Then his shield glistened brightly; now it was defiled with blood. In the Revised Version the rendering, "vilely cast away," is retained, the Revisers not having perceived that "defiled," which they have placed in the margin, is absolutely required for the text by the contrast with "the shield not anointed with oil."

When a nation is in the miserable plight described in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, there is neither safety nor comfort for the weak; but when the strong arm of Saul had won freedom for Israel, the women were the first to reap the benefit, and "their scarlet clothing with delights," that is, their delightful or delicate clothing of bright colours and their golden ornaments, prove that the nation had made a great advance in prosperity and culture during the happier years of Saul's reign.

It began just after the combat with Goliath, when the young prince, instead of seeing in David a rival, who had equalled his own feat of valour, took him to his heart, put upon him his own robe and armour, and thus presented him to the army as his friend and brother. Nor did his father's hatred of David, nor the knowledge that David was to inherit the kingdom, interfere with his love. He remained a dutiful son to his father, and accepted his inferior position with magnanimity, without once seeing in David cause for blame; and it surpassed the love of women, because, to requite their devotion, they look for protection and homage, the more delightful because it is paid by the strong to the weak. But here the lives of the two friends could not combine in one happy fusion of mutual union. Their hearts were bound together, but a hard fate, of which they were fully aware, made the ruin of the one the certain result of the happiness of the other. Nevertheless, Jonathan, with everything to lose, and David with everything to gain, remained true and loyal friends.

Glorious and noble in their pest lives, the heroes had now fallen, not as Wolfe fell at Quebec, with the shout of victory in his ears, but in the lost battle. And David seeks relief for his distress in dwelling upon the sad contrast between the splendid victories which Saul had won for Israel when first chosen to be king, and the terrible defeat by which life and kingdom had now been lost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_samuel/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Samuel 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm"><title>2 Samuel 20 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/20.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/20.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/20-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/19.htm" title="2 Samuel 19">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 20 <a href="../2_samuel/21.htm" title="2 Samuel 21">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a></div><div class="verse">And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name <i>was</i> Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There happened to be there a man of Belial.</span> The fierce words of the men of Judah led to evil results. It was a time when all wise and thoughtful persons would have laboured for peace, and tried to soothe and appease the angry passions fomented by the late war. Instead of this, the men of Judah irritated the Israelites with insult and contumely, and the day, intended as one of rejoicing and of the restoration of David to his throne by common consent, saw the rebellion break forth afresh. Among those who had taken part in the discussion with Judah was Sheba, a man of Belial, that is, a worthless fellow, but possibly possessed of rank and influence; for, according to many commentators, <span class="accented">ben-Bichri</span> does not mean <span class="cmt_word">the son of Bichri,</span> but "a descendant of Becher," the second son of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>), and possibly the representative of the mishpachah descended from him. But it is remarkable that this son of Benjamin disappears from the genealogies, and that no mishpachah of Bichrites is mentioned either in <a href="../../par/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a> or in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. In  both places Ashbel, who is enumerated as the third son in <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, takes the second place. We must be content, therefore, to leave this matter in uncertainty; but evidently Sheba had come with Shimei and Ziba to welcome David back, and, with the rest of the thousand Benjamites, had rushed with loud cries of welcome across the Jordan, and, but for this altercation, would have remained faithful. But tribal jealousies were always ready to break forth, and were a permanent source of weakness; and now, stung by some jibe at Benjamin, Sheba gave orders to a trumpeter to give the signal for the breaking up of the meeting, and, as is commonly the case in large and excited gatherings, the crowd obeyed the unauthorized dictation of one man. His words are contemptuous enough. David is no king, but a private person, and the son, not of a great chief, but of Jesse merely, a yeoman of Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tents.</span> "To his tent" meant "to his home" (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>). But this withdrawal home signified the rejection of David's government. Almost the same words are used in <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-2.htm">2 Samuel 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">So every man of Israel went up from after David, <i>and</i> followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So every man of Israel,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">so all the men of Israel went up from after David after Sheba.</span> They had come down to Jordan to bring the king back in triumph, but, on finding that the men of Judah had forestalled them, they had a quarrel, and as no one endeavoured to allay it and mediate between them, it ended in open revolt, and they transferred their allegiance to the worthless Sheba. Nothing could more clearly prove the want of cohesion among the tribes, and how little Saul and David had done to knit them together. We need not, therefore, seek for any deep reasons of state, or for proofs of failure in David's government, to account for the rapid success of Absalom's rebellion. Israel was a confused mass of discordant elements, kept in a state of repulsion by the sturdy independence of the tribes and their jealousy one of another. Even David's victories had failed to infuse into them any feeling of national unity, nor did the long glory of Solomon's reign and the magnificence of the temple succeed better. The kings were not as yet much more than the judges had been - leaders in war, but with little authority in times of peace. What is so extraordinary is that David had lost the allegiance of his own tribe; and it now, on returning to its duty, spoiled by its violence the whole matter. The day must have been a great disappointment to David. He was to have gone back conducted gloriously by all the tribes of Israel; but he had fancied that Judah was holding back, and grieving over Absalom. He had secret dealing therefore with it, in order that the day might not be marred by its absence. It came, but only to do mischief; and David went home with only its escort, and with all the rest in open rebellion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women <i>his</i> concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-4.htm">2 Samuel 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said the king to Amasa.</span> David thus takes the first step towards depriving Joab of the command (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>). This was a most unwise step, however guilty Joab may have been in slaying Absalom. With all his faults, Joab had always been faithful to David, and it was chiefly his skill in war and statesmanlike qualities which had raised the kingdom to a position of great power. Just now, too, he had crushed with smaller forces a rebellion in which Amasa had taken the lead. To cast him off and put Amasa in his place might please conspirators, and reconcile them to their defeat, but it would certainly offend all those who had been faithful to David in his troubles. Throughout David acts as one whose affections were stronger than his sense of duty, and his conduct goes far to justify Joab's complaint, "This day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-6.htm">2 Samuel 19:6</a>). If David, in the administration of his kingdom, acted with as little forethought as in the slight he cast-upon the ten tribes in negotiating with Judah to be the first to restore him, as it had been the first tribe to rebel, instead of waiting for the rest, and doing his best to make the day of his return one of general concord and good will; or with as little justice as in the matter of Ziba and Mephibosheth; or with as little tact and good sense as in substituting at the end of a revolt the rebel general for the brave soldier who had "saved his life, and the lives of his sons and of his daughters, and the lives of his wives and of his concubines" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5</a>); we cannot wonder that he had failed to secure the allegiance of a race so self-willed and stubborn as the Israelites. One cannot help half suspecting that Joab had used the power he had gained over the king by the part he had taken in the murder of Uriah tyrannically, and for cruel purposes, and that David groaned under the burden. But if so, it was his own sin that was finding him out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-5.htm">2 Samuel 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">So Amasa went to assemble <i>the men of</i> Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - He tarried longer than the set  time. But not longer than was to be expected. For the appointment was so surprising that everybody must have been agape with astonishment. They would naturally have expected that Amasa would he punished. Instead of this, he is commissioned to gather the militia in David's name. And men would hesitate about joining such a leader. Was he really loyal? or would he embark them in a new rebellion? And what would Joab do? He was not a man likely to bear such a slight tamely, and David ought to have foreseen that he was sowing for himself a crop of discord and enmity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than <i>did</i> Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David said to Abishai.</span> David thus gives the command to the younger brother, and we find in ver. 7 that even "Joab's men," his own special troop, were placed under Abishai's command. There seems always to have been a firm friendship between the brothers, and at first Joab acquiesces. The king was, in fact, in so grim a humour that he probably felt that he had better keep with his men, who would protect him, instead of remaining at Jerusalem, where he would be in David's power. When Amasa joined them, Abishai would have to resign to him the command; and David probably expected that, after a successful campaign, and with the aid of the men of Judah, who were rebels like himself, Amasa would be able to crush Joab. But Joab did not intend to wait for this; and immediately on meeting his rival he murders him, and assumes the command. <span class="cmt_word">Thy lord's servants.</span> These are the men enumerated in ver. 7, and formed David's usual military attendants. When war broke out, they were reinforced by a levy of the people. <span class="cmt_word">And escape us.</span> The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. It may signify, "and withdraw himself from our eyes," which gives the sense of the Authorized Version, and is supported by the Vulgate. The Septuagint renders, "and overshadow our eyes," which might have the same meaning, but, as others think, may signify, "and cause us anxiety." Many modern commentators render, "and pluck out our eye;" that is, do us painful damage. Either this or the Authorized Version gives a good sense, and, anyhow, rapid action was necessary, or Sheba's revolt might become dangerous.

Joab retained their command, and probably they would not have served under any other person. It is evident from the enumeration in this verse that the "men of Judah," after escorting David to Jerusalem, had all dispersed to their own homes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">When they <i>were</i> at the great stone which <i>is</i> in Gibeon, Amasa went before them.

And Joab's garment, etc.; more correctly, <span class="accented">and Joab was girded with his military coat as his garment, and over it was the strap of his sword in its sheath, and it</span> (masculine, equivalent to "the sheath") <span class="accented">came out, and it</span> (feminine, equivalent to "the sword") <span class="accented">fell.</span> This change of gender is very harsh, and has caused the Authorized Version to apply the masculine verb to Joab, and translate, and as he went forth it fell; but a very slight change, supported by the Septuagint, gives us a more satisfactory sense, namely, <span class="accented">and it</span> (<span class="accented">the sword</span>) <span class="accented">came out and fell.</span> It is generally assumed that all this was arranged beforehand on Joab's part, who had so placed his sword that he could shake it out of the sheath. More probably it was an accident, of which he took instant advantage. He had felt that his position was insecure, and that if David had the support of Amasa, and a powerful band of the men of Judah at Jerusalem, he would probably order his execution for slaying Absalom; and Amasa would carry out the command willingly enough, as he thereby would secure the high position offered him. We know David's feelings towards Joab from his dying command to Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-5.htm">1 Kings 2:5</a>), and probably he had given various indications of his deep seated resentment. Joab, therefore, determined to stop Amasa's growth in power, and also to give David a rough lesson. And this accident gave him an early opportunity, which he used with ruthless energy.

But holding down Amasa's head, he struck him with his left hand so fiercely that no second blow was necessary; and then continued his march forward as if what had occurred was a matter of little importance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-11.htm">2 Samuel 20:11</a></div><div class="verse">And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that <i>is</i> for David, <i>let him go</i> after Joab.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of Joab's men.</span> Joab left one of his personal followers to prevent any halt of the people round Amasa's body, and  to suggest that he was a traitor. For he was to say to them as they came up, not only that "whosoever had pleasure in Joab," but also that "all who were for David, were to go after Joab." All loyal men were to regard him as captain of the host, and to disobey him would be rebellion.

The Hebrew "stood" means "rose up to," "stood level with;" and the "trench" is what in modern fortifications is called "the glacis," and includes the outer wall of defence. The Revised Version renders, "it stood against the rampart." The usual way of capturing cities in ancient times was to cast up a bank or mound of earth against them (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>); and Joab's work had advanced so far as to be level with the outer line of defence. The name of the city in the Hebrew is not <span class="cmt_word">Abel of Beth-Maachah,</span> but <span class="accented">Abel-beth-Maachah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Battered</span>. This is a word taken from Roman warfare. The Hebrew says, "And all the people that were with Joab were destroying the wall to make it fall," most probably by undermining it. Ewald even asserts that this is the meaning of the verb, and translates, "were digging pits under the wall." The Revised Version adopts this for the margin, where it gives "undermined." The Septuagint and Chaldee have a different and probable reading, "And all Joab's people were devising (contriving) means to throw down the wall." This would be the next operation after the mound had been carried up to a level with it.

But of these words two completely distinct interpretations are given. The Jewish Targum records the one: "Remember now that which is written in the book of the Law, to ask a city concerning peace at the first. Hast thou done so, to ask of Abel if they will make peace?" The woman, that is, was referring to the command in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>, not to besiege a city until peace had been offered to the inhabitants on condition of their paying tribute. When a city was captured the lot of the inhabitants, as the woman declares in ver. 19, was utter destruction; and the Law mercifully gave them the chance of escaping such a fate. Joab had not complied with this enactment, but had assumed that the people would support Sheba, and was proceeding to the last extremity without consulting them. This interpretation gives an excellent sense, but cannot be wrung out of the present Hebrew text without violence. The other interpretation is that of the Authorized Version, that the woman was commending her words to Joab, by reminding him that Abel had been famed in early times for its wisdom, and had probably been the seat of an oracle in the old Canaanite times. When, therefore, people had carried their dispute to Abel, both sides were content to abide by the answer given them, and so the controversy was ended. Literally, these words mean, "they shall surely inquire at Abel," the verb being that specially used of inquiring of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am one of them that are</i> peaceable <i>and</i> faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am one of them that are,</span> etc. The Authorized Version translates in this way, because, while "I" is singular, "peaceable" and "faithful" are plural. Really  this construction shows that the woman speaks in the name of the city, and consequently the Authorized Version, while preserving the grammar, loses the sense. It should be translated, <span class="accented">we are peaceable, faithful people in Israel. <span class="cmt_word"></span>A city and a mother;</span> that is, a mother city, a metropolis, the chief town of that district.

Sheba had thrown himself into the city. and Joab, in hot pursuit, finding the gate closed - a measure of ordinary precaution upon the approach of a body of men - at once blockaded the town, and began to cast up the mount. At all events, they were ready to come to terms now, and would probably have given up Sheba at first, if Joab had demanded his surrender. <span class="cmt_word">A man of Mount Ephraim.</span> Sheba was a Benjamite, but the hills of Ephraim extended into the territory of Benjamin, and retained their name (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Over the wall;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">through the wall</span>, being the word rendered "at" a window in <a href="../../par/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8</a>.

This refers to Amasa's levies, who were glad to depart, and whom Joab did not want at Jerusalem. He took thither with him all those mentioned in ver. 7. Incensed as David must have been at the murder of Amasa following so quickly upon that of Absalom, yet that very act proved Joab's determination, and left the king powerless. He must have felt, too, that Joab was indispensable for the maintenance of peace and order in his dominions, and that he was at the least faithful to himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a></div><div class="verse">Now Joab <i>was</i> over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now Josh,</span> etc. With this list of his chief officers, the narrator closes the history of David's reign; for the remaining four chapters form a kind of appendix. A similar list closes ch. 8, where, too, there is a break in the history, the previous narra-tire having been a summary of the rapid rise of David's empire. In this section, ch. 9-20, we have a more full and detailed account of David's wars, leading on to his crime and its punishment. The rest of David's life we may trust was calm and uneventful, but it was the life of a sorrow stricken man; and the sword again woke up against his family when his end was approaching, and filled his dying hours with grief and trouble. This list is much later in date than that previously given, though most of the officers are the same. Cherethites. This is a correction of the Massorites to make the passage agree with <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. The K'tib has <span class="accented">cari</span>, a word which occurs in <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>, where in the Authorized Version it is translated "captains," but in the Revised Version <span class="accented">Carites</span>, which here appears only in the margin. But there is no reason why the place of the Cherethites should not have been taken by Carian mercenaries later on in David's reign, though really we know too little about such matters to be able to form a judgment. Some commentators translate <span class="accented">cari</span> "digger," and suppose that it means executioner; but why a digger should have such a meaning is inexplicable. It may be interesting to add that the Caftans were famous in old times as mercenaries. During the reign of Manasseh, Psammetichus won the throne of all Egypt by the aid of Caftans, and from that period they took a leading part in all Egyptian wars. The age of David is much more antique, but as there was constant communication between Phoenicia and Asia Minor and Greece, there is nothing improbable in David taking Caftans into his service in place of the Philistine Cherethites. His connection with them would soon cease after he left Ziklag.

For the Hebrew word <span class="accented">mas</span> does not mean "tribute," but "forced labour." This was one of the most oppressive exactions of old time, and it continued to be practised in Europe throughout the Middle Ages until it was abolished at the end of the eighteenth century by the French Revolution, except in Russia, where the serfs were freed from it by the late emperor Alexander II. Nevertheless, it was probably made almost necessary at first by the absence of money. As there was no money for the payment of taxes, the dues of the king or lord could only be rendered by personal service. Yet even so it was exceedingly liable to be abused, and the people might be taken from their own homes and fields just when their presence there was most needed. One most painful result was that the women had to endure, upon the farm and among the cattle, a drudgery to which they were unsuited. We gather from this passage that it was David who began this practice in Israel, exacting probably only from the descendants of the Canaanites (who, nevertheless, formed a considerable portion of the inhabitants of Palestine) forced labour employed in preparing for the building of the temple, and in the fortifications of his fenced cities. Under Solomon it seems to have been extended to other classes (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13, 14</a>; but see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-22</a>), and reduced to a system, which pressed so heavily upon the people  that it was the principal cause of the revolt of the ten tribes from Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Unless the Israelites had themselves suffered severely from this exaction, they would not have been driven into rebellion by sympathy with the remains of the native races. Subsequently we find Jeremiah accusing Jehoiakim of employing forced labour (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), but the severity with which he condemned it suggests that it had then ceased to be customary. <span class="accented">Adoram.</span> His appointment to this office was probably at a late period in David's reign, as he continued to hold the office under Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>, where he is called <span class="accented">Adoniram</span>), and even down to the beginning of Rehoboam's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>). We there read that he paid the penalty of his hateful office with his life. In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-18.htm">2 Chronicles 10:18</a> he is called <span class="accented">Hadoram.</span>

We there find David's sons holding this confidential office; but the feuds which resulted from David's sin had destroyed the concord of the family, and the usefulness of David's children. In their degradation from this office we see also a preparation for their being set aside from the succession, and the throne given to Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">ADDITIONAL NOTE</span>. With this chapter ends the second section of David's history; for, as we have already seen, the last four chapters are not arranged in chronological order, but form an appendix remarkable both for the singularly varied nature of its contents, and also for its omissions. The Second Book of Samuel is so thoroughly a history of David, that we should naturally have expected some account of his latter years, and of his manner of government after his return to power. But such details would have been interesting politically rather than spiritually, and the two narratives which have gone before are complete each in itself; and in each David is regarded from an entirely distinct point of view. In the first eight chapters we have the history of David as the theocratic king. As such he takes the heathen for his inheritance, and founds an empire. Even more remarkable are the alterations he makes in the worship of Jehovah. To the old Levitical sacrifices he added a far more spiritual service of psalms and minstrelsy, without which Judaism would have been unable to develop the evangelical realities which lay embedded in its ritual and legal ordinances. And it is important to notice that his service of sacred song is called "prophecy" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1-3</a>), from which we learn two things. The first that David's service was essentially the same as that established by Samuel at Ramah. There, too, we read of the company of the prophets prophesying (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>), their service undoubtedly being one of minstrelsy (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5, 10, 11</a>); and without Samuel's authority David would scarcely have ventured upon so great an innovation. Even so, this consecration of music by Samuel, and David's ordinance whereby there was established a daily service, morning and evening, of thanksgiving and praise (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23</a>.30; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-24.htm">Nehemiah 12:24</a>), is a most remarkable step forward; and by it the service of God ceased to be mere ritual, and became "a reasonable service" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>), such as was repeatedly commended by St. Paul to the members of the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, etc.). But secondly, it drew the minds of the people to the evangelic meaning of the Levitical ordinances. To this day hymns form a most important part of our solemn services, and seem especially adapted to draw out the inner and deeper meaning of rites and doctrines. They did not, indeed, begin with David. There are psalms older than his reign; but this consecration of them to the public daily service of God led to an outburst of Divine psalmody which raised the minds of the people above the material and grosset elements of their worship, and taught them the true nature of God, and made them ascribe to him high and spiritual attributes in wonderful contrast with the grovelling frivolities of heathenism. The Levitical worship was necessarily typical: in the psalms the people learned that God desireth not sacrifice, but the offering of a broken and contrite heart. Even prophecy, in its sense of speaking for God, would scarcely have reached the high eminence of future days but for the psalms. For only in a nation deeply imbued with poetry and song could an Isaiah have arisen, capable of giving in so perfect an outward form the mysteries of Christ's incarnation, his vicarious sacrifice, and universal kingdom. In the second section, neither the theocratic nor the prophetic element is in the forefront. It is the history of a fearful sin, and of its stern punishment. The sinner is the theocratic king: the punishment is the pollution of his house by incest and murder; the ruin of the glory of his realm, the rending asunder of his empire, begun in his days and consummated in those of his grandson; his own disgrace and flight; and his sorrowful return to his throne, impotent to avenge either the murder of his son or that of the man whom he had chosen in the hope that he would release  him from the stern grip of the ruthless Joab. The moral lessons of this sad story are beyond number. We see the saint changed into a sinner. No privileges save him from hateful crime; no repentance from draining the last dregs of the bitter cup of retribution. But never was the power of repentance in cleansing the heart and giving peace to the conscience more clearly shown; and the psalms written by David as a penitent, and during his flight from Absalom, are the most spiritual and choice and edifying of the whole Psalter. Without them the depths of self-abasement would have been left without inspired expression. The sinner in his greatest need, when crushed with the conviction of sin, when earnestly longing for forgiveness, when thirsting for the restored presence of God within his soul, and when feeling that, vile as he was, yet that he was not shut out from mercy, but that access to God's presence was still permitted him; - at all such times he would have gone to his Bible, and it would have been silent. These psalms are still the sinner's comfort, and give him the words which best express what is present in his heart. Without them the Jewish Church would never have reached that fervid purity of spiritual feeling which so animated the prophets; and even the Christian Church would possibly have stopped short of that full doctrine of repentance which she now holds. It is, indeed, the Christian's privilege to unite the doctrine of repentance with the thought of all that Christ has done and suffered for us, and so to understand why repentance avails to cleanse the heart; but even with this knowledge no Christian writer has ever reached so high a level of spirituality as David, though we may thankfully acknowledge that many of our best hymns do not fall far short of it. It is easy, then, to see that these two histories are not only of primary importance, but that no narrative after the time of the Exodus equals them in value. They form the very kernel of the Book of the Earlier Prophets, giving us, in the first, the true meaning and spiritual import of the settlement of Israel in Palestine; and setting before us, in the second, the nature of repentance, and so preparing the way for the revelation of the gospel of pardon and peace. They are followed by an appendix containing several narratives recorded apparently for their intrinsic value. Commentators have endeavoured to trace a connection between them, but their arguments are farfetched, and their conclusions unsatisfactory. It is better to regard them as separate and complete, each one in itself. They are six in number: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the visitation of famine because of Saul's cruelty to the Gibeonites; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some incidents in the war with the Philistines, illustrating the heroic character of David's worthies; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> David's psalm of deliverance; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> David's last words; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> a list of the Gibborim, with special records of acts of bravery and devotion; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> the visitation of pestilence because of David's numbering the people. The third and fourth sections especially are of the highest interest; while the second makes it plain that David's bravery in encountering the giant of Gath lit up an equally bright flame of patriotic heroism in the armies of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm"><title>2 Samuel 21 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/21.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/21.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/21-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/20.htm" title="2 Samuel 20">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 21 <a href="../2_samuel/22.htm" title="2 Samuel 22">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD.

It does not even follow, from the mention of Mephibosheth's name, that it must have happened at a time subsequent to the sending for that prince from Machir's house; for it may have been the search after the descendants of Saul which made David remember the son of his old friend. The burial, however, of the bones of Saul and Jonathan as an act of respect to the slaughtered king makes it probable that the narrative belongs to the early part of David's reign, as also does the apparent fact that the seven victims were all young and unmarried. Mephibosheth, we read, had a young son when David sent for him. Now, he was five years old when his father was slain (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), and thus at the end of David's reign of seven years and a half at Hebron, he would be twelve and a half years of age. The famine lasted three years, and if David had been king four or five years when the famine began, Mephibosheth, at the age of twenty, might well have a "young son" in a country where men marry early. We cannot believe that the famine occurred long after David had been king of all Israel, because manifestly it would have been unjust and even monstrous to punish a nation for the sins of a king who had long passed away. The sins of its rulers are visited upon a nation constantly through a long series of years, but it is always in the way of natural development. A statesman may put a nation upon a wrong track, and may involve it in serious difficulties, and even in irretrievable disaster, unless some one be raised up able to make it retrace its steps and regain the rightful direction. But this famine was a direct interference of Providence, and to justify it the sin must be still fresh in the national remembrance. Had it been an old crime long ago forgotten, instead of leading men to repentance, this long and terrible punishment would have hardened men's hearts, and made them regard the Deity as vindictive. It is even probable that the sin was still being committed; for though commenced and approved by Saul, his oppression and purpose of gradually destroying the native races was too much in accord with men's usual way of acting not to be continued, unless stopped by the justice of the ruler. We all know how the Red Indian, the Bushman, the Maori, and the Australian disappear before the advance of the white man. It needs only apathy on the part of the government, and rougher methods for clearing them off are practised than men would care to own. So with Gibeonites and Perizzites and other native races, a similar process would be going on. The lands they held, their little villages, their pastures, and above all their strongholds, would be coveted by the dominant race, and entrenchments would lead to quarrels, in which the natives would find any resistance on their part punished as rebellion. Even David seized the hill fortress of Jebus for his capital, though he still left Araunah the nominal title of king (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-23.htm">2 Samuel 24:23</a>). Saul had lent all the weight of the royal authority to the extermination of the natives, and this chapter records the Divine condemnation of wrong done by the dominantrace to the aborigines. It remains to this day the charter for their protection, and not only forbids their extinction, but requires that they shall be treated with fair and even justice, and their rights respected and maintained. It has been objected that the execution of Saul's seven sons was a political crime committed to render David's throne secure. If at all to his advantage, it was so only to a very slight extent. The sons of Rizpah could never have become pretenders to the throne; nor were the sons of Merab likely to be much more dangerous. In a few years they would have married, and formed other ties, and been merged in the general population. Mephibosheth was the heir of Saul, and David protected him and Micha his son. It was quite in the spirit of the times to visit upon Saul's house the sins of its chief. The principle was the same as when all Israel stoned Achan, his sons and his daughters, his oxen and his asses, his sheep and his tent, for brining iniquity upon the people (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>). We keep chiefly in view the doctrine of personal responsibility; in the Old Testament the other doctrine of the collective responsibility of a family, a city, a nation, was made the more prominent It was the Prophet Ezekiel who in ch. 18. stated clearly and with Divine force that  "the soul that sinneth it shall die;" but that the sinner's son, if he walk in God's statutes, shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live. But the collective responsibility enacted in the second commandment is still God's law. In the philosophic jargon of our times the two factors which form human character and decide our fortunes are "heredity and environment." Heredity was the prevailing sentiment in David's days; and it seemed right to the Gibeonites that the sons of the man who had slaughtered them should die for their father's sins; and it seemed just to David also. But he spared the heir to Saul's throne. There is no adequate reason for supposing that David was influenced by political motives, and the more important lesson of the narrative is the emphatic condemnation given in it of wrong and cruelty to aboriginal tribes. <span class="cmt_word">David inquired of the Lord;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">David sought the face of Jehovah.</span> The phrase is remarkable, and not found elsewhere in Samuel. Probably it means that he went to Gibeon to pray in the sanctuary, and consult God by Urim and Thummim. His bloody house. The Hebrew means "the house on which rested the guilt of murder."

Thus he had put to death wizards and all who dealt with familiar spirits (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-9.htm">1 Samuel 28:9</a>), in accordance with <a href="../../par/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>. In the same way he seems to have tried to exterminate the aboriginal inhabitants of Palestine, in accordance with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, and had especially massacred a large number of Gibeonites, in violation of the covenant made with them by Joshua and all Israel (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 15-27</a>). And as he would thus acquire "fields and vineyards" robbed from them to give to his captains, his conduct was probably popular, and the cause of a general system of wrong and oppression practised upon all the natives. It had thus become a national sin, and as such was punished by a national calamity. Amorites; that is highlanders, mountaineers.

As no distinction was drawn between murder and homicide, and as the nearest relative was bound in every case to revenge the blood shed, the custom of receiving a money compensation gradually grew up to prevent the tribe or nation being torn to pieces by interminable revenge. The Arabs still retain this usage, but it was forbidden by the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>), and rightly so, because a distinction was there made between murder and accidental bloodshed, and precautions taken for the rescue of one who had not acted with malice. <span class="cmt_word">Neither for us shalt thou kill any turn in Israel.</span> The singular is used at the beginning of their answer, in the same way as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-42.htm">2 Samuel 19:42, 43</a>.

We have noticed a very flagrant instance before in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a>. The object of these mistranslations is always the same, namely, to remove some verbal discrepancy in the Hebrew text. The Hebrew says here "five sons of Michal, whom she bare to Adriel;" but Michal never bore a child, therefore something must be substituted which will save the Hebrew from this verbal inaccuracy, and Michal must be represented as having taken Merab's place (perhaps at her death), and been foster mother to her children. This explanation is, it is true, taken from the Jewish Targum; but the Targum never professes to be an exact translation, and constantly perverts the meaning of the plainest passages for preconceived reasons. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-9.htm">2 Samuel 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell <i>all</i> seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first <i>days</i>, in the beginning of barley harvest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beginning of barley harvest.</span> The barley became ripe in April, about the time of the Passover (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>).

The word "upon" has led many commentators to suppose that she used it as a bed; but this is not the meaning of the Hebrew, though given by the Vulgate. The sackcloth was the loose wrapper or cloak which formed the outer dress of mourners. As regards the bodies of those crucified or impaled, the Law required that they should be taken down and buried that same evening (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). Here they remained exposed for six months, as a grim trophy of Gibeonite vengeance. <span class="cmt_word">Until water dropped upon them out of heaven;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">was poured upon them</span>; until copious and heavy rains came. The outpouring of these rains would put an end to the famine, and be regarded as a proof that the wrath of Heaven was appeased. There is no reason for supposing that these rains came before the usual period, in autumn, which was about the middle of October. Thus, for six months, with no other protection than her mantle of sackcloth hung against the rock, this noble woman watched the decaying bodies of her loved ones, until at last her devoted conduct touched David's heart, and their remains were honourably interred.

A new narrative begins here, and the heroic acts related in it are taken probably from some record of the martial deeds of David and his mighties. We have already seen that the Book of Jasher (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) was a national anthology, full of ballads and songs in praise of glorious exploits of Israel's worthies. The source of the narratives recorded here apparently was a history in prose, and commenced, perhaps, with David's own achievement in slaying Goliath - a deed which celled forth the heroism of the nation, and was emulated by other brave men. These extracts were probably given for their own sake, and are repeated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, where they are placed immediately after the capture of Rabbah; but they here form an appropriate introduction to the psalm of thanksgiving in ch. 22. It was usual in Hebrew, in making quotations, to leave them without any attempt at adapting them to their new place; and thus the "moreover" and "yet again," which referred to some previous narrative in the history, are left unchanged.

The Septuagint reads a "mace" instead of "new;" others think that he had a new suit of armour. If the narrator had thought it of sufficient importance to let us know that the article was new, he would scarcely have left the thing itself unspecified. It is evident, however, that the Septuagint did not read <span class="accented">hadasha</span>, "new," but the name of some strange warlike instrument, which being unknown to the scribes, they substituted for it a word which they did know, but which makes no sense. We cannot, however, depend upon the translation of the Septuagint, "mace." The want of special knowledge on the part of the translators of the Septuagint, though partly accounted for by the long absence from Palestine of its authors, and their having to depend entirely upon such knowledge of their language as survived at Alexandria, is more than we should have expected or can quite understand. Here, however, there is nothing remarkable in their not knowing the exact meaning of this carious weapon of the Rephaite; but plainly it could not be a mace, but must have been something that could be gift upon him. The Authorized Version, moreover, gives a look of probability to the insertion of "sword," which is wanting in the Hebrew; for it does not connect his purpose of killing David with the hadasha. The Hebrew is, "And Ishbo-benob, who was a Rephaite, and whose spear weighed three hundred shekels, and who was girt with an hadasha; and he thought to smite David."

The Jewish Targum had the same reading as that still found in the text, but regards Elhanan, "God is gracious," as another name for David, and, instead of Jair or Jaare, reads Jesse. Its translation is as follows: "And David the son of Jesse, the weaver of veils for the sanctuary, who was of Bethlehem, slew Goliath the Gittite." Possibly the Authorized Version is right in concluding that the present text is a corruption of that in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-5.htm">1 Chronicles 20:5</a>. For, first, the repetition of <span class="accented">oregim</span>, "weavers," is suspicious, the Hebrew being, not "weaver's beam," but the plural "weavers' beam," <span class="accented">menor oregim.</span> Next, <span class="accented">Jaare</span> is a transposition of the letters of Jair (in the Hebrew) made probably in order that the compound <span class="accented">Jaare-oregim</span> may obey the rules of Hebrew grammar. More important is it to notice that <span class="accented">Lahmi</span> is part of the word "Bethlehemite" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-hallahmi</span>), and might thus easily suggest to the eye of a scribe the completion of so well known a word.

The scribe who collected the Book of Psalms would be a priest, and he has repeated it with one or two additions, the most important of which is that the psalm was written "by David the servant of Jehovah." This title; meaning the minister or vicegerent of Jehovah, is one so high that it would certainly not have been given to David in his lifetime; nor was it even until Moses was dead that he was honoured with this rank (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>). But what was David's right to this title, which put him on a level with Moses? It was this: In adding to the sacrificial ritual enacted by Moses a daily service in the temple of sacred minstrelsy and songs, David was acting with higher powers than were ever exercised by any other person. For though, as we have seen, Samuel was the originator of these services in his schools, yet. there is a wide difference between private and public services; and David made his anthems part of the national liturgy. But it would only be when the halo of long use had gathered round his holy psalmody that David would be placed on in equality with Moses, and his authority a institute a new ritual for the nation be recognized. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-2.htm">2 Samuel 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, The LORD <i>is</i> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Jehovah is my Cliff and my Stronghold and my Deliverer:<br />The God of my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br />My Shield and the Horn of my salvation,<br />My Fastness and my Place of refuge:<br />My Saviour: thou savest me from violence.<br />I call upon Jehovah, the praised One,<br />And I am saved from my enemies."</span> The Syriac in ver. 2 inserts, "Fervently do I love thee, Jehovah my Strength;" but it probably only borrows the words from <a href="../../par/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>. For we may well believe that it was at a later period of his life, after deeper and more heart searching trials, that David thus felt his love to Jehovah only strengthened and made more necessary to him by the loss of his earthly happiness. In ver. 3, <span class="cmt_word">The God of my rock</span> is changed in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> into "My God my Rock" (Authorized Version, "strength") - probably an intentional alteration, as being far less rugged and startling than this bold metaphor of the Deity being his rock's God. In the original the words present each its distinct idea. Thus in ver. 2 the <span class="accented">rock</span> is a high cliff or precipice. It is the word <span class="accented">sela</span>, which gave its name to the crag city of Idumea. <span class="cmt_word">Fortress</span> really means a rock, difficult of access, and forming a secure retreat. It is entirely a natural formation, and not a building. In ver. 3 <span class="accented">rock</span> is a vast mountainous mass (<a href="../../par/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a>), and, as it suggests the ideas of grandeur and immovable might, it is often used for God's glory as being the Strength and Protection of his people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, margin). Next follow two ordinary metaphors, the <span class="accented">shield</span> for defence, and the horn for attack; after which David, who had so often sought safety among the cliffs and fastnesses of the mountains, returns to the same circle of thoughts, and calls God his <span class="cmt_word">High Tower,</span> the word signifying, not a building, but a height, a lofty natural stronghold; and finally <span class="accented">his Refuge</span>, a place of safe retreat among the mountains. This and the rest of the verse are omitted in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. In ver. 4 the words are as literally translated above, and signify, "Whenever call, I am saved." In all times of difficulty, prayer brings immediate deliverance.

But "cords of death" mean the fatal snares of the hunter, and are not in keeping with "torrents of wickedness." "Belial," literally, "worthlessness," is by many supposed, from the context to mean herd "destruction," that is, physical instead of moral wickedness. So in <a href="../../par/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> "a counsellor of Belial" means a ruinous, destructive counsellor. <span class="cmt_word">Sheol</span> is the world of the departed, and is equivalent to "death." <span class="cmt_word">Cried</span> is the same verb twice used. In <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a> it is altered, in the former part of the verse unto "I called" - a change probably suggested by the more fastidious taste of a later age. For temple we should translate <span class="accented">palace</span>, or <span class="accented">heavenly temple.</span> It is not the temple in Jerusalem, which was not yet built, but God's heavenly dwelling, that is meant. Instead of the terse ellipse, "And my cry in his ears," the full but heavy phrase, "My cry before him came into his ears," is substituted in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>.

But the poetic vigour of David's imagination intensities the imagery, and makes it more grand and startling. Not merely is there the earthquake and the volcano and the storm cloud, but the dim form of the Almighty is present, with the smoke of just anger at unrighteousness ascending from his nostrils, and the lightnings flashing forth to execute his wrath. But David certainly intended that these metaphors should remain ideal; and it was quite unnecessary for the Targum carefully to eliminate all such expressions as seem to give the Almighty bureau shape. In so doing it merely changes poetry into prose. But even more dull and commonplace is the explanation given by some modern commentators, that all that is meant is that David was once saved by a thunderstorm from some danger or other. Really this glorious imagery, taken from all that is grandest on earth, is intended to magnify to us the spiritual conception of God's justice coming forth to visit the earth and do right and equity. In ver. 8 for "the foundations of the heavens," we find in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a> "the foundations of the hills." The former is the grander metaphor, and signifies the mighty mountain ranges, like those of Lebanon, on which the skies seem to rest. <span class="cmt_word">The smoke</span> signifies hailstorms and, perhaps, also the rain driven in wreaths along the ground by the wind. <span class="cmt_word">Red hot cinders burned from him</span> describes the flashing lightnings that were shot forth like the coals from the refiner's furnace when heated to the full. It is to be regretted that the Revised Version retains the bathos of the old rendering, that God's fiery breath set coals on fire.

In this psalm the cherub is his chariot, on which he rides forth to judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He was seen.</span> There can be little doubt that the right reading is preserved in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, where we find a verb signifying the swooping down of a bird of prey upon its quarry (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>).

So the dark storm clouds are gathered round the Almighty to veil his awful form from sight as he goes forth for judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Gathering of waters;</span> probably the right reading, instead of which in the psalm we find "dark waters." The gathering of waters would describe the massing of the rain clouds. The difference here also consists only in one letter. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the brightness,</span> which closely surrounds the Deity in the midst of the black mass of the tempest, the lightning flashes forth. This brightness is the Shechinah (see above), to which St. Paul also refers where he says that God's dwelling is in "the unapproachable light" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>).

For while be acknowledges in them a tendency to sin, he affirms that he had been on his guard against it, and that he had ever kept God's statutes present before his view. However complete may be the penitent's recovery, yet can he never again be "perfect," the word applied to an animal without blemish, and therefore fit for sacrifice. The crime remains a blemish, even though the intense sorrow for the sin may make it the means of even attaining to a higher stage of spirituality and devotion. In ver. 22 the words literally are, "I have not sinned away from God," sin necessarily removing the sinner away from that nearness to God which is the privilege of the saint.

The general current of their lives is so ordered as to be in harmony with their characters. It is not by luck or good fortune that prosperity attends the righteous, nor is it by chance that things go awry with the fraudulent, but it is by the law of God's providence. <span class="cmt_word">Pious</span>. The Hebrew word means "pious" in the original sense of the word, which includes kindness to men as well as love to God. <span class="cmt_word">Perverse</span>. In the Authorized Version "unsavoury." Really it is the same word as that used in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, and signifies "thou wilt make thyself twisted," only the form is archaic, as is the case with some other words here. Experience confirms the psalmist's verdict. For constantly a strange perversity of fortune and an untowardness of events are the lot of those whose hearts are crooked. <span class="cmt_word">Afflicted</span>. The word in the original includes the idea of humility, and so leads naturally on to the thought of the abasement of the proud.

The lamp burning in the house is the proof of life and activity present there; and thus the extinguishing of the lamp means ruin and desolation (<a href="../../par/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>). So David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), because the active life of the nation centred in him. In a still higher sense the life and being of his people centres in God, and without him the soul is waste and void, like the universe before God said, "Let there be light." <span class="cmt_word">I run.</span> To the warrior in old time speed was as important as strength, and thus Homer constantly calls Achilles "fleet of foot." It was his fleetness which gave Asahel a high place among the mighties (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>), and to this quality David now refers. The <span class="cmt_word">troop</span> signifies a light armed band of marauders, whom with God's aid David could overtake, and stop in their course of rapine. The <span class="cmt_word">wall</span> means fortifications like those of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>). Sieges were tedious affairs in old time, but David had captured that city with a rapidity so great that the metaphor in the text is most appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Purified</span>; or, <span class="accented">refined.</span> This does not mean that it is proved by experience and found true, but that it is absolutely good and perfect like refined gold (see <a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>).

The phrase here is probably that which David wrote, as being less usual, and it signifies that God will direct the upright man in his good way. <span class="cmt_word">Hinds</span>.

The words in the Hebrew are very nearly alike, but the Septuagint notices the difference, and translates "hearing" in this place, but "chastisement" in the psalm. The Vulgate has "gentleness" or "mildness" here, and "discipline" in the psalm.

This exultation of David at the result of his wars is in accordance with the harsh treatment inflicted by him upon the vanquished. His enemies were God's enemies, whom he must consume. The "new commandment" of Christianity forbids and condemns this delight in conquest. Vers. 41-43. - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And mine enemies thou hast made to turn upon me their back,<br />Even those that hate me; and have utterly destroyed them.<br />They looked, but there was none to save,<br />Even to Jehovah, but he answered them not.<br />And I beat them small as the dust of the earth;<br />As the mire of the streets I stamped upon them, I trode them down."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Those that hate me.</span> The sentence is to be completed from the previous clause, "my  haters" and "my enemies" being equivalent.

He now feels that the watchful which had protected him during that dangerous period had a higher purpose than the union of the twelve tribes under one head. He was to be the founder also of that empire over the nations which symbolized the gift of the heathen world to Christ. And this empire had been extended to people previously unknown to David. Such might be the case with Hadarezer, King of Zobah, but it more especially referred to Toi, and the Hittite kingdom of Hamath (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>).

There is often almost an inspiration in the renderings of the Authorized Version. Grammatically, nevertheless, the psalm declares the blessedness of the king who is just, and may be translated as follows: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"He that ruleth over men righteously,<br />That ruleth in the fear of God -<br />And as the morning light shall he be,<br />when the sun riseth,<br />A morning without clouds;<br />Yea, as the tender grass from the earth,<br />from sunshine, from rain."</span> A king who rules his people justly is as glorious as the sun rising in its strength to drive away the works of darkness, and give men, by precept and example, the light of clear knowledge of their duty. But the last metaphor is especially beautiful. In the summer, vegetation dries up under the burning heat of the sun; all is bare and brown, and a few withered stalks of the coarser plants alone remain. But when the rains come, followed by bright sunshine, nature at one burst flashes into beauty, and the hillsides and plains are covered with the soft green of the reviving grass, through which myriads of flowers soon push their way, and clothe the landscape with bright colours. So a just and upright government calls into being countless forms of human activity, and fosters all that is morally beautiful, while it checks the blighting influences of unregulated passion and selfish greed.

Such catalogues might possibly be revised from time to time, and new names inserted as there were vacancies caused by death. And this seems to have been the case with the list in Chronicles, which contains the names of all who were admitted during David's reign into the order of the mighties. The present is the actual list of the order as it existed on the day when David, at Hebron, was anointed king over all the twelve tribes. And we can well conceive that, on so grand an occasion, David founded this, the first order of chivalry, and gave his thirty knights, as they would be now called, their special rank and high privileges. <span class="cmt_word">The Tachmonite.</span> This verse is extremely corrupt. A man could not be a Tachmonite and an Eznite at the same time. In the Revised Version the corruption is confessed in the mildest terms, but there is something painfully ludicrous in giving Josheb-basshebeth as the man's name. The reading "Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite," in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-6.htm">1 Chronicles 12:6</a>, where Jashobeam is mentioned among those who joined David at Ziklag, and by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>, where we find him appointed commander of the first brigade of twenty-four thousand men. The error in the present text arose from the scribe's eye being misled by catching sight of <span class="accented">basshebeth</span> in the line above, it being the word translated "in the same place" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">He Adino the Eznite.</span> These unmeaning words are a corruption of the right reading preserved in Chronicles, "he lifted up his spear." The number of men whom he slew at one time is there stated as having been three hundred; but, as Abishai accomplished this feat, and yet held only inferior rank, eight hundred is probably right. And possibly it is not meant that he slew them all with his own hand, though that is quite possible. He was <span class="cmt_word">chief of the captains.</span> The word for "captain," <span class="accented">shalish</span>, is derived from the numeral "three;" and probably it was the title of the three who formed the first rank of the mighties. But in course of time it seems to have been applied to the commanders of the body guard (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>); and we find Bidcar so styled when in personal attendance upon Jehu (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>); and Pekah used the opportunities afforded by this office for the murder of Pekahiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). It is not used of military officers generally. Those admitted to the list were evidently the outlaws . who had been with David in his wanderings and at Ziklag. They now received their reward, and became, moreover, the stay of David's throne. It is their past history which accounts for the strange composition of the list. A large number came from Judah, and especially from Bethlehem. Several are David's own relatives. Seven towns or families furnish sixteen out of the whole list. We find a father and his son, and pairs of brothers. There are, moreover, numerous foreigners - Hittites, Ammonites, Moabites, a Syrian from Zobah, and Gideonites, descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Such a list would have been sorely resented had it not been formed out of men who had earned it by their past services and their fidelity to David.

He would thus belong to the most warlike tribe of Israel, though not mentioned among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7</a>). He joined him, apparently, at an earlier date. That <span class="cmt_word">were there gathered together.</span> The word "there" implies the previous mention of some place, and though the text in the parallel passage in Chronicles is more corrupt than that before us, it has, nevertheless, preserved the name of the spot where the encounter took place. In Chronicles the name of Shammah is omitted, and his achievement is mixed up in a strange fashion with that of Eleazar. Here the two heroes have each his separate record, and it is only on minor matters that the text there is more correct. Restored from the readings in Chronicles, the narrative is as follows: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up: and he stood (that is, made a stand) and smote," etc. <span class="accented">Pas-dammim</span> is called <span class="accented">Ephes-dammim</span> in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. It was situated in the valley of Elah, and, as being upon the border, was the scene of numerous conflicts, whence its name, "the boundary of blood." It was there that David slew Goliath. <span class="cmt_word">Were gone away;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">went up</span>; that is, to battle. The idea that the Israelites had fled is taken from the parallel place in Chronicles, where, however, it refers to Shammah's exploit. In vers. 9 and 11 there, the phrase, "the Philistines were gathered together," occurs twice, and the scribe, having accidentally omitted the intervening words, has confused together the exploits of Eleazar and Shammah. In this battle Eleazar withstood the Philistine onset, and smote them till his hand clave to his sword hilt. Many such instances of cramp are recorded, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, in his commentary, quotes one in which the muscles of a warrior's hand could be relaxed, after hard fighting, only by fomentations of hot water. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-10.htm">2 Samuel 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Victory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">salvation</span>; and so also in ver. 12 and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Returned after him.</span> This does not imply that they had fled, but simply that they turned in whichever way he turned, and followed him.

The Revisers have retained in the margin, "or, for foraging:" but its occurrence in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a>, where it is tendered "thy congregation," and in the margin of the Revised Version," troop" makes it probable that" troop" is the right rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Lentiles</span>.

The absence of the article shows that these three were not Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah, but probably Abishai, Be-naiah, and another whose name and exploits have been purposely omitted both here and in Chronicles. Apparently this narrative, so interesting as showing the fascination which David exercised over his men, is given as having led to the institution of this second order of three in the brotherhood of the mighties. <span class="cmt_word">In the harvest time.</span> The Hebrew is "to harvest," but in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15</a> "to the rock." As the preposition used here cannot mean "in," this is probably the right reading. In this case, also, it is the similarity of the words that has led to the con. fusion. Is it possible that these lists were taken from very old and worn catalogues, which it was very difficult to decipher?

In its neighbourhood is an isolated hill, on which, probably, was a frontier fortress, in which David prepared to defend himself.

The cistern of "deep, clear, cool water," descsribed by Ritter, in his 'Geography of Palestine,' and now called David's Well, is three quarters of a mile to the north of Bethlehem, and too distant to be that which David meant.

The valley of Rephaim, in fact, extended from Jerusalem  to Bethlehem, and, to guard their position, the Philistines held Bethlehem with a strong garrison. Of course the heroes would use every precaution; for to be discovered would be certain death. The story of their perils and presence of mind in danger, and hairbreadth escape, would be full of interest; but we are told only that they succeeded, and returned in safety, bearing their precious burden; but David would not drink, <span class="cmt_word">and poured it out unto Jehovah.</span> The word is that used of a sacrificial libation; for David regarded it as holy, and consecrated to God, because it had been bought with blood - at the risk, that is, of the lives of these gallant men. Nothing is recorded in the romances of the Middle Ages, when knightly chivalry was at its height, more gallant and noble than the exploit of these men. And the very essence of its devotion lay in the fact that it was done to gratify a mere sick longing, and therefore out of pure love. Sick, no doubt, David was, and burning with fever; and even more depressed by the apparent hopelessness of his position. The exploit changed the course of his thoughts. What could he not do with such heroes! Though racked during their absence with anxiety and self-reproach, yet on their return he would be dispirited no longer, but filled with confidence. The words, "Shall I drink?" inserted in the Revised Version, have apparently dropped out of the text by accident. They are found in the parallel place in Chronicles, and in the Septuagint and Vulgate here. The Syriac has, "At the peril of their life's blood these men went."

Abishai, by reason of this exploit, became "chief of the three;" that is, of the second order of three established in the fraternity of the mighties. At the end of the verse, and in ver. 19, the Authorized Version strangely puts the article where it is absent in the Hebrew, and omits it where it is present. The right rendering and meaning is, "He had a name, that is, rank, reputation, among the three. Was he not the most honourable of the three? For this he was made their captain: yet he attained not to equal dignity with the first three."

The meaning of the description given of him there is disputed; but probably it should be translated, "Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the priest, as head," that is, of the brigade. He was thus the son of the Jehoiada who was leader of the house of Aaron, and whose coming to Hebron with three thousand seven hundred martial priests did so much to make David king of all Israel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>).

"Ariel" means "lion of God," and is a name given to Jerusalem in <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-1.htm">Isaiah 29:1, 2</a>. The Syriac supports the Authorized Version in understanding by the term "heroes," or "champions;" but the use of poetical language in a prosaic catalogue is so strange that the Septuagint is probably right. If so, Ariel is the proper name of the King of Moab and the achievement took place in the war recorded in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A lion.</span> This achievement would be as gratefully remembered as the killing of a man eating tiger by the natives in India. A lion, driven by the cold from the forests, had made its lair in a dry tank near some town, and thence preyed upon the inhabitants as they went in and out of the city. And Benaiah had pity upon them, and came to the rescue, and went down into the pit, and, at the risk of his life, slew the lion.

This arrangement of men in tens, with an officer over them. was, in fact, the normal rule among the Hebrews. The second triad is  unusual, but is explained by the history. In honour of the exploit of bringing the water from the well of Bethlehem, this second order of three was instituted, lower than the three chiefs, but higher than the rest. The third of these is not mentioned, and the disappearance of the name is not the result of accident, but of purpose. Had it been a scribe's error, there would have been some trace of it in the versions. But if the name was erased, it must have been blotted out for treason, and we thus have two candidates for the vacant niche: one is Amasa, and the other Ahithophel. The name of Joab we cannot for one moment admit. He never was a traitor to David, nor would the latter, though king, have ventured to degrade one so powerful, and who continued to be commander-in-chief until David's death. Now, if Amasa is the same as the Amasai in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>, who was chief of the captains who came from Judah and Benjamin to David when he was in the hold, it is difficult to account for the absence of his name from the list of the thirty. Plainly, however, David did not regard his treason with strong displeasure, but was prepared, after Absalom's death, to make him commander-in-chief. But we must remember that a place in this second triad was gained by one exploit. The three were those who broke through the Philistine host, and fetched the water from Bethlehem. Such a deed would account for the close attachment between David and Ahithophel. He was the king's companion, and his familiar friend. It would account also for his suicide. His love to David had, for some unknown reason, turned to bitter hatred. He sought, not only David's life, but his dishonour. His feelings must have been highly excited before he could have worked himself up to such a pitch; and the reaction and disappointment would be equally extreme. He never could have faced David again, remembering the warmth of former love, and the shamelessness with which he had sought, not only his life, but to bring upon him public shame and ignominy. And his name would have been totally erased, and gone down into silence. Of Ahithophel's personal accomplishments as a brave warrior, we cannot doubt (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>), and his son Eliam was one of the mighties.

And as Satan can act only so far as the Divine will permits, the temptation was most truly the doing of Jehovah (but see note on 1 Samuel 26:19). <span class="cmt_word">Captain of the host, which was with him.</span> There is a good deal of difficulty about this passage, as the word for "host" is not that elsewhere used, and the last phrase is somewhat meaningless. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a> we find "David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people." Without the concurrence of these rulers, who were the princes of the tribes, the census could not have been taken. But as the ancient versions confirm the reading of the Hebrew here, no change of the text is admissible. <span class="cmt_word">Number ye.</span> This is distinctly the war word, for which see note on 2 Samuel 18:1. It proves that the census was taken for military reasons. Even this in itself was not wrong (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-2.htm">Numbers 26:2</a>), but it is indicative of David's purpose. When, moreover, Moses numbered the people, the census was taken by the priests (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-1.htm">Numbers 26:1, 2</a>), and from the payment of the half shekel to the sanctuary, it appears that it was to some extent a religious ceremony. All this David neglects, and the employment of Joab goes far to prove that what David wanted was an examination of the military resources of his kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-3.htm">2 Samuel 24:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see <i>it</i>: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</span> Joab was an unscrupulous and irreligious man; but he was clear headed, and far more statesmanlike than David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5-7</a>). He saw whither the king was drifting, and that the increase of the royal power, resulting from successful war, would be fatal to the liberties of Israel. Probably, too, though he had consented to carry out Uriah's murder, yet he despised David for it. When he had murdered Abner to avenge Asahel, David had deprived him of his command, and he had to endure a long period of disgrace; and now David uses him to murder one altogether innocent. Joab, we may feel sure, noted the degradation of David's character, and drew the conclusion that he was not the man to be trusted at the head of a military despotism. Warned thus by what he saw, his mind reverted to the principles of the theocracy, and their truth and value became more clear to his understanding; and honourably he remonstrates with David for violating them.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a></div><div class="verse">And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that <i>lieth</i> in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Aroer</span>. There is some uncertainty as to the Aroer here meant. There is first a city of that name in the tribe of Gad facing Rabbah (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), and this is apparently the city meant; for it is said that "Joab and his men pitched in Aroer, on the south side of the city situated in the middle of the valley of Gad, and unto Jazer." Now, Jazer is also in Gad, about seven miles west of Rabbah, and as Rabbah is on the extreme east of the Israelite territory towards Ammon, it would be a very convenient spot from which to commence the numbering, But there is another Aroer on the Arnon, to the south of Reuben, and many commentators think that this Aroer must be meant, as otherwise the tribe of Reuben would seem to have been omitted. But this Aroer is regularly called "Aroer on the brink of the valley of Arnon" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9, 16</a>); or simply Aroer "in the valley of Arnon" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-12.htm">Deuteronomy 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>); and cannot possibly be "the city in the midst of the valley of Gad," nor can this Aroer be "toward Jazer." Really the difficulty is made by commentators whose idea of the method of the census is superficial. Joab, in commencing it, formed an encampment in the open country on the right-hand side, that is, on the south of Aroer in the tribe of Gad, as being central, with Reuben on the south, and Manasseh on the north. It was "toward Jazer," that is, it was on the Jazer side of Aroer, and not on the side opposite Rabbah. We, with our simpler way of describing the points of the compass, would merely say that Joab's camp was in the open pasture land southwest of Aroer. Joab probably selected this spot because, though on the eastern border, it was yet not too far from Jerusalem, was central, and because a brook from Jazer flowing eastward for some distance, and thence to the north past Rabbah, would supply his people with water; and from this camp he would direct the proceedings of those who were to take the census. And as probably there would be considerable opposition - for the people would see in an act which for four centuries had been in desuetude threats of heavier taxation, of heavier forced labour, and of longer service with the army - Joab would require the presence of a body of troops sufficiently powerful to overawe malcontents. And these would be of no use at Aroer on the Arnon, in the distant south, but must lie eneamped in some central position, whence detachments could rapidly be moved to any place where there was danger of resistance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they came to Gilead.</span> When the enumerators had finished their labours in Reuben and the region south of Aroer,  Joab moved his camp northwards, and pitched in Gilead, on the river Jabbek; and, having completed the counting in this part of the tribe of Gad, would next enter the wild regions of Manasseh. It is probable that the tribal princes and local officers actually numbered the people, and that Joab, with a powerful force, constrained them to obedience often against their will. It was possibly this danger of resistance which made David entrust the business to Joab, instead of employing the Levites. <span class="cmt_word">The land of Tahtim-hodshi</span>. Gesenius dismisses this name with the remark that it can scarcely be regarded as genuine. The versions give little help; but Thenius cleverly extracts from the LXX., "unto Bashan, which is Edrei." Others, by a slight change in the Hebrew, read, "the land of the Hittites," and suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the Hebrew word for "month," so that the whole might have been, "They came to the land of the Hittites in the (third) month." Others, again, suppose that Hodshi is a corruption of the name of the town Kadesh. But the versions would certainly have preserved anything so commonplace as this. When they make mistakes, it is almost invariably in proper names or unusual phrases. The emendation of Thenius is too ingenious to be accepted, but it gives the right sense, namely, that from Gilead and the tribe of Gad the numerators went northward through Bashan and the rest of the half tribe of Manasseh till they came to Dan, the town on the extreme northeast border, and the limit in that direction of the Israelite realm, as Beersheba was its limit on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Dan-jaan.</span> Nowhere else is Dan found with this addition, and the Syriac omits it even here. The Vulgate, and Septuagint (Codex Alex.) read <span class="accented">Dan-jaar</span> the woodland Dan. Possibly the names of two towns have been run into one, and the original reading was "unto Dan and Ijon" (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>). Ijon was on the direct road from Dan to Sidon. <span class="cmt_word">Zidon</span>. This was on the extreme northwestern boundary. It did not actually belong to David, but both it and Tyro had apparently placed themselves under his protection, and were bound to render some kind of military service.

But as they were bound to serve in the Israelite armies, they were included in the census, and possibly one of its rosin objects was to learn the number of fighting men of alien races dwelling in Israel. They seem to have been reckoned as belonging to the tribe in whose borders they dwelt. So Baanah and Rechab, the murderers of Ishbosheth, though Beerothites (and therefore Gibeonites, who again were Hivites), were counted to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2</a>). These Gentile communities were chiefly to be found in the north, for which reason it was called "the circuit (<span class="accented">Gelil</span>) of the nations" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>), and in later times from <span class="accented">Gelil</span> came the name Galilee. The Syriac adds "Jebusites," and we find Jerusalem occupied by a community of Jebusites living in independence in the very neighbourhood of the warlike tribe of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>). This numbering of the aborigines by David is referred to in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-17.htm">2 Chronicles 2:17</a>, where it is added that Solomon made a separate census of them, and found that there were in Israel no fewer than a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred of these aliens. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8</a></div><div class="verse">So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nine months and twenty days.</span> This long period seems excessive, if nothing more was intended than merely counting the heads of the people, especially as the census was left unfinished. But there might very probably be difficulties with the aliens dwelling in Israel; and it is still more probable that there was a complete examination of all the military resources of the land. The result showed a very different state of things from that described in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, and we can well understand the existence of much elation and war lust among the Israelites on the first flush of pride in their new empire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah <i>were</i> five hundred thousand men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men</span>. In Chronicles the numbers are, "of Israel eleven hundred thousand men, and of Judah four hundred and sixty-five thousand men." These discrepancies are a remarkable confirmation of the truth of what is said in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> that because of the outbreak of the Divine wrath, "the number was not put in the account of the Chronicles of King David." Neither the writer of the Books of Samuel nor of Chronicles had any official document to refer to; and as the numbers are lump sums, and derived probably from what was said by the enumerators, the more exact four hundred and sixty-five thousand men of the Chronicles might easily in round numbers be called a half million. The other is a much larger discrepancy, and no satisfactory explanation of it has been given. It  is, however, quite possible that the additional three hundred thousand men were made up of the thirty-eight thousand Levites, as numbered on a later occasion by David, of the Benjamites, and of the aborigines, who belonged to the northern part of the kingdom, and might be included among "all they of Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>). The numbers are further attacked on the ground of exaggeration. A million and a half of fighting men means a general population of six or seven millions. Now, Palestine at most does not contain more than eleven thousand square miles, and a population of six millions means five hundred and forty-five persons to every square mile, or one to every acre. The country was undoubtedly very fertile in ancient times, and the ruins of populous cities are found where now there is a waste. But there were vast forests and pasture lands and downs, where there were the means of subsistence for only a few. But we must remember that the enumerators went as far north as Tyre, and counted the inhabitants, therefore, of the seaboard between it and Sidon. Probably they also acted in the same way in the south, where the limits of Simeon were very uncertain. Besides this, there is a very remarkable undesigned coincidence. We read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>. that David had a force of two hundred and eighty-eight thousand men, who formed his regular army, and of whom twenty-four thousand were called up for training every month. But there are reasons for believing that David took for this purpose each fifth man of those of the military age (see Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 389); and thus the whole number of such men would be one million four hundred and forty thousand. This, as Mr. Sime has shown (ibid., p. 378), holds a middle place between the one million three hundred thousand of the Book of Samuel, and the one million five hundred and seventy thousand of Chronicles, and shows that these numbers are not to be rejected on the score of exaggeration.

It appears also that the displeasure of God was manifesting itself before David repented (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>). Some sign of this, either in public trouble, or in the brooding of the pestilential miasma over the land, brought home to David's mind the conviction of sin; and he at once humbled himself before God, for the vanity of mind which had engendered in him a wicked lust after martial glory and thirst for bloodshed. <span class="cmt_word">I have done very foolishly</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).

This is probably right as being in harmony with the rest. Three years of famine, three months of defeat, or three days of pestilence. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> famine, pestilence, and the sword are mentioned as three of God's four sore judgments. But a fourth judgment is there enumerated, namely, that of the increase of wild beasts, and Joshua the Stylite says that in Mesopotamia, as a result of the desolating war between the Romans and Persians, about A.D. , beasts of prey had become so numerous that they entered the villages and carried off the children from the streets, and were so bold and ferocious that even the men scarcely dared go about their labours in the fields (Jos.

There would thus be nothing to come between the soul and God, and prevent the chastisement from having its due effect upon the heart. A famine would indeed equally come from God, but would necessitate effort and exertion on man's part. In the pestilence he would wait patiently, nor look to anything but prayer for averting God's judgment. In <a href="../../par/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a> David refers to God's mercies, in much the same way as here, as being a motive to repentance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a></div><div class="verse">So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even to the time appointed.</span> This rendering, though very uncertain, is retained in the Revised Version. It would mean, of course, the end of the third day, as the pestilence was to last for that time. The objections to it are that there is no article in the Hebrew, so that literally it would be "unto a time appointed." Secondly, the pestilence did not continue unto the time appointed, but was mercifully stayed. And thirdly, these words are a literal translation, indeed, of the Vulgate, but a violation of its  meaning. For Jerome, who made the translation, says, "'tempus constitutum' means the hour when the evening sacrifice was offered" ('Tradd. Hebrews in Duos Libres Regum'). The versions all agree that the pestilence lasted only a few hours. Thus the Syriac translates, "From morning until the sixth hour," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> noon. So too the Septuagint, "From morning until the midday meal." The Vulgate adds on thrice hours, as the evening sacrifice was at the ninth hour; and this is the meaning of the Chaldee Paraphrase: "From the time the daily sacrifice was slain until it was burnt." As the word <span class="accented">moed</span> used here means both a time or place appointed for a meeting, and also the meeting itself, the right translation probably is, "From the morning even to the time of assembly," or, as we should say, "the hour of service." <span class="accented">Moed</span> was the regular word for the time of the temple service, derived from the old name of the tabernacle, which was called "the tent of <span class="accented">moed"</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>, etc.), rendered iu the Authorized Version, "the tabernacle of the congregation," and in the Revised Version, "the tent of meeting." The hour would thus be the ninth, or three o'clock in the afternoon. <span class="cmt_word">Seventy thousand men.</span> This is a vast number to fall victims of the pestilence in so short a time, as even the most dangerous forms of sickness take some days for their development. But similarly the army of Sennacherib was cut off in a night (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>); as were the firstborn in Egypt, whose visitation more nearly resembles the course of this pestilence; and the rapidity of the death blow, striking down so vast a multitude suddenly throughout all parts of the land, would be proof to every mind that the mortality was the Divine chastisement for national sin. It is possible, nevertheless, that the black death cloud, bringing with it the plague, may have been settling down upon the land previously, and have alarmed David, and brought him to repentance; and though no new cases occurred after the offering of his burnt offerings (ver. 25), yet it by no means follows that all cases of infection were miraculously cured. The malady may have run in them its normal course. It was Jerusalem that was saved from the blow, and, after the offering of the burnt offering, the pestilence smote down no more.

Threshing floors were constructed, whenever possible, on eminences, that the wind might drive the chaff and dust away. Araunah's was on the east of Jerusalem, outside the walls, upon Mount Moriah, and was the site on which the temple was built (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Araunah</span>. The name is so spelt seven times in vers. 20-24, for which reason the Massorites have substituted it for <span class="accented">Avarnah</span>, found in this verse in the Hebrew text, and for <span class="accented">Aranyah</span> in ver. 18. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> the name is spelt <span class="accented">Ornan</span>; in the Septuagint in all places, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, <span class="accented">Orna</span>, and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">Oron.</span> The name is, of course, a Jebusite word, and the variation arises from the narrators having written down the sound as it caught their ears. In this, as in many other particulars, it is clear that the chronicler derived his account from independent Sources. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a></div><div class="verse">And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have done wickedly;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">I have done perversely</span>, or crookedly.

But David, with that warmth of feeling which makes his character so noble, can see only his own fault. It is not a true repentance when the sinner looks for excuses, and apportions the blame between himself and others. To David the people seemed innocent, or, if at all to blame, he felt that it was he who had set them the example and led them on. The narrative in this place is much briefer than in Chronicles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go up.</span> David probably, on receiving God's message, had gone to the tent which he had pitched for the ark in Zion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), in order that he might pray there; and while on his way he saw the dark plague cloud coming as the messenger of God's wrath to smite Jerusalem. In an agony of grief, he poured out his prayer that Jerusalem might be spared, and God heard him, and sent Gad a second time to bid him offer sacrifice, that, by making an  atonement, he might stand between the dead and the living, as Aaron had done in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>) He is therefore to leave the tabernacle, and mount up to the summit on which Araunah's threshing floor was situated. We read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-28.htm">1 Chronicles 21:28-30</a> that David wished to go to Gibeon, where the Mosaic tabernacle and altar of burnt offering were, to inquire of God, but that he was afraid, as the angel of the pestilence was smiting outside the walls. This is mentioned as an excuse for his offering at an unconsecrated spot. But it also suggests that David's choice was a submission to a chastisement already at work.

The addition there of the story of Araunah's four sons hiding themselves is very lifelike and natural. For these remnants of the aborigines, though tolerated, yet held a very insecure position, as we have seen in the dealings of Saul with the Gibeonites; and the coming of the king with his retinue to the out of the way spot where Araunah was at work, no doubt filled them all with terror.

But the word is omitted in the Septuagint and Syriac, and is probably a mere repetition of the following word. The remark is made in order to point out Araunah's generosity; and to mark even more clearly how hearty and sincere he was in his offering, the narrator adds, in Araunah's own words, his prayer for God's acceptance of David and his offering.

There is a superficial, but no real discrepancy between these two narratives. David gave the fifty shekels for the immediate use of the place, and for the oxen and implements. He had no idea at the time of permanently occupying it, and probably the note in the LXX., interpolated by scribes from the margin into the text, is true, "And Solomon added to the altar afterwards, for it was small at the first." It was a small altar hurriedly put together for the purpose of offering one sacrifice; and fifty shekels would be full compensation. But the sacrifice had hallowed the spot, and, when finally it was selected as the site for the temple, David bought the whole area and all that Araunah possessed there. Fifty shekels of silver would be about &pound;9; six hundred shekels of gold would be about &pound;1500; so that there is no comparison between the two sums. But the precious metals were worth very much more in David's time than in ours, so that the smaller sum was adequate compensation for David's first acquisition, while the larger implies the purchase of an extensive and valuable estate. Substantially the fuller narrative in Chronicles agrees with this. David refuses to sacrifice of that which cost him nothing, and must therefore have at once paid for what he took. But When God accepted his offering, and answered him by fire from heaven, then David said, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel." And as the Chronicler has in view throughout the selection of the site for the temple, he naturally mentions its full cost. In the Book of Samuel this purpose is not expressly mentioned, and the narrative closes with the forgiveness of the sin both of David and his people. Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed. But this sudden smiting down of so large a host humbled both king and people, and their eagerness for war and their lust of empire ceased. ?

And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto Hebron.</span> As soon as David had assuaged his grief, his thoughts would naturally turn towards his country. Fuller news would reach him every day respecting the movements of the Philistines, who, after so decisive a victory, would quickly overrun all the central districts of Palestine, where the battle had been fought. And very bitter must David's feelings have been. Had he continued in Israel, he and his six hundred men would now have hastened to the rescue, and all the braver warriors of the land would have gathered round them. As it was, he was too entangled with the Philistines, and too much distrusted by the northern tribes, to be of much use. Still, we learn from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>, that brave men did continually swell the number of his followers. Detachments of the tribes of Gad and Manasseh, instead of joining Saul at Gilboa, went to David as he withdrew to Ziklag. And while he remained there a considerable body of men from Benjamin and Judah came to him under the command of Amasa, David's nephew. So numerous were they as to alarm David, who went out to meet them, fearing lest they had come to betray him; and glad was he to hear their answer, "Thine are we, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse." Thus even as it was, his forces daily grew more numerous; for "from day today there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22</a>). But there was no national acknowledgment. With his numbers thus continually increasing, David was encouraged to make some attempt for the deliverance of Israel; but his position was one of serious danger. Great was the risk, but he knew where to go for guidance, and determines, therefore, to put the matter into God's hand. He summons Abiathar with the ephod, and, in the presence of his captains, asks for permission to go up to some city of his own tribe. The answer is favourable, and Hebron is the city selected. It was a place of ancient sanctity, was well situated in the mountains of Judah for defence, and as the Philistines bad not yet invaded that region, but probably would soon try to ravage it, the people would be sure to welcome the presence of one who brought with him a powerful body of trained men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-2.htm">2 Samuel 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-3.htm">2 Samuel 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And his men that <i>were</i> with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span> Not only had David wives, whom he took with him to Hebron, but many of his warriors were married, and thus they and their households formed a numerous body of people, for whom Hebron could scarcely find accommodation. Moreover they had flocks and herds captured from the Amalekites, for which they needed pasturage. And therefore David dispersed them in the towns and villages of which Hebron was the capital, posting them in such a manner as to render it easy for him to summon them together, while taking care that they did not injure his tribesmen, or dispossess them of their lauds. We may feel sure that he consulted the chief men of Hebron as to these arrangements, and obtained their approval. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, <i>That</i> the men of Jabeshgilead <i>were they</i> that buried Saul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David.</span> Samuel's anointing (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) had been private, and, if we may judge by the manner in which Eliab treated David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>), even his own family had not attached much importance to it. It was nevertheless the indication of Jehovah's purpose, and now the anointing of David by the elders of Judah was the first step towards its accomplishment. And this was an independent act, though the knowledge of Samuel's anointing had prepared the way for it; and David thus acquired a legal right and authority by the nation's will, which Samuel could not have given him. So Saul's anointing by Samuel, and his election to be king at Gilgal, were independent acts; and while the former gave the king his sacredness, the latter conferred upon him jurisdiction and power. <span class="cmt_word">King over the house of Judah.</span> How came the Philistines to allow this? When subsequently he was again anointed, and became King of all Israel, the Philistines gathered their hosts at once; not because he captured Jerusalem, which was then a mere hill fort belonging to the Jebusites, but evidently because they thought him dangerous. But why did they not crush him now? One reason, probably, was that Judaea was a difficult country for military operations. The tribe, too, had stood aloof from Saul, and its strength was unbroken. But the chief reason apparently  was that David maintained friendly relations with Achish, and paid him tribute. This explains the curious fact that Ziklag continued to be the private property of the house of David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). The doings of a vassal of the King of Gath were regarded as of little importance. Had he not even marched with them to Aphek, as one of the servants of Achish? But when he endeavoured to restore the kingdom of Saul, they first made a hasty rush upon him, and, when repelled, they gathered their forces for as formidable an invasion as that which had ended in their victory at Gilboa. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed <i>be</i> ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, <i>even</i> unto Saul, and have buried him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-Gilead.</span> This was David's first act as king, and it was worthy of him. Some suppose that when David was told of their deed, it was with a view of prejudicing him against them. But this is not credible. By this time all men knew how loyal and affectionate were David's feelings towards his former king; and moreover the men of Jabesh were bound to Saul by no ordinary ties of gratitude (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>.). Nor could David wish that Saul's remains, and those of Jonathan, should be subject to indignity. We may well feel sure that information respecting Saul was eagerly welcomed at Hebron, and the valiant men there would all rejoice at finding that the high spirit of the nation was not quenched. But in sending to thank them, in premising to requite them, and in bidding them persevere in similar conduct, David was acting as the head of the nation; and, to justify his action, he informs them that the men of Judah had made him their king.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner</span>. This hero had been present at the battle of Gilboa, and probably had rallied many of the defeated Israelites, and made as much resistance as was possible to the onward march of the Philistines. And as soon as he had effected his retreat into the region beyond the Jordan, his power would be supreme. There was no one there to oppose the commander-in-chief of what remained of Saul's army. Certainly all that remained of Saul's body guard of three thousand men would gather round Abner, and as the Philistines did not push their pursuit further than the Jordan, he was free to do as he chose. Nor would there be any opposition. Abner was bound to do his best for Saul's family, and the people would feel this, and approve of his conduct in standing up for the children of their king. Moreover, David by his conduct had made himself an object of suspicion to all the valiant men who had formed Saul's army, and these would be the more embittered against him by their defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth</span>. This name signifies "man of shame," that is, "man of the shameful thing," the idol. Originally he was named Eshbaal (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>), that is "man of Baal," the word <span class="accented">esh</span> being merely a dialectic variation for <span class="accented">ish</span>, equivalent to "man." At this early date Baal was not the specific name of any idol, but simply meant "lord," "master," "husband." In the earlier books of the Bible we find the word used of many local deities, who were lords of this or that, but had nothing in common with the Phoenician Baal, whose worship Ahab attempted to introduce into Israel. From that time Baal became a term of reproach, and Bosheth, "the shame," was substituted for it in the old names of which it had formed part. Thus Gideon is still called Jerubbaal in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, but the title is transformed into Jerubbesheth, or more correctly, Jerubbosheth, "let the shame plead," in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>. Originally, therefore, the name Ishbaal had no discreditable meaning, but signified, "man of the Lord," or, as Ewald supposes, "lordly man." It was not till long afterwards, when Israel had been horrified by Jezebel's doings, that Baal, except in the sense of "husband," became an ill-omened word. Jonathan, whose own name, "Jehovah's gift," in Greek Theodore, is proof sufficient that Saul's family were worshippers of the true God, called his son's name Meribbaal, "the Lord's strife" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>). In some strange way this was altered into Mephibosheth, that is, "from the face of the shameful thing" (ch. 2 Samuel 4:4. etc.). Possibly it is a corruption of Meribbosheth, but it is remarkable that a son of Saul by his concubine Rizpah also bore the name (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). Among the ancestors of Saul, the simple name Baal, "Lord," occurs (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span>. Abner chose this town because it was on the eastern side of the Jordan, and so beyond the range of the Philistines, who never seem to have crossed the river. It was situated on the borders of the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from both of which valiant warriors had joined David; but the people generally were not ill affected to the house of Saul. As having been assigned to the Levites (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), it had a quasi-religious character, inherited from the vision of angels seen there by Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). As a safe, out of the way place, David subsequently took refuge there (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>). (On its exact site, see Conder's 'Heth and Moab,' pp. 177-181.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make him king over.</span> A different preposition is used with the first three names from that employed afterwards, as though Ishbosheth's reign over Gilead and Jezreel was a reality, but that he had only a shadowy claim to dominion over Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel. Gilead. As  Mahanaim lay upon the borders of Gad and Manasseh, Abner would easily control these two tribes, and Reuben, which was never an active or enterprising tribe, would follow their lead. Of the <span class="cmt_word">Ashurites</span> nothing is known, and the reading is uncertain, as the LXX. has "Thasir," and the Vulgate and Syriac "Geshur." The Chaldee paraphrase boldly gives "the house of Asher;" but this tribe lay close to Phoenicia, on the extreme northwest. There are two places called Geshur (see on 2 Samuel 3:3), but neither of them seems meant, and more probably it was some place the name of which was uncommon, and so was wrongly copied by scribes until the present confusion arose. Jezreel. The name of this place, as specially subject to Ishbosheth, is surprising; for the town, at this time of no importance, lay in the wide plain between the mountains of Gilboa and the little Hermon. But this district was the prize won by the Philistines, and was a region where their cavalry and chariots gave them a great advantage. For Ishbosheth to have had even a nominal dominion over Jezreel, he must either have become a tributary, or Abner must have maintained a not unsuccessful struggle there after the battle of Gilboa. The latter is the more probable. In safe possession of all the country east of the Jordan, Abner was not likely to consent to anything so humiliating as submission to the Philistines; while David's connection with Achish made it neither so galling to him nor so disadvantageous. As the Transjordanic tribes assembled at Hebron to make David king to the number of one hundred and twenty thousand men (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-37.htm">1 Chronicles 12:37</a>), Abner plainly had large resources at his command, and, though the people were not very earnest in the cause of Saul's house, yet they would probably assemble in considerable numbers after the battle of Gilboa, to prevent any irruption of the victors into their country. At their head Abner probably gained some advantages over the Philistines, and thus became powerful enough to proclaim Ishbosheth king, and as Ephraim and Benjamin acquiesced, he became nominally ruler over all Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">Ishbosheth Saul's son <i>was</i> forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth...two years ... David... seven years and six months</span>. Where are we to place the five years and a half of difference? The usual assumption is that David was made King of Israel immediately upon Ishbosheth's murder; but this is wrong. We cannot believe that Abner would allow so long a period as five years to elapse before asserting the claims of Saul's family, especially as David was already made King of Judah at Hebron. Still, as the war with the Philistines was the first object of his care, and as some form of popular ratification was necessary, some months may have passed before Ishbosheth was publicly installed as king, though Abner must have acted in his name from the first. The main interval of five years before David's accession must have been after Ishbosheth's death. That murder, and still more so the murder of Abner, must have made David an object of great suspicion to all Israel. Shimei, when he called him "a bloody man" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), was but uttering a slander commonly current among the people. Gradually most of them would become convinced of his innocence; and all, as they contrasted the anarchy which prevailed in their country with the peace and security won by David for Judah, would regard his election as the best course under the circumstances. As the Philistines immediately resented their action, and endeavoured to crush the king before he could concentrate his power, it is probable that during these five years they had again obtained practical command of the more fertile districts of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth... was forty years old.</span> In the previous narrative Jonathan always appears as the most important of Saul's sons, and naturally it is assumed that he was the firstborn; yet his child was but five years old at his father's death, while Ishbosheth, his uncle, a younger brother of Jonathan, is described as a man of forty. Some think that Ishbosheth was the eldest son, but in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> he is placed last, and, though a weak man, was not so feeble as to have been set aside from the succession. But confessedly the chronology of Saul's reign is so full of difficulties, that it is impossible altogether to explain it (see note on 1 Samuel 13:1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner...  went out.</span> This is a further proof of considerable success on Abner's side. Encouraged by the result of numerous skirmishes with the Philistines, and the gradual restoration of the king's authority in Ephraim and Benjamin, Abner determined to make the attempt to win back Judah also. There David had been content with protecting Judah, and establishing good order; and, following his constant custom, had taken no steps to obtain for himself the kingdom "over all Israel." The war was of Abner's choosing, and shows him to us in the character of an able but ambitious and restless man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The pool of Gibson.</span> As Gibeon, which lay about six miles northwest from Jerusalem, was twenty-six miles distant from Hebron, and about the same distance from Mahauaim, it is plain that David knew of Abner's march. Possibly he had been summoned to yield his kingdom up to Ishbosheth as the rightful lord, but, while taking no measures to extend his rule, he felt himself  justified in defending his election to be king ever Judah. <span class="accented">The pool of Gibeon</span> is described by Robinson ('Researches,' 2:136) as "an open tank about a hundred and twenty feet in length and a hundred in breadth, surrounded by a grove of olive trees. Above it, excavated in the rock, is a subterranean reservoir, to receive the water from a copious spring, from which the overflow descends into the tank below." As neither party was willing to shed the first blood in a civil war, of which the Philistines would reap the benefit, they both halted in sight of one another on opposite sides of the hill, with the tank below them in the middle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let the young men now arise.</span> "Now" is not an adverb of time, but is hortative, and therefore rightly translated in the Revised Version, "I pray thee." It is by no means certain that Abner meant that this single combat should decide the war; for similar preludes before a battle are not uncommon among the Arabians, and serve, as this did, to put an end to the mutual unwillingness to begin the onslaught. So, too, games often preceded outbreaks of Scandinavian blood feuds. And this was probably Abner's object. He was the assailant, but now found that his men shrank from mortal combat with their brethren. There is thus no comparison between this combat and that of the Curiatii and Horatii described in Livy, 1. 10:25. <span class="cmt_word">Let them play.</span> The word is grim enough, though intended to gloss over the cruel reality. On each side twelve of the most skilful champions were to be selected, who were to fight in stern earnest with one another, while the rest gazed upon the fierce spectacle. The sight of the conflict would whet their appetite for blood, and their reluctance would give place to thirst for revenge. The request was too thoroughly in accordance with Joab's temper for him to refuse, and his immediate answer was, <span class="cmt_word">Let them arise.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-15.htm">2 Samuel 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which <i>pertained</i> to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</div><div class="comm">

But what an action! Twenty-four experienced men each take the other by the head, and, without any attempt at self-defence, thrust their swords into their opponents' side, and leave their own sides exposed to a similar thrust. Were they, then, unskilful in the use of weapons? Impossible. Were they blinded by hatred of one another? But no rancour would make a man forget his skill in defence. Here there is no variety, no checkered fortune of the combatants, but all twenty-four do and suffer just the same; and it is remarkable that they had swords only, and no shields. With shields on their arms, they could not have seized one another by the hair. It seems certain, therefore, that this mutual butchery was the "play;" nor can we conceive of a more murderous and savage proceeding. Abner, at the head of his fierce Benjamites, thought, perhaps, that Joab had no men among his followers willing to throw life away in so senseless a manner. But Joab was as ready as Abner, and possibly some code of false honour, such as used to make men practise duelling, required the acceptance of the challenge. And so, with their appetite for blood whetted by the sight of twenty-four murders, they hastened to begin the fight. <span class="cmt_word">Helkath-hazzurim.</span> Literally this means "the field of flints;" but as the flint is constantly used for any hard rock (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-20.htm">Psalm 78:20</a>), the Authorized Version has admitted into the margin a paraphrase taken from the Vulgate, which supposes that by flints are meant "strong men," and renders, "the field of strong men." So in <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-4.htm">Isaiah 26:4</a> "the flint," or rock, "of ages," is even translated "everlasting strength." Flints, however, were constantly used by the Israelites for knives whenever extreme sharpness was required. Thus for the circumcising of Israel, Jehovah commanded Joshua to prepare knives of flint (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>); and in course of time the sharp or whetted edge of a weapon was called its flint. Thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/89-43.htm">Psalm 89:43</a> we read, "Thou hast turned back the flint of his sword." The name therefore probably means "the field of the sharp knives" (see margin of the Revised Version), and refers to the short swords with which they murdered one another.

Excited by the spectacle of merciless slaughter, the armies manoeuvred no longer, but rushed fiercely to the attack, and fought with fury. But the mighty men of David were irresistible. Only nineteen of his warriors fell, while Abner lost three hundred and sixty, and was forced to flee.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Asahel pursued after Abner.</span> This episode is fully narrated, both because of Asahel's rank as David's nephew, and also because of its tragical consequences to Abner himself. Asahel was a son of Zeruiah, David's sister, and, while his own brothers were of little use to him, his nephews, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, were the mainstays of David's throne. As their father's name is never mentioned, but only the mother's, Zeruiah was probably a woman of great ability, and her sons inherited it from her. Possibly she had married beneath her station, or her husband had died early; but certainly her sons, thinking more of her than of their father, had soon thrown in their lot with David her brother (but see note on ver. 32). The youngest of the  three, Asahel, was remarkable for his personal accomplishments, and especially for swiftness of foot, for which he was compared to the Zebi, the camp name of Jonathan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>). It now caused his death. For conscious that Abner was the sole support of Ishbosheth's party, and indignant at his challenge to useless slaughter, he pursued after him, allowing nothing to divert him from his object, and hoping to end the war by slaying the veteran commander. But though he had the fleetness of an Achilles, he had not his robust strength, and Abner, knowing that the combat was unequal, remonstrated with him, and bade him turn aside, and be content with winning the spoils of some meaner warrior. It is evident from this that Abner saw in this defeat in a battle of his own choosing, the certainty of the near downfall of the house of Saul, and, as he would then be in Joab's power, he was unwilling to have a blood feud with a man of such determined character. "How," he asks, "should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?" It would be his duty, as the avenger of blood, to slay me. Apparently, during this conference, he was standing with the butt end of his lance held towards Asahel, to ward off his blows, but, as the spearhead was turned the other way, Asahel forgot that even so it might be used for offence. For it was pointed, that it might be stuck in the ground at night (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7</a>), and possibly shod with iron, though it is more likely that it was only hardened by being thrust into the fire. So when he saw that his words had no avail, and that Asahel was not on his guard, he suddenly struck him with it so violent a blow that it pierced his body right through, and Asahel fell down dead. It is probable, from the merciless force used, that there was a sudden outburst of anger on Abner's part. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-20.htm">2 Samuel 2:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then Abner looked behind him, and said, <i>Art</i> thou Asahel? And he answered, I <i>am</i>.</div><div class="comm">

This rendering here and in other places arises from the derivation of the word from the numeral <span class="accented">five</span>, but this notion has long been abandoned, and the word is now known to be formed from a verb signifying "to be fat or stout." Really it means the abdomen, and is so translated in the LXX. and Vulgate, while the Syriac gives only the general sense, and renders "the breast." <span class="cmt_word">In the same place;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">under him</span>; that is, immediately. So violent was the blow that Asahel dropped down dead without a struggle. So tragic was his fate, and so great the affection of David's men for the young warrior, that the pursuit ceased, and all, as they came up, remained standing by the side of the corpse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a></div><div class="verse">Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that <i>lieth</i> before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Josh also and Abishai pursued after Abner;</span> really, <span class="accented">but Joab and Abishai pursued</span>, and so the Revised Version. The sight of their slaughtered brother made them only the more determined in the pursuit, and doubtless, at their command, the soldiers would leave Asahel and follow their commanders. Of the "hill of Ammah" and Giah we know nothing; but it is evident that no halt was made until sunset. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-25.htm">2 Samuel 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Benjamin...  became one troop.</span> Benjamin was probably the only tribe that entered keenly into Ishbosheth's cause; for the maintenance of the kingdom in the family of Saul meant the continuance of that favouritism which had enriched them at the expense of the community (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>). They were, too, a very warlike tribe, and Abner was one of themselves, and probably, therefore, the main body of his army, and certainly his most trustworthy men, were Benjamites. Profiting by the delay caused by the halting of David's soldiers round the body of the fallen Asahel, Abner had rallied his men, and posted them on the top of the hill, where they were prepared now to fight on more equal terms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26</a></div><div class="verse">Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end!</span> The Vulgate renders this, "Art thou not aware that desperation is dangerous?" This is a very obvious truth, but probably Abner had in his mind something more statesmanlike. The struggle was for the empire over all Israel, and whoever won would be king over both sides. But every man slain meant a blood feud, which would continue even after the kingdom was united; and Abner probably felt that his own slaughter of Asahel that day would render his position in David's realm difficult and dangerous. Among the Arab tribes quarrels are very common, but bloodshed rare, because of the blood feud which follows. Moderation was thus necessary on both sides, while cruelty and the immoderate use of victory would sow the seeds of future trouble. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab said, <i>As</i> God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up;</span> or as the Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">had gone away, nor followed every man his brother.</span> The Revised Version makes the sense more plain. Joab throws the whole blame, and rightly so, on Abner. David would under no circumstances have attacked Ishbosheth, and Joab with his men had marched to the tank of Gibeon simply to repel an invading force. When there, Joab, doubtless by David's orders, had remained strictly on the defensive, and so unwilling were both armies to fight, that Abner had to resort to a most cruel scene of butchery in order to inflame their passions and force them to begin a conflict of brother against brother. But for Abner's  challenge, both armies would have separated as friends. And Joab still acts upon the same principle of forbearance, and gives the signal for stopping the pursuit. He was not a man of a tender heart, but he was wise and sensible, and fully aware that the slaughter of Abner and his men, even if he could have destroyed them all, would only have rankled in the minds of all Israel, and set them against David and his rule. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-28.htm">2 Samuel 2:28</a></div><div class="verse">So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abner and his men walked all that night</span>. At the end of the chapter we learn that Joab did the same. Each army had about twenty-six miles to march, and the night was less exhausting for a long walk than the day. As soon, then, as Abner saw Joab and his men occupied with the removal of Asahel's body, he withdrew from the hill of Ammah, and, passing through the Arabah, or plain of Jordan, crossed the river by the same ford which he had used when starting on his unfortunate errand, and so returned home. The phrase, all Bithron, shows that this was a district, but nothing more of it is known. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-30.htm">2 Samuel 2:30</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nineteen men...  three hundred and three score men.</span> Though David's "mighties," as they were called, excelled in the use of arms, yet the disparity of numbers is remarkable; for the Benjamites were also famous warriors. We can only account for it by the superiority of the tactics of Joab, who was a man of consummate military skill, and who knew both how to gain a victory and how to use the advantage which the pursuers have over the pursued to the full. If we sometimes wonder that David endured Joab so long, we ought to remember how much he owed to his nephew's genius, and that Joab was always faithful to himself.

As Bethlehem is about eleven miles distant from Gideon, Joab probably marched thither straight from the battlefield, and spent the next day in paying the last tribute of respect to his brother, and in refreshing his men. At nightfall he resumed his march to Hebron, which was fifteen miles further to the south, and where he would arrive on the morning following that on which Abner reached Mahanaim. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm"><title>2 Samuel 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/2.htm" title="2 Samuel 2">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 3 <a href="../2_samuel/4.htm" title="2 Samuel 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was long war.</span> As Ishbosheth reigned only two years, and as "the house of Saul" is the phrase used, it seems probable that after Ishbosheth's murder, during the five years before David's election to the throne of all Israel, the house of Saul had some puppet representative at Mahanaim, and some commander in Abner's place. But after the death of this able man matters would go from bad to worse, and, though David probably remained on the defensive, yet the contrast between the peace and good government of Judah and the misery in Israel made all the tribes wish to put an end to a harassing civil war. It is plain, too, that the Philistines, repelled at first by Abner's skill, had again gained the ascendant, and regarded themselves so completely as the rulers of the country, that they resented immediately with summary violence the bold act of the northern tribes in choosing David to be their common king.

For though contrary to the Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), it was yet looked upon as part of the state of a king, and as such had been practised by Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>), who approached more nearly to the royal dignity than any other of the judges. But it is the rule of the Books of Samuel that they generally abstain alike from praise and 'blame, and allow facts to speak for themselves. But never did a history more clearly deserve the title of  'A Vindication of the Justice of God.' Alike in Eli, in Saul, and in David, their sufferings were the result of their sins, and to the polygamy and lust of the last are due both the crimes which stained his character and the distress of the last twenty years of his life. (For <span class="cmt_word">Amnon</span>, his first born, see ch. 13.)

The Midrash explains Chileab as meaning "Quite like the father." He is called Daniel in the parallel genealogy in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>, and this was probably his real name, and Chileab a name of affection. He must have died young, for Adonijah appears as David's eldest son after the death of Amnon and Absalom; and it is thus natural that he should still be known by the name he bore as a child. <span class="cmt_word">Geshur</span>. The word signifies "Bridgeland," and is the name of two districts, one of which formed the northern part of the tribe of Manasseh, and extended on both sides of the Jordan, from the little Hermon to the sea of Gennesareth (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-13.htm">Joshua 13:13</a>). The other was in Syria (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>), and probably was situated upon some river, though its exact position is not yet known. Talmai, its king, now gave his daughter to be one of David's wives, and though he was probably only a petty prince, still it is a proof of David's growing power that a potentate living at so great a distance was willing to make an alliance with him. Of the other wives and their sons nothing is known except of Adonijah, who inherited, on the death of Absalom, the dangerous position of firstborn; and who, after trying to make his rights good, was put to death by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As Eglah is especially called David's wife,</span> the Jewish interpreters hold that she was the highest in rank in his household, and therefore identical with Michal, who was restored to David while at Hebron.

She is proved to have been a noble woman, with a warm and devoted heart, by the narrative in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8-11</a>. But the harem of a deceased king was looked upon as the special inheritance of his successor; and Absalom, by taking David's concubines (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21, 22</a>), treated his father as a dead man, and committed so overt an act of treason as made reconciliation impossible. So Solomon put his brother Adonijah to death for asking Abishag to wife (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23-25</a>). Still, as Bathsheba there saw no impropriety in Adonijah's request, and as Solomon deposed Abiathar and put Joab to death for complicity, as we must conclude, in Adonijah's request, it was probably part of some scheme of conspiracy, and that, if granted, it would have been used by Adonijah as a proof that the kingdom really was his. Here there was no plot, and as Rizpah had probably always lived apart from Ishbosheth, Abner may have expected that the king would see no difficulty in the matter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul had a concubine, whose name <i>was</i> Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and <i>Ishbosheth</i> said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</div><div class="comm">

But probably the question, <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine?</span>  does not mean a mild expostulation on the king's part, but the purpose to degrade Abner and strip him of his office. Probably after the defeat by Joab at Gibeon, the army was less satisfied with its leader, and his detractors may gladly have encouraged the king to use this opportunity for bringing Abner down to his proper place. Weak kings often try to play the strong man; but the attempt here only drove the imperious soldier to put the matter to the proof, and show that the strength was his. We know that David groaned all his life through under Joab's iron will, and, though he tried, yet that he never succeeded in throwing off the yoke. But Joab never behaved unfaithfully to his sovereign as Abner did here, and his crimes were deeds of violence committed in David's cause. <span class="cmt_word">Am I a dog's head, which against Judah, etc.?</span> The words literally are, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that is for Judah?</span> and are rightly rendered in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Am I a dog's head that belongeth to Judah?</span> Am I at once worthless and a traitor, a thing of no account, and on the side of thy enemies?

Perhaps he looked round upon his officers to see if any would take his side, and, when all were silent, he was too feeble to dare to order the arrest and trial of his too powerful captain. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-12.htm">2 Samuel 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose <i>is</i> the land? saying <i>also</i>, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand <i>shall be</i> with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">under him.</span> The Revised Version renders this "where he was;" but the phrase really means "immediately" (see note on ch. 2:23). And this agrees with the haughty temper of Abner. Without waiting for advice, or allowing his anger to cool, he at once sent trusty envoys to open negotiations with David. <span class="cmt_word">Whose is the land?</span> Abner's meaning in these words is plain. You, David, he seems to say, will answer that the land is mine; for Jehovah has promised it to me. But, as a matter of fact, much of the land is mine (Abner's), or at least belongs to the house of Saul, whose prime minister I am. Yours is an abstract right; mine is actual possession.

Saul's despotic act in giving her in marriage to another man (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>) had been a public disavowal of David as the son-in-law of the royal house, and equivalent to a proclamation of outlawry. David's rights were all declared null by such an act. But now Ishbosheth must with equal publicity reverse his father's deed, and restore to David his lost position. It must have been a most painful humiliation to him to be driven thus to cancel his father's decree, and declare thereby to all Israel that he was unable to refuse hie assent to whatever his rival demanded.  And for this reason David sent his messengers directly to Ishbosheth, because the importance of Michal's surrender to him lay in its being a public act of the state. For <span class="accented">Michal</span>, in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>, we ought to read <span class="accented">Merab</span> (see note there).

As he had paid her father the stipulated price, Michal, by Oriental law, was David's property.

In <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a> he is called Phalti. This word, in Hebrew lexicons, is usually regarded as a contraction for Phaltiyah, "Jehovah is deliverance," while Phaltiel means "El is deliverance." The substitution of <span class="accented">El</span> for <span class="accented">Yah</span> is one of those changes which arose out of the superstitious reverence for the sacred name which to this day causes the word LORD to be read in our Bibles where in the Hebrew are the four consonants Y, H, V, H, which, by attaching to them the vowels belonging to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">edonay</span> (or, <span class="accented">adonay</span>, lord) we make into "Jehovah" (<span class="accented">Yehovah</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her husband went with her along weeping behind her.</span> "Along weeping" is a very awkward rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "going and weeping." The Revised Version is far better, "weeping as he went and followed her." Phaltiel had been Michal's husband for eight or nine years, and his sorrow at losing her excites sympathy for them both. They had evidently loved one another, and she was now going to be but one of many wives; and though David may have desired her restoration because he valued her and cherished the remembrance of their youthful affection, yet there was a large admixture of political motive in his conduct. At Gallim she had been Phaltiel's one jewel, and had been loved for her own sake; at Hebron she would have many rivals. But women of royal rank have often to pay the price of sacrificed affections for the ends of statecraft. Near <span class="cmt_word">Bahurim</span>, on the road from Jerusalem to Gilgal, in the valley of the Jordan, the convoy approached the borders of Judah, and Abner will not allow the weeping husband to enter David's dominions. Painful as was his fate, he had himself done wrong in marrying another man's wife; and if he was weeping now, we may well believe that David had felt equal anguish when Michal was torn from him and sold to another, - for fathers in those days received instead of giving a dowry upon the marriage of their daughters. Saul in this matter was most to blame, and if he had not committed this wrong, David might never have sought an evil solace in multiplying to himself other wives 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-17.htm">2 Samuel 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past <i>to be</i> king over you:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel.</span> Most probably this had taken place before Abner escorted Michal to Hebron, and that he paid David but one visit - that recorded in ver. 20. He would probably not take so decided a step as the surrender of Michal without sounding the elders, that is, the local sheikhs, and finding out how far they were inclined to support David as king of all Israel. When everything was ready he would take Michal to Hebron, and so have the opportunity of arranging with David for future action; and though Ishbosheth would dislike the matter and suspect Abner of ulterior purposes, yet he could not refuse so specious a plea as the escorting of his sister. His previous failure, too, had taught him that Abner was master. We may further be sure that David had everywhere many adherents. All Israel knew that he was marked out by prophecy to be their king, and, moreover, "all Israel and Judah loved him" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>). But when Abner says, <span class="cmt_word">Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you,</span> he makes it probable that, at some time after the defeat at Gilboa, the attempt had even been made to elect David king. But Abner had then opposed it, and his success in resisting the Philistines, and David's unfortunate entanglement with those inveterate enemies of Israel, had made the attempt fail. And now Abner's attempt was to be equally unsuccessful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-18.htm">2 Samuel 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">Now then do <i>it</i>: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath spoken.</span> Here again Abner's statements go far beyond the text of anything recorded in Holy Scripture, but probably they give the popular interpretation of the prophecies respecting David. It will be noticed also that Abner endeavours to meet the general prejudice against David by asserting that he was Israel's destined deliverer from Philistine oppression. As Abner's speech is virtually an acknowledgment of failure, we may also be sure that he had found himself unable any longer to make head against the Philistines on the western side of the Jordan, and that Judah was the only tribe there that enjoyed tranquillity. Everywhere else they had once again established their supremacy. Though a brave soldier, Abner was inferior, not only to David, but also to Joab, both as statesman and general; and the weak Ishbosheth was no help to him, but the contrary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-19.htm">2 Samuel 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the ears of Benjamin.</span> This tribe alone, probably, was really loyal to the house of Saul, their kinsman. But since the withdrawal of the court to Mahanaim, they got but little good from it,  and were left to resist the predatory bands of the Philistines as best they could. So warlike a tribe too would despise Ishbosheth, and long for a braver man to aid them in fighting their enemies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-20.htm">2 Samuel 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him.

Most of them, however, would join Abner on the road, especially those who represented Benjamin and the western tribes. On arriving at Hebron they were honourably received, and, after a feast, they settled the conditions on which David was to be made king of all Israel; and Abner then departed in peace, after giving the assurance that all the tribes would now gladly assemble, and by solemn compact and covenant make David their king. The terms of the league, and the conditions agreed upon for Ishbosheth, are not mentioned, because upon Abner's death the whole plan fell to the ground, and David had to wait for many years before his hopes were fulfilled. But we gather from this covenant and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a> (where see note) that the early kings of Israel were not absolute monarchs. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-21.htm">2 Samuel 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.

The Revised Version is right in rendering "came from a foray," <span class="accented">the troop</span> being a company of men sent out on a predatory excursion. It is not unlikely that David had arranged this expedition in order that his interview with Abner might take place in Joab's absence; and as he returned with "great spoil," he had probably been away for some nine or ten days, during which he had penetrated far into the country of the Amalekites. Had David acted frankly and honourably, Joab would not have stood in the way of his master's exaltation, and the blood feud between him and Abner might have been arranged. But it is evident that David secretly disliked and chafed under the control of his strong-willed and too-able nephew.

There could be no room, he feels, for both of them in David's army, and David meant, he supposes, to sacrifice himself. In hot haste, therefore, he rushes into the king's presence, and reproaches him for what he has done, but covers his personal feelings with professed zeal for his master's interests. Abner is a mere spy, who has come on a false pretext, and with the real intention of learning David's <span class="cmt_word">going out and coming in,</span> that is, his present manner of life and undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">All that thou doest;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all that thou art doing</span>; all that is now going on, and thy plans and purposes. Abner would not only judge by what he saw, but in his interview with David would lead him on to talk of his hopes and prospects. David had little time to explain the real object of Abner's coming, nor was Joab in a mood to listen to anything he said. He had detected his master in secret negotiations, and would regard his excuses as tainted with deceit. And after giving vent to his auger in reproaches, he hurried away to thwart David's plans by a deed of most base villainy. Had David acted openly, all would have been done with Joab's consent and approval.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-26.htm">2 Samuel 3:26</a></div><div class="verse">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew <i>it</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The well</span> - Hebrew, <span class="accented">cistern</span> - <span class="cmt_word">of Sirah.</span> Josephus ('Ant.,' 8.1. 5) says that this cistern was situated about two miles and a half north of Hebron. There was probably a caravanserai there, at which Abner halted, intending to continue his march homewards as soon as the coolness of evening set in. Here Joab's messengers overtook him, and, speaking in David's name  - for otherwise Abner would not have fallen into the trap - asked him to return for further conference, mentioning, perhaps, Joab's arrival as the reason. In this way Abner's suspicions would be set at rest, and it would seem quite natural for him to find Joab waiting for him at the gate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a></div><div class="verse">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth <i>rib</i>, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab took him aside in the gate.</span> As we read in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a> of David sitting "between the two gates," and of "the roof over the gate," and in ver. 33 of "the chamber over the gate," Ewald's idea of there being a roofed inner space, with a guard room over it, as in the mediaeval gate towers in German towns, is probably right. As the "two gates" would make the space between them gloomy, the spot would just suit Joab's purpose. He meets Abner, therefore, in a friendly manner, and drawing him aside, as if to converse with him apart from the people going in and out, there assassinates him. The place was so public that the deed must have been witnessed by multitudes, though the gloom, felt the more by them from the contrast with the bright glare of sunshine outside, had given Joab the opportunity of drawing his sword without Abner's observing it. <span class="cmt_word">For the blood of Asahel his brother.</span> Joab's act was in accordance with Oriental feeling; and the duties of the avenger of blood might with some straining be made to cover his retaliation for an act done by Abner in self-defence (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-26.htm">Numbers 35:26, 27</a>). It is remarkable that Hebron was itself a city of refuge (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>), and this may have led Joab to murder him in the gate, before he had actually entered.  Still, Abner did not expect any such retribution, and supposing that Joab knew of the purpose that had brought him to Hebron, he could not suppose that he would be so indifferent to his master's interests as to put a summary stop to the negotiations for uniting the tribes under David. As it was, this deed brought upon David an evil name, and four or five years had to elapse before the tribes could be induced to take him for their king. Even then his hold over them was far less than it would otherwise have been; for though the shock was gradually got over, yet the suspicion still dung to him. And if the deed was Joab's own act, still David had contributed to it by underhand dealings. His very fear of Joab had caused him to wrong his able general, and given him just cause for resentment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-28.htm">2 Samuel 3:28</a></div><div class="verse">And afterward when David heard <i>it</i>, he said, I and my kingdom <i>are</i> guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I and my kingdom are guiltless.</span> By this David means, not his royal house, but the people generally, who too often have to pay the penalty for the sins of their rulers (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). Necessarily this is the case, wherever the crime is a state crime; but David protests that Abner's murder was a private crime, for which Joab and Abishai alone ought to suffer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-29.htm">2 Samuel 3:29</a></div><div class="verse">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let it rest on the head of Joab.</span> The Hebrew word is very strong, "Let it roll itself," or throw itself upon Joab's head. The force of the expression thus indicates the great excitement under which David was labouring; yet even so it was no slight matter to utter so bitter a curse upon a man so powerful, and whose military skill was so essential to the maintenance of his throne. To a man of David's strong sense of justice, it was a small matter that by Abner's murder the kingdom of the ten tribes was lost perhaps forever; what he hated was the wickedness of this mean act of personal revenge. And thus his imprecations are all such as would be humiliating to a family so distinguished for great physical as well as mental gifts, as the house of Zeruiah. Nor was David content with this; for we gather from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a> that during the intervening years Joab was deprived of his office, and that he regained it only by an act of daring bravery. (For the miserable condition of one suffering with an issue, see <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>, etc.; and for that of a leper, <a href="../../par/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13, 14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Instead of one that leaneth on a staff,</span> some translate "a distaff holder," that is, a poor effeminate creature, fit only for woman's work. The true sense is probably a cripple - one who needs a crutch. <span class="cmt_word">That falleth on the sword;</span> more correctly the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that falleth by the sword.</span> The two last imprecations mean that if any of the race of Joab and Abishai escape these personal blemishes, yet that his fate shall be, in war an inglorious death, and in peace a life of poverty. This curse of David is regarded in the Talmud ('Sanhedr.,' 48.2) as very sinful. Undeniably it was uttered in violent anger, and while Joab's act was utterly base and perfidious, yet he had the excuse for it of Asahel's death and David's double-dealing. The latter made him conclude that the man who had killed his brother was also to usurp his place. Possibly this suspicion was not without reason. As David was strong enough to deprive Joab of his command, it is plain that he had nothing to fear from telling him his plans. Joab would have assented, the blood feud have been appeased by a money payment, and all gone well. But David, it seems, wished to hold Joab in check by giving at least a share in the command to the veteran Abner.

This mourning consisted in going in solemn procession, clad in sackcloth, before Abner's body, carried on a bier to the grave, while David followed as chief mourner; and the emphatic way in which he is called <span class="cmt_word">King David</span> suggests the thought that he went in royal state, so as to give all possible dignity to the funeral. His tears and lamentations with uplifted voice were so genuine and hearty as to move the people to a similar outburst of grief. But while all those at Hebron had proof that David was innocent, the people generally would know only that, when Abner was escorting the king's wife back to him, and arranging for his election to rule over all Israel, he was treacherously murdered at the gate of Hebron by one who was chief over David's army and also his nephew.

But there had been no legal process. He had not been brought in fetters before a judge to be tried for the crime alleged, but murdered for private ends. And thus, "As a man falleth before the children of iniquity, so had he fallen," that  is, by crime, and not by law.

The people would have been grieved and astonished if David had been guilty of this mean murder; but his indignant disavowal of it was in accordance with his usual justice and uprightness, and so it confirmed their high opinion of him. Thus while the more distant tribes condemned David, those who had the best opportunity for forming a judgment gave their verdict in his favour.

And this gradually would be told throughout the tribes, and the final verdict of all well-disposed people would be in David's favour.

His conduct is bold and open, and must have greatly humiliated Joab and Abishai. But though the six hundred approved of David's conduct, and respected him for it, yet probably, as Abner had killed Asahel, they would not have consented to any further punishment than the disgrace inflicted on Joab by his being deprived of the command of David's warriors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a></div><div class="verse">And I <i>am</i> this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah <i>be</i> too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am this clay weak...the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me.</span> David would gladly have had Abner as a counterpoise to Joab's too-great power. As it was, though an anointed king, he had but one tribe loyal to him; the rest were the subjects of a rival; and the Philistines were oppressing all alike. Had Abner's enterprise been carried out, all the tribes would have been united under his sway. He could thus have made head against the Philistines, and Abner, in command of the Benjamites and other tribes, would have curbed the fierce self-will of Joab. As it was, the sons of Zeruiah might be reprimanded, and could not treat David as Abner had treated Ishbosheth; but they were indispensable. David had a strange set of men around him in those outlaws (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and Joab, brave, skilful, and unscrupulous, was a man after their own heart. They had just returned with great booty from a foray under his command; and it was a brave and manly thing in David to reprove him so openly, and dismiss him from his command. Had he attempted more, and Joab had stood upon the defence, there were plenty of "men of Belial" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-22.htm">1 Samuel 30:22</a>) to side with him, and David might have met with the fate threatened him at Ziklag (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). As it was, he proved himself to be king, and Joab, in spite of everything, remained a most faithful officer, and the right hand man in his kingdom, and one even trusted with perilous and disgraceful secrets (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm"><title>2 Samuel 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/3.htm" title="2 Samuel 3">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 4 <a href="../2_samuel/5.htm" title="2 Samuel 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</div><div class="comm">

Their captains would be men of importance with Ishbosheth, who is here described somewhat contemptuously, not as king, nor by his own name, but as "Saul's son." <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth</span>. This place, literally <span class="accented">the Wells</span>, was one of the four towns reserved for the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), though nominally belonging to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>). The note, that it <span class="cmt_word">was reckoned to Benjamin,</span> suggests that it had until quite lately been occupied by the Canaanites, whose flight to Gittaim had no doubt been caused by Saul's cruel attack upon them referred to in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 2</a>. It was thus remarkable that the destruction of Saul's dynasty was the work of the Gibeonites of Beeroth. As we find another of these Beerothites, Naharai, holding the office of armour bearer to Joab (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-39.htm">1 Chronicles 11:39</a>), it seems probable that many of them saved themselves from expulsion by becoming soldiers. But among David's worthies a large number were strangers, and some even men of foreign extraction. Beeroth, however, was probably seized in Saul's reign by the Benjamites, by force, and occupied by them, as its citizens returned in large numbers from the exile (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-25.htm">Ezra 2:25</a>), and are counted as genuine Israelites. Moreover, by thus dispossessing the natives, Saul was able to give his tribesmen "fields and vineyards" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>), which otherwise would have been in violation of the Mosaic Law. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-3.htm">2 Samuel 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gittaim</span>. This word is a dual, and means "the two Gaths;" the one being, probably, the acropolis, or upper town, at the foot of which nestled a new Gath, protected by the ancient stronghold. It is mentioned as belonging to Benjamin in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-33.htm">Nehemiah 11:33</a>; but could not have been an Israelite town at this time, as the Beerothites are described as <span class="accented">sojourners</span>, that is, dwellers in a foreign country. When expelled from Beeroth, they probably seized Gittaim by force, and, on the reconciliation effected by the execution of Saul's sons, returned to their allegiance to Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son <i>that was</i> lame of <i>his</i> feet.

Mephibosheth, the heir, was a cripple, and physically incapable of reigning. Saul had, indeed, sons by a concubine, and grandchildren by his daughter Merab (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). But throughout the history there is no hint that any of these were regarded as the representatives of Saul's house. (For the name Mephibosheth, see note on 2 Samuel 2:8.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</div><div class="comm">

The murder of Ishbosheth is fully described in ver. 7, and is there in its place, while it is out of place in ver. 6. And that the captains would themselves fetch wheat, instead of having it carried from the granary by their men; and that they would go through the king's chamber to obtain it; are both improbable. The very act of going to get wheat at midday, when everybody was having his siesta, would itself be suspicious. The Syriac says nothing about wheat, but that these "wicked men took and smote him." The Vulgate and LXX. lay the blame on the woman who kept the door, the narrative of the latter being as follows: "They entered into the house of Ishbosheth in the heat of the day, and he was asleep in his midday chamber And behold, the woman that kept the door of the house had been winnowing wheat, and she slumbered and slept. And the brothers Rechab and Baanah entered the house without being noticed, and Ishbosheth was asleep on his bed in his chamber, and they smote him," etc. There is, confessedly, considerable confusion in the text, but the versions do not altogether clear it up; and until we have better materials for forming a judgment, we must be content to wait. In ver. 5, instead of "who lay on a bed at noon," the Hebrew has "as he was taking his noonday rest." In ver. 7 the <span class="accented">bed</span> is the divan, or raised bank, which in an Oriental house runs along the wall, and is supplied with pieces of carpet, or cushions, on which to sit cross legged or recline. For sleep, the corners were the favourite places. Even the public rooms had these divans. But Ishbosheth had probably retired for his siesta into a private chamber, where the captains knew that he would be alone. The plain through which they fled was the Arabah, or Jordan valley, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-7.htm">2 Samuel 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night.</div><div class="comm">

Still, had he been victorious, David, as his rival, would certainly have been put to death. <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah hath avenged my lord the king.</span> The ordinary language of the East is so religious that these words imply nothing more than that these wicked men saw in their base act a step towards the carrying out of a Divine purpose. But in thus referring to the common belief that David's kingdom was assured to him by Jehovah, they evidently intended to commend their deed to the really devout mind of the king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-9.htm">2 Samuel 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, <i>As</i> the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David answered.</span> David's answer is worthy of him. His appeal to Jehovah, as One that had saved him in all time of adversity, was a declaration that he had no need of criminals. And throughout he had carefully abstained from taking any steps to bring about the accomplishment of God's will, and had been upright  and forbearing alike to Ishbosheth and Saul. How noble his conduct was we see by the contrast with Macbeth, whose better nature was poisoned and spoiled by the hope that he should be king hereafter. At the end of the verse the force is weakened in the Authorized Version by the insertion of irrelevant words. What David said is, "I slew him in Ziklag, and that was the reward I gave him for his tidings."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-12.htm">2 Samuel 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged <i>them</i> up over the pool in Hebron.

The hands were cut off because they had committed the murder; the feet, because they had brought the head to Hebron. Still, David was violating the spirit of the Mosaic Law. It ordered that the body of a man who had been put to death should be buried the same day (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>). In the face of this humane enactment, it is wonderful that the laws of Christian countries should have allowed the mutilation of the bodies of traitors, and the hanging on gibbets of criminals convicted of smaller crimes. Remembering, therefore, the customs of our fathers, we must not blame David much for suspending the bands and feet of these murderers at the pool of Hebron, that all, when coming for water, might know of their punishment. The head of Ishbosheth was honourably buried in Abner's grave (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-32.htm">2 Samuel 3:32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm"><title>2 Samuel 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/4.htm" title="2 Samuel 4">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 5 <a href="../2_samuel/6.htm" title="2 Samuel 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came all the tribes of Israel.</span> As Ishbosheth reigned only two years, and David's reign at Hebron lasted for seven years and a half, there is an interval of more than five years to be accounted for; and we have given reason for believing (see note on 2 Samuel 2:10) that it must be placed after the death of Ishbosheth. The treacherous murder of Abner, and the tragic fate of Ishbosheth following upon it so rapidly, must have filled all Israel with horror, and made them look upon David as "a bloody man" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>). But gradually his innocence became clear to all except inveterate partisans, and as the prejudice against him passed away, the evident advantage of union under so able a ruler would force itself upon their attention, and their decision would be hastened by the advantage which the Philistines would be sure to take of their anarchy. How much they had profited by it we gather from the haste with which they endeavoured to crush David's kingdom. The enormous gathering at Hebron to anoint David king proves not merely the unanimity of the tribes, but that his election was the result of long preparation and arrangement. We have fuller details of it in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-23.htm">1 Chronicles 12:23-40</a>, where we learn that the people assembled in large numbers, the total being computed in the 'Speaker's Commentary' at 348,222; and it is remarkable that of this vast array only sixteen thousand nine hundred came from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, which were situated in the neighbourhood of Hebron. On the other hand, the two and a half trans-Jordanic tribes sent no less than a hundred and twenty thousand men, and the three unimportant tribes of Zebulun, Asher, and Naphtali mustered a hundred and eighteen thousand; while Issachar was content to send only two hundred, who were all, however, "men that had understanding...  and their brethren were at their commandment." These words suggest the probable explanation of the disparity in the numbers, which to many seems so strange that they think they must be corrupt. Each tribe settled for itself in what way it would be represented, and the more distant sent a large proportion of their men of military age on what would be an enjoyable holiday. As they spent three days at Hebron, the expedition would  occupy, even for those most remote, little more than a week; and it was well worth the while of the tribes thus to come together. It made them feel the value of unity, and gave them a knowledge of their strength. Their tribal independence during the time of the judges had made them too weak even to maintain their liberty; but now, welded by the kingly power into a nation, they soon, not only won freedom for themselves, but placed their yoke upon the shoulders of their neighbours. As for the difficulty of supplying them with food, all would bring victuals from home; and the neighbouring tribes showed great hospitality. Especially we read that those who were nigh unto Hebron, "even as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, victual of meal, cakes of figs, and clusters of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep in abundance: for there was joy in Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-40.htm">1 Chronicles 12:40</a>). It was a grand national festival, joyously kept because the people saw in the election of David an end to all their troubles; and so vast a gathering overbore all opposition, and gave both to them and their king the consciousness of their might. But while we find in the Book of Chronicles the account of this mighty multitude, it is here (ver. 3) expressly said that it was the elders who made a league with David, and anointed him king. The people by their presence testified their joyful assent to what was done; but David's election was made legitimate by the decision of the constituted authorities in each tribe. It would be most interesting to know the various steps taken, and how the agitation grew and spread from tribe to tribe, until all hesitation and resistance were overcome. But the object of this book is to show us the great qualities, the sin, the repentance, and the punishment of the man who added to the old routine of sacrifice bright services of song, and who was the author of that book of devotion which to this day best expresses the feelings of the heart, as well in the joys as in the sorrows of life. The manner of his election throws no light upon his character, and is passed over. Enough to know that in those five years after Ishbosheth's murder David won the approval of all Israel, and that his appointment to the kingdom was by the free choice of the tribes, acting in a legitimate manner, and sending each their elders to Hebron to notify to David their consent; and that their decision was ratified by this joyful gathering of a mighty multitude from all parts of the land. Three reasons are given by the elders for David's election, and we may be sure that they represent the arguments used in their popular assemblies. The first, that they were David's bone and flesh. In other words, the tribes were all of one race, and united by the closest ties of relationship. For the descendants of a common ancestor to be at war with one another was both morally and politically wrong. The second, that David had been their actual leader in war even in Saul's time. His personal qualities, therefore, justified their choice of him to be their deliverer from the evils which had overwhelmed the land after the disastrous defeat at Gilboa, when Saul had no longer the aid of David's presence. The third, that Jehovah had by the mouth of his prophet given the throne to David. It is remarkable that the elders place this last. Their view probably was that the Divine command must be proved by outward circumstances, that so reason might confirm faith. So Saul's public appointment by Samuel was ratified by the people only after he had shown himself worthy to be a king by the defeat of the Ammonites.

Captain; Hebrew, <span class="accented">nagid</span>, prince; so the Revised Version (and see note on 1 Samuel 9:16). The word refers not to military matters, but to the civil administration. David had proved himself a competent leader in war when Saul was king. What Jehovah now gives is the government of Israel in time of peace. The Authorized Version renders "captain" from not perceiving that the Divine promise ensured to David far more than a military chieftainship.

Thus, on Saul's appointment, "Samuel wrote in a book the manner of the kingdom" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-25.htm">1 Samuel 10:25</a>, made most emphatic in the Revised Version by the note in the margin, that the Hebrew is "the book"). The revolt against Rehoboam was the result of the too great extension of the royal power in the days of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Though subsequently the kings seemed to have retained their supremacy, yet when the good and patriotic Jehoiada restored the family of David to the throne, he reverted to the old ways, and "made a covenant between the king and the people" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>). Besides personal rights, the tribes, accustomed to their own leaders, and unused to yield obedience to a central authority, would certainly stipulate for a large measure of tribal independence, and the management of local matters by themselves. <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David king.</span> This was the public ratification of Samuel's anointing, and by it David became <span class="accented">de facto</span>, as well as <span class="accented">de jure</span>, king. The prophets could  not give any right over the people without the consent of the people themselves. But all religious men would see in the Divine command an obligation upon their conscience to accept as their king the man whom the prophet had anointed; and Saul acted in an irreligious manner in seeking to frustrate God's will. And this impiety culminated in his murder of the priests at Nob, which was the open avowal that he would trample all scruples of conscience underfoot.

He had long foreseen the arrival of the time when he would be king of all the tribes, and must have debated in his mind the problem of his future capital. He could not remain in Hebron, as it was too far to the south, nor would haughty tribes such as Ephraim have consented to be merged into Judah. On the other hand, he could not move far away, as Judah was his main strength. But living in its neighbourhood, he must often have noticed the remarkable position of the city of Jebus, and admired its rock girt strength (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>). Though the Jebusites had been conquered by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), and Jerusalem captured (<a href="../../par/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>), yet, as the children of Judah did not occupy it, but "set the city on fire," it seems to have been soon repeopled by its old inhabitants, who there maintained their independence, and, owing to the impregnable nature of its site, could not be treated as Saul treated the Gibeonite inhabitants of Beeroth. Even subsequently, the Jebusite chief who possessed what probably was Mount Moriah, still bore the titular rank of king; for the words in ch. 24:23 literally are, "All this did Araunah the king give unto the king." The explanation of this long independence of the Jebusites is to be found not only in the feebleness of the tribes during the troubled times of the judges, but even mere in the conformation of the site of their stronghold. Jerusalem is situated on the edge of the precipitous wall which forms the western boundary of the valley of the Jordan, and occupies a promontory, on three sides of which are ravines so abrupt and steep that, were it not for their vast depth, they might seem to have been the work of man. On the north side alone it is open to attack, but even there, when the besieger has obtained an entrance, he finds the city divided by another ravine into two parts; whereof the western portion contains the strong citadel of Mount Zion, while the eastern and smaller portion contains the less elevated mountain of Moriah. Though actually raised above the sea level several hundred feet less than Hebron, it seems to the eye more emphatically a mountain-city; and being well nigh encircled by the valleys of Ben-Hinnom and Jehoshaphat, it seems to sit enthroned above the Jordan valley, compared with which it enjoys a cool and refreshing climate. To its inhabitants it was "beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, Revised Version); to the exiles it was "the city of God," to which their hearts ever turned; to us Christians it is the type of Christ's Church on earth, and of his kingdom in heaven. It was an act worthy of David's genius to foresee the great future of the place, and to inaugurate his kingdom by its capture. We gather from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-45.htm">Ezekiel 16:45</a> that at the time when the Hittites were the dominant race in Syria, Jerusalem was one of their fortresses. The name is a dual, literally <span class="accented">Yerushalaim</span>, and probably the town was so called because it consisted of two parts - the upper and the lower city. <span class="accented">Shalaim</span> means the "two Salems," thus carrying our minds back to the city of Melchizedek (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). In <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a> Salem is apparently contrasted with Zion, and so would be the lower town, containing Mount Moriah. Of the other part of the word, <span class="accented">Yeru</span>, numerous derivations are given, of which the only probable one is that which connects it with "Yehovah-yireh" - "God will see to it," the name given to the spot where Abraham on this mountain offered a vicarious sacrifice for his son. We must, however, bear in mind that towns retain the names which they bore in primitive times, and that the name of a Hittite fortress belongs probably to the language of that people. Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither. These words have been a sore puzzle to commentators, and many strange explanations have been given. Rashi says that the <span class="accented">blind</span> meant Isaac, and the <span class="accented">lame</span> Jacob, and that the words referred to an old compact by which Abraham gave Jerusalem to the Jebusites, and that Isaac and Jacob had confirmed this agreement. Unless, then, David was prepared to violate this covenant, he must abstain from the attack. We get no help from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-5.htm">1 Chronicles 11:5</a>, as the words are there omitted, probably because they were not supposed to have any important meaning. The Orientals delighted in dark sayings, and possibly there was here some local reference which the people of Jerusalem would understand, but which is  lost for us. But evidently it was a boastful defiance, and may mean that the Jebusites pretended that it would be enough to post only their feeblest men, the blind and the lame, for defense, and that David would try in vain to break through them. <span class="cmt_word">Thinking</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">to say</span>; answering to our phrase "that is" It should be translated, "meaning." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same <i>is</i> the city of David.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The stronghold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</span> Zion was the hill on the southwestern side of the city; but we learn from ver. 9 that the Jebusites had not occupied the whole of it, but a part only, which was their <span class="accented">stronghold</span>, round which there would be scattered dwellings, as the whole tribe dwelt there. The total area of the hill top was about sixty acres, and it was now quickly covered with houses, and called "the city of David," after its captor. The view of Dr. Birch and others, that the stronghold of Zion was Ophel, is rendered untenable by the fact that this southern tongue of Mount Moriah is completely commanded by other parts of the hill. According to Gesenius, Zion means "sunny;" others render it "the dry hill;" others, "lofty;" and Furst, "the castle." None of these derivations is of any real value, as the word is probably Hittite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, <i>that are</i> hated of David's soul, <i>he shall be chief and captain</i>. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever getteth up to the gutter.</span> The word rendered "gutter" occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>, where it is translated "waterspout." Josephus thinks that it was an underground passage or drain. Ewald argues that it was a precipice, and others that it was a dent or hollow in the rocky face of the ravine, which David had noticed and thought practicable. The view of Josephus, suggested to him probably by his knowledge of the way in which the site of Jerusalem is honeycombed by tunnels, has been wonderfully confirmed by the discoveries made by Sir C. Warren ('Recovery of Jerusalem,' pp. 240, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). At the northern end of the Pool of Siloam he found an arched passage gradually narrowing down from a considerable height, till finally there was a passage of only fourteen inches, and as there was a depth of ten inches of water, there were left but four inches of space for breathing. But through this his men struggled, and, at the end of four hours' labour, they reached the light of day at the spring called the Virgin's Fount. Beginning here on a subsequent day, they went along a passage sixty-seven feet in length, and came to a perpendicular shaft leading up through the solid stone of the hill; and, having scaled this, they next came upon a sloping passage, which finally conducted them to a spot on the hill of Ophel within the fortifications. Now, there are reasons for believing that this passage is older than the wall built by Solomon, and through it, or some such tunnel, Joab and a few men may have worked their way, and so have effected an entrance into the city, which otherwise was impregnable. It was probably the entrance near the Virgin's Fountain which they had observed, and David's words mean, "Whoever will undertake this dangerous enterprise, let him try this underground passage, and when he has entered the fortifications by its means, let him smite the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul," because of the boast of the Jebusites, that their cripples were a match for his heroes. It must be noticed, however, that the K'tib, or written text, has "who hate David's soul;" and as this is what the Jewish Massorites found in the manuscripts, it has more authority than their correction. These Jebusites had probably, in their boastful insult, spoken of David with contempt, and even said, like Goliath, that they would give his flesh to the vultures (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-44.htm">1 Samuel 17:44</a>). We learn from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a> that David promised the office of commander of the host to the man who undertook this exploit; and when Joab had volunteered and succeeded, he regained thereby the post which he had forfeited by the murder of Abner. <span class="cmt_word">The blind and the lame shall not some into the house.</span> The proverb is one of contempt for these poor cripples, and forbids the exercise of hospitality to them. Such people, if they took to mendicancy, were to meet with refusal, though at their own homes they were fit objects of charity. This way of describing tramps as "the blind and lame" arose, we are here told, from this Jebusite taunt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David dwelt in the fort.</span> It was the stronghold or citadel of Zion which David took for his abode; but as he needed space for the dwellings of his mighty men, and for those who would soon flock for trade and security to the capital, David proceeded to fortify the whole of the summit. His works began from "the Millo," rendered "the citadel" by the LXX. Many, deriving the name from a Hebrew root signifying to fill, think that it was a mound, but Nature had herself supplied fit heights for defence, and it is evident that the place was called "the Millo" when David captured the city. We find "Beth-Millo" also in <a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>, where it signifies those who held the citadel of Shechem; and this Mills at Jerusalem was without doubt the old Jebusite keep, and the explanation of its name must be sought in the Jebusite language. As it formed one of the strongest defences of the city, it was rebuilt by Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>), and repaired by Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) in preparation for the Assyrian  attack. Probably it stood at a corner, whence the phrase, "round about from the Millo and inward," or, as it is expressed in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, "from the Millo inward," that is, starting from. the Millo, the walls enclosed the space behind it. In the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>) we find an interesting addition to the narrative, namely, that "Joab repaired the rest of the city." It appears from this that the Jebusites had occupied a good deal of the ground with their habitations, though probably the number of the tribe was not great; or possibly there remained old buildings which were the remains of the Hittite city, and which, being of massive construction, were easily made fit once again for human habitation. We see also proof of Joab's great ability in peace as well as in war. He it was who had captured the stronghold, and it was now his office to arrange the streets and plan of the city, and to assign dwellings to David's mighty men. This would be a work sure to cause jealousy and heart burnings, and no one but Joab, their old commander, could have satisfied them. We find that he assigned to one of them, Uriah the Hittite, a space of ground for a dwelling close to the royal palace. We may suppose, then, that David was now fully reconciled to the "hard sons of Zeruiah" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>), and in the stern wars which followed David's election, he needed and had the full benefit of their vigour and ability.

In this and the six following verses (10-16) we have a summary of David's reign, telling us how he increased in prosperity because of the blessing of "Jehovah God of hosts." The birth of Solomon even is recorded in it, though it took place long afterwards. The insertion in this summary of Hiram's acknowledgment of David proves that this event made a great impression upon the minds of the people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hiram King of Tyre.</span> At first sight it seems as if the Hiram who so greatly aided Solomon in the building of the temple was the same person as David's friend (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-3.htm">2 Chronicles 2:3</a>), but this identification is disproved by the express statement in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a>, and by the chronology. For granting that this account of Hiram's embassy occurs in a general summary, yet David would not long defer the erection of a palace, and in the history of Bathsheba we find, as a matter of fact, that it was then already built (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>). But as Solomon was grown to manhood at his father's death, David's sin must have been committed not more than nine or ten years after he became king of all Israel. Now, we are told by Josephus ('Contr. Apion,' 1:18), on the authority of Menander of Ephesus, that Hiram reigned in all thirty years. But in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10-13</a> we have an account of a transaction with Hiram in Solomon's twentieth year. In another place ('Ant.,' 8:03. 1) Josephus tells us that Hiram had been King of Tyre eleven years when Solomon, in the fourth year of his reign, began the building of the temple. He would thus have been a contemporary of David for only the last seven or eight years of his reign. But the history of this embassy is given as a proof of David's establishment in his kingdom, and cannot therefore be referred to so late a period in his lifetime, when it would have lost its interest. The improbability of two successive kings having the same name is not, after all, so very great, especially as we do not know what the word <span class="accented">Hiram</span>, or <span class="accented">Haram</span>, exactly means. Nor is Menander's statement conclusive against it, where he says that Hiram's father was named Abibal - "Baal is my father." This would probably be an official name, borne by Hiram as the defender of the national religion, or as a priest king. There is, therefore, no real reason for rejecting the statement in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-13.htm">2 Chronicles 2:13</a> that Hiram, or as he is there called Huram, David's friend, was the father of the Huram who was Solomon's ally. <span class="cmt_word">Cedar trees.</span> Cedar wood was greatly valued both for its fragrance and durability, owing to the resin which it contains preserving it from the attacks of insects. Its colour also is soft and pleasing to the eye, as may be seen in the Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster Abbey, the panels of which are of cedar. It did not grow in the Antilibanus, or eastern part of Lebanon, which belonged to Israel, but only in the western part, which belonged to Tyre. Cedar from the time of David became the favourite material at Jerusalem for the interior of houses (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>), and Isaiah charges the people of Samaria with pride for not being content with the native sycomores which had satisfied their fathers, but substituting for it this costly foreign timber (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carpenters and masons.</span> The necessity of importing "workers of wood, and workers of stone for walls," as the words literally mean, proves how miserable was the social state of Israel in David's time. Though they had been slaves in Egypt, yet at the Exodus the Israelites had men capable of working in the precious metals and jewelry, in weaving and embroidery, in wood carving, and even in the cutting of gems (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-30.htm">Exodus 35:30-35</a>). During the long anarchy of the judges they had degenerated into a race of agricultural drudges, whom the  Philistines had debarred from the use of even the simplest tools (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19</a>). Possibly in Saul's time there was a faint restoration of the arts of civilized life (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>); but when we find Joab killing Absalom, not with darts, but with pointed stakes (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>), the weapons probably of most of the foot soldiers, we see that not much had been done even then in metallurgy; and here earlier in his reign David has to send to Tyre for men who could saw a plank or build a wall. When, then, we call to mind the high state of culture and the magnificence of Solomon's reign, we can form some idea of the vigour with which David raised his subjects from a state of semi-barbarism. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David perceived.</span> We may well believe that David had many seasons of despondency and misgiving after he became king. His subjects were brave and energetic, but turbulent, unwilling to obey, and but half-civilized. His election had put an end to civil war at home, but only to arouse the hatred of the enemies who had long oppressed them. The tragical fate, too, of Saul, who, after so many heroic struggles, had seen the earlier glories of his reign fade away, and had sought deliverance from his misery by suicide; all this must have often depressed his spirits. But gradually his fears passed away; and when he had twice defeated the Philistines, and been able to establish his rule, and with it some degree of orderly government throughout the twelve tribes, David saw in all this, and in the embassies from foreign nations, the proof, not of his own ability, but of Jehovah's purpose to <span class="cmt_word">exalt his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> In this David was still a man after God's own heart, in that he felt himself to be only an instrument for the doing, not his own will, but the purpose of his Divine Master.

Of these four, namely, Shammuah, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. were his children by Bathsheba (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, where the names are differently spelt). Besides a variation in the spelling, two sons are mentioned in Chronicles, Nogah and an earlier Eliphelet, whose names are not given here, perhaps because they died young.

On its eastern bank, though Abner kept them from molesting Ishbosheth's kingdom, yet the rule of Saul's house in Ephraim and Benjamin must have been nominal only, and the Philistines would have seen him with pleasure wasting his strength in civil war. After Ishbosheth's death they had tightened their grasp over the central districts of Palestine, though probably content with exacting tribute. They must now have seen with displeasure the consolidation of the tribes under one able ruler. Even in their divided state, the natural strength of the country and the bravery of the people had made it a task too great for the Philistine power entirely to crush Israel's independence. But if they could destroy David before he had had time to establish himself in his kingdom, they would at least prolong indefinitely that feebleness of Israel which had made it so long subject to their dominion. Of this supremacy the Philistines have handed down a token forever in giving to the whole country the name of Palestine, the Philistines' land. <span class="cmt_word">David... went down to the hold.</span> Many commentators identify <span class="accented">the hold</span> with the cave of Adullam, and certainly the account of the brave deed of three of David's heroes, in breaking through the Philistine garrison of Bethlehem to bring him water thence, gives great probability to this view. For we read there that "the Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim, and that David was then in the hold" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13, 14</a>, where note that the word "hold" has the definite article). There are, however, many difficulties connected with this view; for the cave of Adullam was in the valley of Elah, on the road from Hebron to Philistia (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>), but the valley of Rephaim is close to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>), abutting, in fact, upon the valley of Ben-Hinnom. Baal-Perazim also is in the same neighbourhood, being the rocky height which forms the border of Ben-Hinnom, and bounds the valley of Rephaim on the north. Still, the passage in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13, 14</a> seems too precise to be lightly set aside, and we must suppose, therefore, that the Philistines, alarmed by the gathering of half a million of men and women at Hebron, sent messengers throughout their country to assemble their warriors. It was the weakness of ancient warfare that its vast hosts of people melted away as rapidly as they had gathered. For provisions were soon spent, and the men had to return to their farms and their cattle. Thus David, having used some of that large concourse of strong men for the capture of Jerusalem, was left immediately afterwards  with no other protection than that of his "mighty men." Saul had endeavoured to have always round him three thousand trained men (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>), and David subsequently had probably quite as many (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>); but at this early stage he had probably not many more than he had brought with him from Ziklag to Hebron. He could not, therefore, make head against the Philistines coming with all the militia of their land; but, leaving his wives and the wives of his mighty men in the Jebusite stronghold of Jerusalem, we may well believe that he sped away to gather the warriors of Israel. But what seems strange is that he should have gone to the rear of the Philistines, especially as they had come in such vast numbers as to occupy the whole country - a garrison, for instance, being posted at Bethlehem, and doubtless at other fit spots. Still, this country was well known to David, and he could gather there old friends, whose bravery he had often tried before. And while thus waiting for the mustering of such as God would move to help him, in deep distress at so terrible a reversal following so quickly upon his exaltation, a strange longing for water from the well of his native town seized him. He was suffering apparently from fever of body as well as from distress of mind, and soon there was relief from both. For three of his heroes heard the words burst from his parched lips, and, hastening to Bethlehem, broke through the Philistine garrison, and filled a waterskin from the well at the gate of the city. Such an act naturally made a great impression upon David. What room was there for despair when he had such men around him? Pouring out, then, the water as a drink offering to Jehovah, his heart was now filled with hope, and inquiring of the Lord whether he might attack the Philistines, he received the assurance which he had already gathered from the exploit of his heroes, that God would deliver them into his hand.

Occupying it in vast numbers, the Philistines sent out bodies of men to plunder the whole country, while a sufficient force watched Jerusalem, intending to take it by famine. The Rephaim were an aboriginal race, first mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, and evidently in early times very widely spread in Palestine. The idea that they were giants has no more to be said in its favour than that they were ghosts - the meaning of the word in <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14, 19</a>. No sensible philologist will endeavour to explain the names of these primitive races and of their towns by Hebrew roots, though there has been too much of this craze in past times. The Rephaim seem. however, to have been physically a well-developed people, and several races of Canaan of great stature are described in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a> as having belonged to them, as did Og, who was a man of extraordinary dimensions (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>).

It is called Mount Perazim, "the hill of breaches," in Psalm 28:21, and as we have seen, it was the rocky height on the north of the valley of Rephaim. David must, therefore, have stolen round the army of the Philistines, creeping, probably by night, up to this ridge of Ben-Hinnom, and thence at the dawn of day have rushed down upon the camp. And his onset was sudden and irresistible, like the rush of the waters of some mountain lake when, swollen with rains, it bursts through the opposing dam, and carries hasty destruction to everything that lies in its way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left their images.</span> This is a further proof of the suddenness of the attack, and the completeness of the Philistine discomfiture. For <span class="accented">images</span> we find "gods" in the parallel place in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, and the word used here is rendered "idols" in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>. As the Philistines supposed that these images of their deities would ensure their victory, they would set great store by them, as the Israelites did by the ark (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), and the French by the oriflamme. Their capture, therefore, was a feat as great as the winning of the eagle of a Roman legion. <span class="cmt_word">David and his men burned them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">took them away.</span> This translation of the Authorized Version, made to force the words into verbal agreement with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, is utterly indefensible; and, like most wrong things, it is absurd. The Bible cannot be improved by frauds, and really the two narratives complete one another. David and his men carried off these images as trophies, just as the Philistines carried off the ark (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>). But the ark proved mightier than the Philistine gods, and in terror the people restored it to Israel. But no avenging hand interfered to rescue these gods, and, after being paraded in triumph, they were made into a bonfire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-22.htm">2 Samuel 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines came up yet again.</span> Their first defeat had probably not been accompanied by much slaughter; for David's men were few in number, though brave as lions. Retreating then to some distance, the Philistines called in their garrisons, and waited also for reinforcements from home, and then advanced again to the same spot. And as David was prepared to attack them in front, he also must now  have gathered round him the chivalry of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-23.htm">2 Samuel 5:23</a></div><div class="verse">And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; <i>but</i> fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not go up.</span> The attack in front is forbidden, and the answer shows that the priest with the ephod did more than give a mere affirmative or negative reply. For David receives full instructions. Taking advantage of the valleys, he is to creep round into the rear of the Philistines, and approach them under cover of a thicket of baca trees. <span class="cmt_word">Mulberry trees;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">baca trees.</span> This suggests the idea that David's place of attack was the Baca valley (<a href="../../par/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>), and that there was such a valley, though this is not certain. For the Revised Version translates "valley of weeping," concluding that <span class="accented">baca</span> is not there a proper name. By baca trees the LXX. and Vulgate "pear trees," but as <span class="accented">bacah</span> means "to weep," it is probably some balsamic shrub, from which a resin exudes. The Revised Version puts here in the margin, "balsam trees." Dr. Tristram thinks it was a sort of aspen, but the authority of the Vulgate is great in such matters, as Jerome obtained his information in Palestine itself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-24.htm">2 Samuel 5:24</a></div><div class="verse">And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sound of a going;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">a marching.</span> Under the cover of this thicket David was to wait until he heard the sound as of the regular tramp of an army in the tops of the baca trees. It would be in the morning that the wind would shake the treetops, but the sound was to be something more than the soft whispers of a gentle breeze. A gale was to put them into sudden motion, and then the soldiers would know that their Jehovah had gone forth to battle, and David must immediately <span class="accented">bestir</span> himself. The enthusiasm of his men must not cool down, but as soon as the wind rustled he must charge the enemy, and his warriors, feeling that they were going with the host of God, would break down all resistance by their impetuous onset. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Geba until thou some to Gazer.</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-16.htm">1 Chronicles 14:16</a> "Gibson" is substituted for "Geba," and it is one of those corrections which a commentator is inclined to adopt, because it makes all things easy. For Gibeon lay directly on the road from the Rephaim valley towards Gazer, and the armies must have passed it in the fight. But if "Geba" be the right reading here, then the battle must have been most sternly contested. For it is the "Gibeah of Benjamin," Hebrew, "Geba of Benjamin," described in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-16.htm">1 Samuel 13:16</a>. The Philistines had a garrison there in Saul's time (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-3.htm">1 Samuel 13:3</a>), and had probably again occupied it as a military post after their victory at Gilboa. To reach it the line of retreat would go nine miles northward over difficult ground; but this was not disadvantageous to a retreating army as long as it remained unbroken, and the Philistines would expect to be able to make a successful defense at a strong citadel like Geba, held by a garrison of their own troops. But when driven by David's "mighty men" from this fortified hill, being hemmed in by the defile of Michmash on the east, they would have no choice but to hurry down the valleys to the west, and, still passing by Gibson, so flee to Gazer. Thus the reading "Geba" implies a stout and long resistance ending in a most complete victory. And confessedly this was a decisive battle, fought with larger forces, and causing far larger loss to the Philistines than that at Baal-Perazim, where, attacked by only a few men, they were seized with panic, and saved themselves by a headlong flight. <span class="accented">Gazer</span> lay upon the border of Ephraim, and was one of the royal cities of the Canaanites, and so strong that it was left in the hands of its old possessors (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>). Subsequently Solomon fortified it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17</a>), as being the key of the defiles which led from Ekron and the plain of Philistia up to Jerusalem. We also find it mentioned as an important military post in the days of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52). The pursuit would naturally stop here, as the fugitives would now be in their own country, and succour would be close at hand. Probably, too, the Canaanites who held the fortress were friendly to them, and gave them shelter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm"><title>2 Samuel 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/5.htm" title="2 Samuel 5">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 6 <a href="../2_samuel/7.htm" title="2 Samuel 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">Again, David gathered together all <i>the</i> chosen <i>men</i> of Israel, thirty thousand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David gathered together.</span> The long subjection to the Philistines was at an end, and David's first care is to bring the ark of Jehovah from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem. In this he had a twofold object. For, first, it was an act of piety, testifying David's gratitude to God, who had so quickly raised him from the condition of a despairing fugitive hiding away in the cave of Adullam to that of a victorious king reigning over an independent and free people. But David had also a political purpose. The weakness of Israel in the past was the result of its divisions, he would heal this by giving it a capital, whither the tribes would come up for worship, and where they would feel that they formed one nation. David had seen the evils of a divided sovereignty, when he and Ishbosheth were wasting the strength of Israel in civil war. For more than half a century he remedied this, but before there had been time for the union of the tribes to be cemented by the gradual influence of religion. Solomon's oppressive levies of unpaid workmen, forced to labour in his costly buildings, and the despotic stupidity of Rehoboam, broke up united Israel into two feeble states, which henceforward had to struggle hard for a mere existence. The condition of Israel was very similar to that of the United States of North America before their great civil war; except that their president, elected by all the people, and their Congress at Washington, were far stronger bonds of union than any that were possessed by the Israelites. But when there was danger of even these failing to keep them together as one people, the statesmen of the north put forth their utmost powers, and spared neither life nor treasure, because they saw clearly that the victory of the south meant the breaking up of their empire into a multitude of feeble governments, which, by their mutual jealousies, would paralyze and thwart one another. With equal discernment David endeavoured to counteract the jealousy and separate action of the tribes, which was bringing about the disintegration of Israel, by giving them a point of union. Had he gone further north for his capital, he might, perhaps, have overawed the stubborn tribe of Ephraim, which was always the most unmanageable of the sections of Israel. But the situation of Jerusalem upon the borders of Benjamin and Judah, on a hill-top which neither had really possessed, and which was marked out for noble use by its wonderful natural conformation, fully justified David's choice; and it has had the assent of mankind ever since. David then made this unrivalled spot his capital, and placed there, first of all, his royal residence, whereby it became the centre of all public business and of the administration of law; and, secondly, as a matter of still higher importance, he made it the headquarters of their national religion and the abode oF their God. We see the weight of this religious influence in the anxiety of Jeroboam to counteract it, and in the strength given to Rehoboam by the migration into Judah of those who valued  the temple services more than their worldly prosperity. Even Saul had valued the national religion, and had established its headquarters at Nob; but, giving way to the ungoverned anger of a despot, he had destroyed his own work. It was left to one who to the bravery of a soldier added the discernment of a statesman to consolidate the tribes into a nation by establishing their religion upon a sure and influential basis. For this reason also he made their services full of delight and enjoyment by the institution of choral chants and the use of instruments of music; while the psalms which his singers recited were so spiritual and ennobling that we to this day use them in our solemn worship. Granting that there are expressions in them harsher and more intolerant than a disciple of the loving Jesus would now apply to any earthly enemy, yet, as a whole, the Psalms, written in these rough far off times, still form our best book of devotion! In the parallel place in the First Book of Chronicles we have the narrative of this re-establishment of the Mosaic Law given as looked at on the Levitical side, and with many interesting additions. Here the narrator looks at it with the eye of a statesman. We must not, however, suppose that the history there given is arranged in chronological order, as, if so, the two victories in the Valley of Rephaim would have both taken place in the three months during which the ark was resting in the house of Obed-Edom. If this were so, then David would first have had more than three hundred and forty thousand warriors with him at Hebron to anoint him, and with their aid would have captured Jerusalem. lie would next have assembled thirty thousand picked men to bring the ark up to Zion; and yet would have had only his body guard of "mighty men" wherewith to fight Israel's battles and win its independence. Most probably the order, both here and in Chronicles, is not chronological, and the course of events was as follows. With the help of the men gathered at Hebron David captures Jerusalem. As soon as it is made safe they withdraw, and leave him occupied with planning out and building his city. Alarmed at the vast concourse at Hebron, and made angry by David's seizure of a strong fortress, the Philistines hastily pounce upon him in numbers too vast for him to resist. He escapes, leaving but a few men to defend Jerusalem, and hides in his old fastness. Encouraged there by finding three of his mighties more than a match for the garrison at Bethlehem, he gathers the mere valiant spirits, and makes a sudden attack upon the Philistines, who were engaged in ravaging the country as a punishment for its rebellion. They are defeated, but with no great loss; and so with uubroken strength they again invade the country, and march up once more to Jerusalem, prepared to fight a pitched battle, and seize that fortress as the prize of victory. Again, David, with far larger forces, surprises them, and, driving them from ridge to ridge, so utterly vanquishes them that the power of Philistia was destroyed forever. It was after this double victory that Hiram, King of Tyre, whose dominions bordered upon the Philistines, and who had found them disagreeable neighbours, made a close alliance with David; and so at length, free from all fear at home, and honoured abroad, he was able to turn his thoughts to the consolidation of his kingdom and the establishment of Jehovah's worship. And in the Book of Chronicles we have the details of that spiritual service of psalmody which David added to the Levitical routine of sacrifice, and which bears the significant name of "prophecy," as being the expression of the moral and spiritual side of the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>). Instead of "Again David gathered," the words of the Hebrew are" And David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel." The first gathering was at Hebron (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>), and before they came David must have given his consent to their wishes, and invited their presence at his anointing. They soon gather together a second time to endow their new kingdom with the safeguards necessary for their spiritual welfare, and the maintenance among them of morality and virtue and the fear of God. <span class="cmt_word">Chosen men.</span> This usually means picked men fit for war. But doubtless on this occasion the eiders and all good men possessed of power and influence would be present to strengthen the king's hand. <span class="cmt_word">Thirty thousand.</span> A large number, but not too large. David probably chose one of the great feasts for the occasion, and by the presence of a large number of warriors, and the display of much military pomp, he would impress upon the minds of the people the value of religion. They would thus learn also to respect their new capital as being the place where was the presence of their Deity, and where they were to come to worship him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">And David arose, and went with all the people that <i>were</i> with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Baale of Judah.</span> We learn from <a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 60</a> that Baalah, or Kirjath-Baal, "the city of Baal," was the old Canaanite name of Kirjath-jearim, the "city of woods." It lay about eight miles westward from Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>). The preposition "from" is very startling, as really David went <span class="accented">to</span> Baale. Yet all the versions have it, but they put on Baale an incorrect meaning. Baal means "lord," "master," and they render, "David went with all the people that were  with him <span class="accented">from</span> [or, <span class="accented">of</span>] the citizens of Judah," understanding by "master" a householder, one who was master of a family. The real explanation probably is that the narrator wrote according to the sense, and not according to the grammar. The thought in his mind was the bringing up of the ark from its long resting place, and not the prior physical necessity of going down to the place where it was. <span class="cmt_word">With all the people.</span> David had consulted with "the captains of thousands and hundreds, and every leader" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>), and it was with their good will that he drew the ark of God out of its long concealment. A select body of these nobles, or sheiks, would accompany the king, while the rest, with their attendants, would be posted along the eight miles of road. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name is called by the name.</span> In the Hebrew, the word "name" is twice repeated, the words literally being, <span class="accented">the ark of Elohim, whereon is called the Name, the Name of Jehovah of Sabaoth.</span> Most of the versions omit the second <span class="accented">Name</span>, and the translators of the Authorized Version also felt it to be a difficulty, which they have tried to escape by inserting words between the two. Really it is a most interesting sign of the existence at this early date of a special reverence for the name "with four consonants" which we call "Jehovah." Subsequently it was never pronounced, but the word "Lord" was read instead, in the Revised Version, the importance of the passage is well brought out by the first Name being written with a capital, of the use of which the Revisers are very chary. With their usual inconsecutiveness, they retain Lord for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, though this is "the Name," and though they have restored the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in several less important places. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that <i>was</i> in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they set the ark of God</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">made it ride</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon a new cart.</span> This was contrary to the Levitical Law, which required that only Levites should bear the ark, and that it should be veiled even from their eyes (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). But this mistake is not surprising. It is easy enough for us to turn to our Bibles, and see what the exact letter of a command was. But such reference was no easy matter when the Law was contained in manuscripts which were rare and costly. We cannot imagine that David or even Abiathar carried a manuscript about with them in their wanderings. David very probably had a considerable knowledge of the Pentateuch, gained in Samuel's schools, and stored up in his memory, as was the custom in old days when books were scarce. But this knowledge would be chiefly of its narratives and doctrines, and would comprise such portions as Samuel thought most fitting to influence the lives of his scholars. Abiathar probably added to this a knowledge of all such ritual as was in daily use in the sanctuary at Nob. He had fled thence in terror, escaping alone from the cruel destruction of the priests by Saul's decree; but even there the restoration of the Levitical services had been too recent to have given time for much study of the old Law. We can quite believe that the murder of the priests at Nob, following upon the catastrophe at Shiloh, had reduced the knowledge of the priests to a very low ebb. Now, the exact way of bearing the ark was a matter that had long been dismissed from their memories, but they would call to mind that it had been brought to Abinadab's house in a new cart drawn by oxen; and they would take this as a precedent, which would justify them in acting in the same manner a second time. But in so solemn a matter the priests ought to have made diligent search, and have gone for instruction to the copies which they possessed of the Divine Law. David did so subsequently (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>), but possibly there was no such copy at present in Jerusalem, and they would have to go to Ramah, where Samuel would deposit whatever records he had saved from the ruin of Shiloh, and where the great work of the prophets was to study the sacred books, and even copy them. But this want of inquiry and easy assumption, that as the ark was brought in a cart to Abinadab's house, so in a cart it should be carried away, was an act of great irreverence, and all the guilty were punished. The heaviest blow fell on the house of Abinadab, which lost a dear son. Entrusted for seventy years with the care of so sacred a symbol of Jehovah's presence, Abinadab and his family ought to have made a special study of the taws concerning it. Apparently they left it very much to itself; for it is never said that God blessed them for their care of it as he did Obed-Edom. And David also was in fault; for he ought to have commanded the priests to make diligent search. His punishment was the breaking out of the Divine wrath, terrifying the people, and turning the joy of the day to mourning. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah;</span> really, <span class="accented">that was upon the hill. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Uzzah and Able, the sons of Abinadab.</span> "Sons" in Hebrew is used in a large sense, and these two men were probably the grandsons of Eleazar, the son of Abinadab, who had been set apart to keep the ark. For seventy years, as it seems, lind passed since the ark was hurriedly put in Abinadab's house, namely, twenty during the Philistine supremacy up to the battle of Ebenezer, forty during the reign of Saul, and about ten since. As Eleazar must have been thirty years of age for his consecration to be legal, he must have died long ago, and his sons would be old and decrepit  men. His grandsons would be in the prime of life.

The most probable explanation is that the first half of the verse has been repeated from ver. 3 by the error of some copyist, and that the original words were "Uzzah and Ahio drove the new cart with the ark of God, and Ahio went before the ark." While Uzzah walked at the side, Ahio went before the oxen to guide and manage them, as the Basques may be seen at the present day doing in the south of France.

More sensibly Thenius regards it as the right reading, and the words here as a corruption of it, caused by some scribe misspelling the words, which are nearly identical. In our version the ambiguous meaning of the word "played" makes the passage less startling. For "they danced with all cypress woods" is unintelligible. The musical instruments mentioned here are the harp, Hebrew <span class="accented">chinnor</span>, a guitar; the psaltery, Hebrew <span class="accented">nebel</span>, a kind of <span class="cmt_word">harp</span> of a triangular shape, with the point downwards; the <span class="cmt_word">timbrel</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">tof</span>, a tambourine or small drum; the <span class="cmt_word">cornet</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">mena'na'</span>, a bar on which were a number of loose metal rings, which were shaken in time to the music, but others think that "castanets" are meant, which are pieces of wood beaten in time. The Revised Version adopts this rendering. And finally <span class="cmt_word">cymbals</span>. For "cornets" we find in the parallel place "trumpets," whence the translators of the Authorized Version took their rendering; but the Hebrew word means "things to shake." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth <i>his hand</i> to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nachon's threshing floor.</span> In the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-9.htm">1 Chronicles 13:9</a>) we find "the threshing floor of Chidon," and "Chidon" is proved to have been a proper name by the feebleness of the attempts made to find for it a meaning. We therefore gather that "Nachou" is also a proper name, but otherwise we should certainly have translated it "a fixed threshing floor." The people did indeed thresh or trample out their corn often on summer threshing floors (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a>), that is, on fitting spots in the fields themselves. But as a large quantity of earth was sure in this cash to be mixed with the corn, they preferred to use places with solid floors or pavements, which lasted for many generations, and often became well-known spots (<a href="../../par/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>). Even if "Nachon" be a proper name, this would be a permanent floor, paved with stones, the approaches to which would be worn and made rough by the tracks of the carts bringing the corn. <span class="cmt_word">Here the oxen shook it;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">stumbled</span>, and so the Revised Version. Nothing is said of the ark being in danger. Uzzah's act was one of precaution. The ground was rough, the oxen stumbled, and he put forth his hand to hold the ark till the cart had reached level ground. If the threshing floor was formed in the natural rock, those who have been in Spain, and seen how the tracks in the Pyrenees are worn by the native carts into deep ruts in the solid stone, can well understand that the neighbourhood of this much-frequented spot would need very careful driving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for <i>his</i> error; and there he died by the ark of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Error</span>. The word so translated is one quite unknown, and Ewald renders it "unexpectedly." The Revised Version puts "rashness" in the margin. But all three alike are mere guesses, of which "error" is that approved by Keil and others. The Syriac has the same reading here as that found in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-10.htm">1 Chronicles 13:10</a>, namely, "because he put his hand to the ark." This would require the insertion of four or five letters in the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">By the ark.</span> The word translated "accompanying the ark" in ver. 4.

Uzzah's death was probably caused by apoplexy, and the sudden effort of stretching forth his hand and seizing the ark had been its immediate cause. So tragic an event spoiled the happiness of the day, filled all present with disappointment, made them break off in haste from the grand ceremonial, and placed David before his subjects in the position of a malefactor. He had prepared a great religious festival, and Jehovah had broken in upon them as an enemy. In his first burst of displeasure he called the place Perez-Uzzah, the word "Perez," or "Breach," conveying to the Hebrews the idea of a great calamity (<a href="../../par/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15</a>) or of a sudden attack upon a foe (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). The historian adds that the place bore this name unto his day; but we cannot tell whether these are the words of the original compiler of the Book of Samuel, or, as is more probably the case, those of some subsequent editor or scribe. Many such remarks are supposed to have been inserted by Ezra and the men of the great synagogue.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David was afraid</span>. This was his next feeling. Neither he nor Uzzah had offended wilfully, and so severe a punishment for an "error" made him dread the presence of so dangerous a thing as the ark seemed to be. Instead, therefore, of taking it into "the city of David," he turns aside and leaves it in the house of the nearest Levite. In both his anger and his dread David manifests himself to us as one whose ideas about God were somewhat childish. He regards Jehovah as a powerful and capricious Being, who must be appeased. He had attained to juster views in <a href="../../par/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16</a>. and other such trustful hymns. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Obed-Edom.</span> We find two Levites of this name among David's officials - one belonging to the family of Merari, a singer and doorkeeper for the ark (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-18.htm">1 Chronicles 15:18, 21, 24</a>); the other of the family of Korah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-4.htm">1 Chronicles 26:4, 5</a>). And as it is there said that "God blessed him," he probably it was into whose house the ark was taken. He is called a Gittite, because he belonged to Gath-Rimmon, a Levitical city in the tribe of Dan (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-45.htm">Joshua 19:45</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>).

But before he returns to his purpose, he commands that proper inquiry be made. The priests must examine the holy book, and, having learned from it where his former conduct was wrong, he assembles the people once again to carry the ark to its home (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 12-15</a>).

"Evidently the way to the holy city was a way of blood. The stained streets of Zion, the rivers of blood, the slaughtered heaps and the blaze of altar fires formed a strange contrast to the dancing, the singing, and the harping of the multitudes who crowded the city" (Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 288). It is not necessary to suppose, with some objectors, that the ark waited till each sacrifice was completed, or that the road thus lined with victims was many miles in length. The ark did not remain at Perez-Uzzah, but was carried in silent awe to the house of a Levite; and such a house probably was not to be found until they were inside the city walls. There were no country houses in a region lately twice ravaged by the Philistines. But there is an objection to this view, namely, that it is not the sense of the Hebrew. What is there said is that at starting, after stepping six paces, David sacrificed an ox and a fatling (by the hands, of course, of the priests), to ask a blessing upon the removal of the ark, and avert all misfortune. In Chronicles we read nothing of this, but of a sacrifice of seven bullocks and seven rams, offered by the Levites. The one was David's offering made at the beginning, to consecrate the removal; the other was made at the end, and was a thank offering of the Levites, because they had carried the ark safely (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a>). The Vulgate has a remarkable addition to ver. 12, taken doubtless by Jerome from manuscripts which existed in his day. It is as follows: "There were with David seven choruses and a calf as victim." The fact is not in itself improbable, and means that the musicians and dancers were divided into bands which mutually relieved one another. And as a sacrifice was also a feast, each band had a calf provided for it. The LXX. omits the thirteenth verse altogether, and substitutes for it, "And seven choruses accompanied him. bearing the ark, and a calf and Iambs as a sacrifice." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">And David danced before the LORD with all <i>his</i> might; and David <i>was</i> girded with a linen ephod.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David danced.</span> The word used means the springing round in half circles to the sound of music. Conder has given a very interesting account of the dancing of the Malawiyeh, which consisted in turning round in whole circles, resting on the heel of the left foot ('Herb and Moab,' p. 65, etc.). As David danced with all his might, he was evidently strongly excited with religious fervour. We have the expression of his feelings in the psalm composed for this occasion (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-7.htm">1 Chronicles 16:7-36</a>); subsequently it seems to have been rearranged for the temple service, as it is broken up into <a href="../../par/psalms/96.htm">Psalm 96</a>. and Psalms 105:1-15. Dancing was usually the office of the women (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>); but men may also have often taken part in it, as Michal's objection was that it was unbefitting a king. <span class="cmt_word">David was girded with a linen ephod.</span> David wore this as a tightly fitting garment, which left him free to exert himself in the dance. So far from the use of it being an assumption of the priestly office, it was regarded by Michal as an act of humiliation, as it was a dress worn even by a child when admitted to service in a priest's family (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). Probably David did mean to rank himself for the time among the inferior servitors of the ark. He might have claimed more. In the theocracy he was the representative of Jehovah,  and his anointing was a solemn consecration to a religious office. To have burned incense or offered sacrifice would have been to invade the priestly office, an office parallel to "the administration of the Word and the sacraments," denied, in the Thirty-Seventh Article of the Church of England, to princes. To wear the garb of a servitor was to do honour both to Jehovah and to his priests.

This tent would he arranged as nearly as possible like that erected by Moses in the wilderness.

So, too, there is no doubt of the third; it means "a cake of raisins" (see <a href="../../par/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, in which latter place raisins, or dried grapes, are expressly mentioned, boldly rendered in the Authorized Version "wine"). The Revised Version has given the correct rendering of the passage. The second word occurs only here, but the rendering of the Authorized Version is that of the Jews; and as it is some common domestic term not likely to be found in literature, but well known in every kitchen, they are most probably right. On the same sort of local authority Jerome renders it in the Vulgate "a piece of beef for roasting." As it is coupled with the bread and the raisin cake, we may feel sure that it was a portion of the flesh of the animals which had been killed in Sacrifice, and which the people were now permitted to take to their homes.

The Levites were to occupy a humble social position (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), and Michal's words are a proof that such was in David's time the case. The language of Michal is that of a woman vexed and irritated. After reminding David of his high office as "King of Israel," she reproaches him for appearing on a grand public occasion without the upper and becoming robe in which an Oriental enwraps himself. And this he had done before the female slaves of his own servants, with no more self-respect than that shown by the "vain fellows." "Vain" is the "raca" of <a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, and means "empty," void of virtue, void of reputation, and void of worldly means. The Hebrews, when expressing the greatest possible contempt for a man, called him an "empty," and no word could be found better conveying the meaning of thorough worthlessness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21</a></div><div class="verse">And David said unto Michal, <i>It was</i> before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was before the Lord.</span> The Hebrew is much more forcible than the confused rendering of our version. "Before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over Jehovah's people, over Israel, yea, before Jehovah I have rejoiced" (Authorized Version, "played;" but see notes on ver. 5). The preference of David over Saul was proof that that king's affectation of royal state, and his self-importance, were not pleasing in God's eyes.

It is noticed as a proof that the blessing of God did not rest upon her; and as such it was regarded by the people, and doubtless it lessened David's affection for her. We must not, however, suppose that he imposed upon  her any punishment further than this verbal reproof. Nor does the interest lie in Michal's conduct, but in the glimpse which the narrative gives us of David's tender piety towards God, so exactly in agreement with the feelings which animate very many of the psalms. To unite with this a harsh bitterness to the woman who was his first love, who had so protected him in old time, and whom he had summoned back at the first opportunity because of his affection for her, is a thing abhorrent in itself, and contrary to David's character. His fault in domestic matters rather was that he was over fond, not that he was unfeeling. A little more sternness towards Amnon and Absalom would have saved him much sorrow. As for Michal, the story sets her before us as earing a great deal for David, and not much for Jehovah. She could not have approved of such a number of rivals in David's household, but she had not lost her love for him. And the narrative represents her as not having Jehovah's blessing in a matter so greatly thought of by Hebrew women, and as valuing too highly royal state, and forgetting that above the king was God. But she did David no great wrong, and received from him nothing worse than a scolding. In the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>) the matter is very lightly passed over; and the reason why it holds an important place in this book is that we have here a history of David's piety, of his sin and his punishment. In itself a slight matter, it yet makes us clearly understand the nature of David's feelings towards Jehovah. It is also most interesting in itself. For David is the type of a noble character under the influence of grace. Michal, too, is a noble character, but she lacked one thing, and that was "the one thing needful." The removal of the ark is a matter so important as to call for careful consideration. For the time it established two centres of worship - one with the ark at Zion, the other at Gibeon. The ark in Saul's days had been forgotten (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3</a>). It had long lain in the house of a simple Levite in the city of woods, and Saul's religious ideas were too feeble for him to be capable of undemanding the importance of establishing a national religion. Still, such as they were, they made him summon Ahiah, the grandson of Eli, to be his domestic priest (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>); and subsequently he even set up at Nob the tabernacle with its table of shewbread, and other holy furniture, saved somehow from the ruin of Shiloh, with Ahimelech as high priest (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>). But when in a fit of senseless jealousy he destroyed his own work, the nation was left for a time without an established religion. Gradually, however, this primary necessity for good government and national morality was supplied - how we know not; but we find a tabernacle at Gibeon, with the altar of burnt offerings, and the morning and evening sacrifice, and apparently the same service as that erewhile set up at Nob; only Zadok of the line of Eleazar is high priest (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>). He thus belonged to the senior line, while the last survivor of the race of Ithamar, Abiathar, Eli's great-grandson, was with David. Gibeon was in the centre of the tribe of Benjamin, some few miles from Jerusalem, with Nob lying halfway between; and probably Saul had permitted this restoration of Jehovah's worship at Gibeon, both because he half repented of his deed, and because the worship there was ministered by priests not allied to Ahimelech and Abiathar. But now the ark, which was Jehovah's throne, had been brought out of its obscurity, and solemnly placed in a tabernacle in Zion, with Abiathar, David's friend, the representative of the junior line, as high priest; and probably the only difference in the service was that David's psalms were sung to music at Zion, while the Mosaic ritual, with no additions, was closely followed at Gibeon. There was thus the spectacle of two high priests (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>), and two rival services, and yet no thought of schism. Zadok had been one of those foremost in making David king of all Israel (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-28.htm">1 Chronicles 12:28</a>); he and Abiathar were the two who moved Judah to bring David back after Absalom's revolt (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>). The whole matter had grown out of historical facts, and probably David always intended that Zion should absorb Gibeon, and be the one centre required by the Levitical Law. But he was content to wait. Had he acted otherwise a conflict would necessarily have arisen between the rival lines of the priesthood, and between Abiathar and Zadok, the two men who represented them, and who were both his true friends. We find even Solomon doing great honour to the tabernacle at Gibeon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a>, etc.), but after the temple was built it passed away; and the race of Ithamar, weakened by the calamity  at Shiloh, and still more by the cutting off of so many of its leading members at Nob, never recovered itself after Abiathar was set aside by Solomon for taking part with Adonijah. The line continued to exist, for members of it returned from Babylon (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2</a>); but though it produced a prophet, Jeremiah, it never again produced a high priest, and therefore only the line of Eleazar, to which Ezra himself belonged, is given in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>. Thus Abiathar's misconduct and the growing fame of Jerusalem put an end to all fear of schism. We easily trace in the Psalms the increase of the nation's regard for Zion. In <a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>, written probably by David to celebrate the entry of the ark thither, it is simply "the hill of Jehovah...  his holy place." In <a href="../../par/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>. it is "his dwelling," but in <a href="../../par/psalms/20.htm">Psalm 20</a>. a higher note is struck. Zion is "the sanctuary" whence Jehovah sends "help" and "strength;" and in <a href="../../par/psalms/48.htm">Psalm 48</a>, written at a later date, Zion is found installed in the very heart of the people's love. Thus the Divine blessing rested fully upon David's work. To Jehovah's worship he gave a grand and noble centre, which from his day has had no rival, unless it be in some respects Rome. The city of David's choice has been, and continues to this hour to be, the most holy spot upon earth alike to the Jew and to the Christian, though to the latter it is so because of David's Son. At Zion, moreover, David's spiritual addition to the Mosaic ritual has given the Church its best book of devotion and the brightest part of its services; forevery hymn sung to God's glory, and every instrument of music played in God's house, is but the continuance of the prophesying with harp, psaltery, and cymbal (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-1.htm">1 Chronicles 25:1</a>), first instituted by David, though, like all that was best in David personally and in his institutions, it grew out of Samuel's influence and the practices of his schools (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-20.htm">1 Samuel 19:20</a>). Finally, the temple services were doing much to weld the discordant tribes into one nation, and would have succeeded in so doing but for the unhappy degeneracy of Solomon's latter years, and the obstinacy of his son. Yet even so, Jerusalem remains forever a memorial of the genius and piety of this extraordinary man, and the symbol of "Jerusalem the golden, the home of God's elect." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm"><title>2 Samuel 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/6.htm" title="2 Samuel 6">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 7 <a href="../2_samuel/8.htm" title="2 Samuel 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the king sat in his house.</span> The order is not chronological; for the words, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about</span> (so the Revised Version, rightly), imply the successful termination, not of all wars necessarily, but certainly of something more than that with the Philistine invaders in the Rephaim valley. A general summary of all David's wars is given in ch. 8, and it was probably after he had subdued the Philistines and Moab, and his throne was now fully established, that in some time of peace, possibly before Hanun forced him into wars which won for him an empire, David sent for Nathan, and told him his full desire. Its position here immediately after the account of the bringing of the ark to Zion has a higher unity than that of chronology. It shows that David had always a larger purpose than the mere placing of the ark in its feint; and, as soon as a period of tranquillity arrived, he confided his thoughts to the prophet. Thus, with only one step taken towards his whole plan, David exercised a wise moderation in leaving the service at Gibeon unmolested. As regards the word "rest," we have to distinguish between the first series of wars, which established David firmly on his throne, and the second series, which gave him widespread dominion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A house of cedar;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">cedars.</span> As these trees were sent by Hiram, and as the house was built, and David now settled in it, some considerable time must have elapsed since his accession. Moreover, the league with Hiram would be the result of David's successes recorded in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>; for the bond of union between the two was their mutual fear of the Philistines. As we have seen before, the alliance with Tyro had a very civilizing effect upon the Hebrews, who were far inferior to the Tyrians in the mechanical arts; and David's house of hewn cedar logs was marvellous in the eyes of a people who still dwelt chiefly in tents. David purposed to build even a more sumptuous palace for Jehovah, and advised with Nathan as his chief counsellor, and the person to whom subsequently the education of Solomon was confided. <span class="cmt_word">Within curtains;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">the curtain</span>; that is, the tent. The tabernacle prepared by Moses for the ark was formed of ten curtains (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-1.htm">Exodus 26:1</a>), but the significance lay, not in their number, but in the dwelling of Jehovah still being a mere temporary lodging, though his people had received from him a settled land. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-3.htm">2 Samuel 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for the LORD <i>is</i> with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, do all that is in thine heart.</span> Nathan rashly approves. The king's purpose seems so pious that he does not doubt its acceptance by God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The word of Jehovah came unto Nathan.</span> Not every word of a prophet was inspired, and only a very few of the prophets, and those only upon great and solemn occasions, spake under the direct influence of the Spirit of God. In his usual relations with the king, Nathan was simply a wise, thoughtful, and God-fearing man. In giving his approval he probably meant no more than that a permanent dwelling for Jehovah was what all pious men were hoping for. But from the days of Samuel to those of Ezra, there was never wanting one or even more holy men who were, on fit occasions, commissioned to bear a message from God to man; and as these generally belonged to the prophetic order, men too often now confound prophecy with prediction. So inveterate is this confusion that even in the Revised Version Amos is made to say, "I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son," whereas the Hebrew distinctly is, "I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son [that is, one trained in the prophetic schools], but I am a herdsman" (<a href="../../par/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a>). But though not a prophet by profession, yet Amos was discharging a prophet's higher duty in testifying against wickedness and impiety, and was acting under a special Divine call. Still, he did not belong to the prophetic order, nor wear the garment of black camel's hair, which was their professional dress. On the present occasion, Nathan, in approving, had spoken as a man, but now a Divine message comes to him. How we know not. but in ver. 17 it is called a "vision;" and it is also said that it came "that night." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou, etc.?</span> The question implies an answer in the negative; but there is no disapproval of David's purpose as such; but only the deferring of its full execution unto the days of his son. There is more than this. The idea which runs through the Divine message is that the dwelling of Jehovah in a tent was a fitting symbol of Israel's unquiet possession of the laud. It was David's mission to give them tranquillity and security in the region which they had conquered long ago, but wherein they had never hitherto been able to maintain their liberty unimpaired. Then, upon the accomplishment of David's special duty, his son, Shelomo, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peaceful, was to build the solid temple, as the proof that Jehovah had now taken permanent possession of the land. We find also a further thought, namely, that the building of the temple  signified "the making for David of a house." In its full significance this means that the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David were now chosen by God as the ancestors of the Messiah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">Whereas I have not dwelt in <i>any</i> house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">have walked continually</span>; that is, I have ever been a wanderer, first, in the wilderness, and subsequently at Gilgal, Shiloh, Nob, and Gibeon. Instead of a "tabernacle," the Hebrew has a "dwelling." This may refer to the houses of Abinadab and Obed-Edom, but the words more probably signify "a tent that was my dwelling." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">In all <i>the places</i> wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In all the places wherein I have walked;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">in all wherein I continued walking</span>; that is, in all my walking, in all the whole time wherein I have been a wanderer. Instead of <span class="accented">tribes</span>, the Chronicler (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a>) reads "judges," the words in the Hebrew being almost identical. "Judges" is, of course, the more easy and natural reading, but "tribes" gives a fuller sense, and is supported by all the versions. For in the troubled anarchy which lasted until Saul's reign, first one tribe and then another was called to the front, and had a temporary ascendancy; but neither did Jehovah give it any command to provide a settled place for his worship, nor did any one of the judges conceive the thought of making his tribe permanently the chief, by providing a fixed abode for the ark and for God's worship within its borders. <span class="cmt_word">To feed my people Israel.</span> The shepherd, in biblical language, is the ruler, and <span class="accented">to feed</span> is to govern, yet in a kindly way, going in front as the shepherd before his flock, to bear the brunt of danger, to clear the road, and to guide into the safe pastures. So tribe after tribe had been called to bear the brunt of war, and, after winning deliverance, it became its duty to guide and lead the people. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16, 18, 25</a>, and still more remarkably in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, we find large additions made to the account here given. It follows that we have in this place only a brief summary of the message brought by Nathan, but one containing all the chief points. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I took thee from the sheepcote.</span> There is in Nathan's message a marked advance upon the words of all previous prophecies. Hitherto God's promises had been general, and no tribe, and much less any special person, had been chosen as the progenitor of the Messiah. The nearest approach to the selection of a tribe had been the prediction of Judah's supremacy until Shiloh came (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>); but it was not even there expressly declared that Shiloh should be of Judah's race. But now David is clearly chosen. Jehovah takes him from the sheepcote; Hebrew, "the meadow" (see <a href="../../par/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>). It was in the meadows, the Naioth, round Ramah, that Samuel had gathered the young men of Israel to study their ancient records, and raise their country to a sense of its high calling. In those meadows David had been formed for his high vocation; but he had returned from them to Bethlehem, to feed his father's sheep. And now, "from following the ewes that gave suck," Jehovah takes him to be "his servant," a word of high dignity, applied to but few persons in the Old Testament. It signifies the prime minister, or vicegerent of Jehovah, as the theocratic king, and is the special title of Moses among God's people, and, among the heathen, of Nebuchadnezzar, as one summoned to do a great work for God. But it is in the last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah that the title reaches its full grandeur. For there, first of all, Israel is called Jehovah's servant, because it was Israel's office to be the witness for the oneness of God amidst the debasing polytheism of all the nations round. And then, finally, the servant is Messiah, as being the personal Representative of God upon earth. The title is now given to David as the type of Christ's kingly office, and also as the sweet singer, who added a new service to the worship of God, and made it more spiritual, and more like the service of angels round God's throne. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great <i>men</i> that <i>are</i> in the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thee a great name.</span> The widespread conquests of David, and his great empire, were not for the sake of mere earthly dominion. It was, first of all, a type of Messiah's reign, to whom God has premised the heathen for his inheritance, and that his gospel shall be carried to the ends of the earth. But, secondly, if Messiah was to be "David's Son," it was necessary that that king should hold a special place in the hearts of all Israelites. In the fables and tales of the Arabs, it is Solomon who holds the foremost place. Just as our forefathers showed the native qualities of the race by making Arthur's court the abode of prowess and chivalrous bravery; so the Arabs made Solomon's court the representative of that dazzling splendor and magnificence which they so admired; and invested him with superhuman knowledge and magical power, such as made janns and ifreets the humble slaves of his will. In the Old Testament no king is "Jehovah's servant" but David; no king is ever connected with Messiah but David. The religious fervent of the people may gather round a Hezekiah or a Josiah, and prophets may encourage them in their work; but no prophet sees in either of them the ancestor of Christ. It is, however, in the Psalms that we learn the full meaning of  Nathan's words. Here a veil is partly drawn over them. But it would be a wilful closing of the eyes to read this message and not bear in mind the clear light with which every word is illumined by the inspired outpouring of David's own heart. He thoroughly understood the fulness and blessedness of God's revelation, and has taught us that it all looked onward to Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-10.htm">2 Samuel 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover I will appoint... will plant.</span> For "moreover," the Hebrew has "and." The tenses also continue the same: "And I have appointed...  and have planted." It is all part of the same act. As regards the second verb, the past tense alone makes sense. Jehovah was not about to plant Israel in a place of their own, but had just done so completely. For David's kingdom had given them security, and with it the power of doing for God that duty which was Israel's special office in the world. Had the anarchy of the times of the judges continued, and the energies of the nation been spent in a hard struggle for existence, that rapid advance in literature which followed upon the institution of Samuel's schools, and which filled David's court with poets and chroniclers, never could have existed, and prophecy would have been impossible. The age of Hezekiah was apparently the culminating period of Hebrew civilization, after which came the depressing influences of the Assyrian invasions, and then long exile, followed by a second weary struggle for existence. If writing was at first a mystery and an art known only to priests, it became throughout the monarchy the possession especially of the prophets, who were Israel's learned men. At the head of their roll stands the matchless Isaiah, and to render it possible for his genius to display itself, not only Samuel's schools, but the security of David's era of conquest, and the long peace and magnificence of Solomon's reign, were all necessary. When "God had given David rest from his enemies round about," he had thereby finally appointed a place for Israel and had planted them there. There is, perhaps, some difficulty in the verb forms at the end of ver. 11, but none in the meaning. The reign of David marks an era in the national life. Under him Israel obtained secure possession of the place appointed for it; and now, having no longer to waste its energies in perpetual fighting, the national life grows upwards, and attains to culture, to thought, and civilization. Canaan is now their own, and instead of being mere warriors, they develop national institutions and a national character. What could men do that belongs to a higher and nobler life who were in daily fear of being swept away by Canaanites and Midianites, by Philistines and Ammonites? This miserable period is described as "beforetime," and as "since the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel." And here a colon should be placed; and the Hebrew will then proceed, "But now I have caused thee to rest from thine enemies, the anarchy and its attendant weakness is over; "and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house." Rest has been given; the establishment of David's family as the Messianic lineage is to follow (see on this promise, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">And as since the time that I commanded judges <i>to be</i> over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> The temple which Solomon was to build was the symbol of the new development of Israel, and naturally these words suggest a meaning not unworthy of so great an advance in the accomplishment of the nation's mission. Had we, indeed, only this passage, we might be content to take it in a popular sense, as signifying that, whereas Saul's throne (and subsequently that of the many usurpers in Samaria) had but a brief existence, Solomon's descendants should hold for many centuries undisputed possession of the kingdom of Jerusalem. But in <a href="../../par/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a> we read, "His (David's) seed will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven." And again in vers. 36, 37 a continuance is assured to it as lasting as that of the sun and moon. We can scarcely, therefore, be wrong in the conviction that these promises pointed onwards to the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and that the great importance attached to the building of the temple finds its explanation in its relation to him. This full establishment after so long a delay of the Mosaic typical ritual, the addition to it of psalmody, giving it a spiritual side, and making the worship that of the heart, the bestowal of empire, and the rapid development of the people under David and Solomon, were all steps in that wonderful series of special providences which made the Jews fit to be the progeniters of the Messiah, which surrounded him during his ministry with companions capable of understanding and recording his teaching, and provided for him, after his death, missionaries, not merely with zeal enough, but with intellectual gifts sufficient to enable them to persuade both Greece and Rome to listen to tidings so wonderful and mysterious as that God for our salvation had become man. Keil also well points out that the temple was a symbol of Christ's  incarnation; for it meant the dwelling of God on earth. "I have surely," says Solomon, "built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in forever" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>). The same thought was in St. John's mind when he said, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt as in a tabernacle among us" (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). For the verb used by him, literally "tabernacled," is a comparison between Christ's life on earth, and the dwelling of God in "the tent of meeting." But there is more than this. Christ himself calls his body "the temple" (<a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19, 21</a>). At the Resurrection he raised up again the temple of his body which the Jews had destroyed, and at the Ascension it was removed from the earth, to be reserved in heaven until his second advent. His reign now is spiritual, and his temple is not a building made with hands, but is the heart of the renewed believer (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). And this indwelling of Christ in the heart will continue unto the end of the present dispensation. For Christ's indwelling is that also of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>); and the gift of the Spirit continues unto the end of the world. "The Father shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever" (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be his Father, and he shall be my son.</span> Between father and son there is not only love, but oneness. Whatsoever the father hath, that belongs also to the son by natural right. But this sonship is magnified in the Psalms beyond the measure of Solomon or any natural limits. The Son there is "the Firstborn," which Solomon was not, "higher than the kings of the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>); and he must have "the nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession" (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). Psalms like the second and seventy-second belong, not to Solomon personally, but to him as the type of the prince of Peace; and they help to show us what is the true meaning and fulfilment of the words here. <span class="cmt_word">The rod of men;</span> that is, such punishment as men fitly receive for their faults. David's natural posterity was to be exempt neither from human depravity, nor from punishment, nor from the changes and chances of mortal life. With them, as with men generally, there would be a tangled skein, of virtue and sin, of folly and wisdom, of terrible fall and penitent recovery. But there was to be no blotting out of David's lineage. Great earthly houses, in the long course of events, one after another become extinct, and even the tabernacle of David was to fall (<a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>), but not forever. God would "raise up its ruins' in Christ, and "build it as in the days of old." So in <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a> there is the same thought of the complete down-hewing of David's earthly lineage, yet only to rise again to nobler life and vigour, in the Branch, or Sucker, that was to spring from the fallen trunk. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-15.htm">2 Samuel 7:15</a></div><div class="verse">But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before thee.</span> This does not refer to time, but means "in thy presence," or "before thy face," that is, "as thou hast thyself been witness." There is a strong contrast between the fate of Saul's house and this eternal endurance promised to that of David. The lineage of Saul might have made a new start in Jonathan, and even when he died at Gilboa, he left a son behind him. Still, no one ever locked upon Mephibosheth as having any title to the throne; and though Shimei (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>) may have conceived the hope that, if David were overthrown, the kingdom might return to Saul's family, yet, as a matter of fact, among the many vicissitudes of the ten tribes, the attempt never was made to search for a descendant of Saul to be Israel's king. Saul's was a royalty for one generation; David's throne was to be established forever. Not because David was sinless. His character is sullied by crimes of the darkest hue. But he never sank into a mere tyrant, such as Saul was towards David and towards the priests at Nob. Nor did David ever become an irreligious man (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>), though there is in him a strange and painful mixture of great good and great evil. The salt that preserves his character is his genuine sincerity and earnestness both towards God and man; and these qualities make him not unworthy of the high place he holds among God s people. Still, the premise was not because of David's deserts, but because from him was to come the Christ, who is blessed. forevermore.

This word does not imply that Nathan saw anything with the natural eye, but signifies that sort of prophecy which was vouchsafed to a "seer." Thus the prophecies of Isaiah, of Nahum, and of Obadiah are called "visions." Probably the word is taken from the fixed gaze, with which the seer looked into the far off world with unmoved eyes, yet seeing not with them, but with the spiritual sight within. It would thus be an intellectual process accompanied by a rigidity of the natural organs, caused partly by intensity of feeling, but chiefly by mental preoccupation, which left no faculty at liberty to discharge its ordinary function. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who <i>am</i> I, O Lord GOD? and what <i>is</i> my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David...  sat before the Lord.</span> The word "sat" is usually explained by commentators as meaning "tarried." The rabbins give the word its ordinary meaning, and say that it was the privilege of kings to pray in a sitting posture. But we cannot possibly believe that kings at this early stage had established a special etiquette for observance in prayer, and the difficulty is  merely imaginary. Because the Jews prayed standing, and we moderns pray kneeling, we both assume that to pray sitting was an irreverent act. It was not so, nor are we to think of David as sitting at ease in a chair. He sat upon the ground, as was the Oriental custom, with his feet doubled under him, and his head bent forward; and in this posture meditated upon Jehovah's message, and then poured out his thoughts. As it is expressly said that "he sat before Jehovah," the place must have been the outer court of the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Who am I, O Lord Jehovah!</span> In the Authorized Version <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> is rendered "God," because it has the vowels of the word <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; usually it is rendered "Lord," because the Masserites attached to it the vowels of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, "lord," equivalent to <span class="accented">Dominus.</span> As <span class="accented">Adonai</span> here precedes <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the Massorites were driven from their usual practice, and were so superstitious as to suppose it more reverent to pronounce the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> than that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, to which the Jews attached magical powers. David's words are not so much a prayer as a meditation, full of thanksgiving, and even of wonder at the greatness of God's mercies to him. In it he first acknowledges his own unworthiness and the meanness of his father's house compared with the high dignity which God is bestowing upon him. For not only has he raised him to the kingly office, but promised him the continuance of his house "for a great while to come." Whether David understood as yet that he was now placed in the same position as Abraham of old, in that "in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed," is uncertain, and depends upon the interpretation put upon the following words. This only we may affirm, that whet he says in this place of his house remaining until a distant future falls far short of the meaning of the passages quoted above from the Psalms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And <i>is</i> this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and this is the law of man, O Lord Jehovah.</span> In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-17.htm">1 Chronicles 17:17</a>) the Hebrew has, "And thou hast regarded me according to the law of a man of high degree." The rendering of the Authorized Version here, which, by making the clause interrogative, implies a negative, gives absolutely no sense; but some commentators render, "And this is the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah," understanding thereby that God was acting towards David in a human manner, that is, as an earthly friend and benefactor would do. But though the Revised Version favours this rendering, the Hebrew word <span class="accented">torah</span> never has this meaning, and, unless, the attempt be made to amend the text, for which the versions give no help, we must take <span class="accented">torah</span> in its usual sense, and understand that this continuance of David's house into the distant future has now become a human law, that is, a divinely constituted ordinance, which must now take its place among the laws which govern human affairs. The words are undoubtedly difficult, and we feel that David was speaking in an ejaculatory manner, in sentences but half expressed, breaking forth from him bit by bit, under the pressure of deep excitement within. We notice too that, while there is no direct reference to the Messiah in David's words, yet that the Psalms indicate that he did connect the duration of his house with the Messiah's advent; and this ejaculation may have sprung forth, if not from a fully formed conviction, yet from the feeling that the permanence of his house was for the purpose of a higher kingdom than that of Jerusalem; and so the promise was a "law of man" and the promulgation of a decree which affected the whole human race. This may be the meaning of the Vulgate, which renders "a law of Adam," that is, one embracing within its scope all Adam's race, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a></div><div class="verse">And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, Lord.

The repeated use Of this covenant and personal name of God is very emphatic; and the appeal to Jehovah's knowledge of his heart reminds us of similar outpourings of David's consciousness of his sincere devotion to his Maker, as for instance in <a href="../../par/psalms/17-3.htm">Psalm 17:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a></div><div class="verse">For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy word's sake;</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-19.htm">1 Chronicles 17:19</a> we read, "For thy servant's sake." The phrase seemed, perhaps, to the Chronicler difficult, but it does not mean "because of thy previous promise," for no such promise had been given, but "because thou hast now said it." Nor does it imply pre-existing merit in David, but that God had now chosen to declare his will, and what was according to his own heart. It thus makes God's own good will and pleasure the cause of the great honours bestowed upon David. Instead of these great things, the Hebrew has <span class="accented">this great thing</span>; that is, the lasting continuance of David's family. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-22.htm">2 Samuel 7:22</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore thou art great.</span> God's goodness is to David a proof of his greatness, and he sees it displayed, not only in his dealings with himself, but also in the past history of the Jewish nation. There is in this a depth of evangelic piety. An unconverted heart would see the greatness of God in the majesty of creation, or in severe dealings with the impenitent. David saw it in acts of mercy and kindness.  We look upon Elijah as the very type of sternness, yet he too recognized the presence of God in "the still small voice" of gentleness and love (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a></div><div class="verse">And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people, <i>even</i> like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, <i>from</i> the nations and their gods?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what one nation,</span> etc.? The translation should be, <span class="accented">And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation upon earth which God went to redeem for himself to be his people, and to make for him a name</span>, etc.? Israel both was and remains to this day a nation unique in its history, both in those early dealings of God with it, and also in its later history and its marvellous preservation unto this day. It is remarkable that in this place the word for "God," <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, is followed by a verb plural, the almost invariable rule in Hebrew being that, though <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is itself plural, it takes a verb singular whenever it refers to the true God. In the corresponding passage (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the verb is in the singular. No adequate reason has been given for this deviation, but probably the usage in these early times was not so strict as it became subsequently. It is the influence of writing, and of the eye becoming conversant with writing, that makes men correct in their use of language and in the spelling of words. In the Syriac Church, God the Word and God the Holy Ghost were at first spoken of in the feminine gender, because "Word" and "Spirit" are both feminine nouns; but grammar soon gave way to soundness of thought and feeling. So probably in colloquial language <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was often used with a verb plural, but correct thinking forbade and overruled grammar. We may regard this, then, as one of the few passages in which the colloquial usage has escaped correction, and attach no further importance to it. <span class="cmt_word">For you.</span> "You" is plural, and refers to the people. The Vulgate has "for them," which is in accordance with the greater exactness of modern grammar. But sudden changes of person are very common in Hebrew, which follows the rules of thought rather than of written composition; and so David speaks of Israel as <span class="accented">you</span>, because they seemed to him to be present. We must note, however, that in the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">for thy land, and thy people,</span> the pronoun is singular, and refers to God. <span class="cmt_word">From the nations and their gods.</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, by inserting "from," which is not in the Hebrew, take "nations" as in apposition with "Egypt;" but a moment's consideration shows that this is untenable, as "nations" is plural. But the whole verse is so full of grammatical difficulties as to make it extremely probable that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to supply the verb "to drive out," which is actually read in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, or even to substitute it in the place of "for thy land," which is omitted in the parallel passage. The nations which God drove out had nothing to do with Egypt, but were the seven dominant tribes of Canaan; and the bestowal upon Israel of their territories was as essential a part of Jehovah's dealings with his people as the Exodus itself. Thus the reading will be, <span class="accented">To drive out before thy people, whom thou purchasedst for thee from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-24.htm">2 Samuel 7:24</a></div><div class="verse">For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel <i>to be</i> a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou hast confirmed.</span> The word means "thou hast firmly and securely established Israel to "be thy people." This plainly refers to [he settlement in Canaan, now at last completed by David's victories, and not to the deliverance from Egypt. In the words that follow David recognizes the spiritual importance, not only of the permanent continuance of his house, but also of the empire given unto him. For Israel is now to be <span class="cmt_word">a people forever: and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</span> It is very necessary to retain here the personal name, Jehovah, as it is in the Hebrew, and not dilute it down to the <span class="accented">Lord</span> of the Septuagint. For now, to David's mind, the covenant seemed complete, and ratified forever. Israel is to have an everlasting existence - a promise belonging to it in its full sense only spiritually. For as long as the world lasts, it is against the spiritual Israel that the gates of hell shall never prevail. And next, first as the theocratic people, and then as the Church, it is to hold a unique relation to Jehovah, who is to be its God. For Israel, that is, the Jewish and the Christian Church, worships, not the God of nature, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, but <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the God of grace; and they learn his attributes, not from philosophy, nor by metaphysical inquiry, but from his own revealed will, in which he teaches us what he is, what we are, and how we are to become one with him.

Here it simply means "courage," as in,  <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32</a>.

As this grammatical usage, which is common to all the Semitic languages, was not understood at the time when our version was made, we find all the parts of the verb "to be" constantly printed in italics, as though absent, while really they are expressed in the Oriental way. This has the advantage, however, of reminding the reader that wherever the verb "to be" is printed in Roman characters it has a much stronger meaning than the mere union of subject and predicate. Thus in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> the first "was," in Roman type, means "existed," or possibly "became;" the second "was," in italics, is simply the copula. Here the correct translation is, <span class="accented">And now, O Lord Jehovah, thou art the God</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the one real, true God.

Thus David prays that the blessing may now at once begin to take effect. It is often rendered "please" in our version, because the verb is one used only of a determination resolved upon of the free will of the purposer.

We have in this chapter a brief summary of the wars which raised Israel from the position of a struggling and oppressed race to the possession of widespread empire. With this narrative the first history of David ends, and in the subsequent narratives many of the events referred to here are more fully detailed, and given with additional incidents. <span class="cmt_word">David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> Metheg-ammah means "the bridle of the mother city." We learn from the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>) that the city of Gath is meant by this phrase. Gath was at this time the metropolis of Philistia, and had reduced the other four chief towns to a state of vassalage. Thus by taking Gath, his old city of refuge (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>), David acquired also the supremacy which she had previously exercised over the whole country, and by placing a strong garrison there, as previously  the Philistines had done in the towns of Israel, he kept that martial race in awe. It denotes great progress in the arts of war that David could besiege and capture a town so strong as Gath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And <i>so</i> the Moabites became David's servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote Moab.</span> In the previous history we find David and Moab on such friendly terms that he entrusted his father and mother into their king's keeping (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3, 4</a>). Now he not only subjugates them, but puts two-thirds or, according to the ancient versions, half of the captured combatants to death. Compared with the custom of the Romans, and with the attempt to destroy all the males in Edom, this was mild treatment; for we find Caesar in his Gallic wars putting all his prisoners to death, and using for their execution the mere phrase, "he counted them in the number of enemies," as if the killing of enemies was a matter of course. The customs of the Israelites in war were not so cruel, and this treatment of the Moabites seems to be mentioned as showing that they received exceptionally severe treatment. The justification of this is found by Jewish commentators, on the authority of the Midrash, in the supposed fact that the King of Moab had put David's father and mother to death. But as Philippson adds, even so it was an instance of the extreme barbarity of ancient warfare. <span class="cmt_word">Casting them down to the ground;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">making them to lie down on the ground</span>; and so the Revised Version. It is plain that those who were made to lie on the ground were combatants who had been made prisoners, and the Hebrew seems to mean that, while they were thus prostrate, they were measured off into three divisions, whereof two were put to the sword, and one permitted to live. All the versions, however, understand that only half were put to death, making the sense to be that he measured them with two cords, one to kill, and one full cord - one, that is, of larger size, to save alive. We get no help from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-2.htm">1 Chronicles 18:2</a>, where this treatment of the Moabites is omitted. It is probable that it was in this war that Benaiah slew "two lion-like men of Moab" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-22.htm">1 Chronicles 11:22</a>), who were its champions and perhaps members of the royal house. <span class="cmt_word">They brought gifts</span> means that they paid an annual tribute; but the phrase shows that, though now they were <span class="cmt_word">David's servants,</span> that is, <span class="accented">subjects</span>, yet that they were left in possession of their independence, and that their internal affairs were managed by native authorities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-3.htm">2 Samuel 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hadadezer</span>. The name is spelt Hadarezer in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a> and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, and such is the reading of the versions here and of many Hebrew manuscripts. The other reading has been defended on the ground that Hadad is the name of the Syrian sun-god, but the cuneiform inscriptions show that his real name was Hadar. The King of Syria, mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, is called in Assyrian Ben-Hidri. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span>. Ewald identifies Zobah with the "Sabo" mentioned by Ptolemy. This is uncertain, but evidently Zobah lay northeast of Damascus and south of Hamath, in the region between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates. In <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> it appears as a powerless country governed by a multitude of petty kings; but evidently now Hadarezer had made himself supreme, and become a powerful monarch whose authority extended even across the river into Mesopotamia (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>). Having crushed his rivals at home, he had next endeavoured to extend his dominion abroad. <span class="cmt_word">As he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</span> The word "Euphrates" is inserted in the Authorized Version, because the margin says, "Euphrates read but not written." In the Revised Version it is omitted, because the unauthoritative nature of these directions to read something not in the text has been demonstrated. Technically these readings are called <span class="accented">K'ri</span>, and the written text <span class="accented">K'tib.</span> In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> the reading is, "as he went to stablish his dominion by the river" - a change which involves the alteration of only one letter, as the word rendered here "his border," and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> "his dominion," is the same, signifying literally, "his hand." For this reason the Revised Version renders it correctly in both places "his dominion." Now, David never had possessed up to this time any dominion upon the Euphrates, but in the fuller narrative in ch. 10. we learn that these Syrians of Zobah had sent powerful reinforcements to the Ammonites in their war with David; and he might reasonably, therefore, determine to follow up his victory over. them by extending his power up to the river, so as to guard the fords, and prevent all future invasions. And this Hadarezer would resent. As an able and enterprising man, he had succeeded in making Zobah a powerful realm, and was not likely to submit to having a bridle put upon his adventurous spirit by the posting of an Israelitish garrison on the borders. We learn from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a> that David's object was to prevent aid coming to Ammon from Zobah, and that he succeeded in putting a barrier in Hadarezer's way. We can scarcely doubt, therefore, that the reading in the Chronicles is to be preferred. In <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> we read that Saul had waged war with Zobah, and as David had probably served in it, he would have thereby acquired both a knowledge of the country, very useful in this present more serious expedition, and also have learned the necessity of guarding his dominions against perpetual invasions from that quarter.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And David took from him a thousand <i>chariots</i>, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them <i>for</i> an hundred chariots.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen.</span> The word "chariots" is inserted in the Authorized Version after "thousand," from the parallel place in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>, where also it is said that David captured seven thousand horsemen. The numbers of the Chronicler are more in proportion to one another than those mentioned here, provided we assume that the word "chariots" ought to be supplied, which, as it is not the only difference, is uncertain. Until the Arabs invented our present system of notation, the ancient methods of representing numbers were so liable to error that little dependence can be placed upon them. The Hebrews used their letters for numerals, but after 400 their system breaks down. Any number higher than 400 can be represented only by long sums in arithmetic, or by an intricate system of points above and below, which were sure to get into confusion. <span class="cmt_word">David houghed all the chariot</span> <span class="cmt_word">horses</span>. There is good reason for concluding that the word used here, <span class="accented">recheb</span>, is a collective, and signifies animals used either for riding or driving. What David reserved was not a hundred chariots, but a hundred riding horses, which would be useful to him for rapid communication, and could scarcely be regarded as a violation of the command in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>. Both the Authorized and Revised Versions are wrong, but the Authorized Version at least makes the word <span class="accented">recheb</span> have the same meaning in both clauses, whereas the Revised Version makes it signify chariot horses in the first clause, and the chariots themselves in the second. The defeat by David, with infantry only, of an army provided with so powerful a force of cavalry and chariots, proves his great military skill, and their capture hears even more emphatic testimony to his generalship. In the Psalms we find horses often referred to as objects regarded with terror, and which gave a great advantage to their enemies (<a href="../../par/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-17.htm">Psalm 33:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/76-6.htm">Psalm 76:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but over which they had triumphed by Jehovah's aid. This method, however, of rendering them useless, though practised by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a>), was most cruel; as the poor things, unable to move about with the sinews of their hind legs severed, would perish of hunger.

The inhabitants of these regions and of Mesopotamia were descended from Aram, the son of Shem (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>), and bore his name. Thus Zobah is called Aram-Zobah in the title of <a href="../../par/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>. As members of a kindred race, and speaking the same language, all the clans of the Aramean family would naturally combine to check the growing power of Israel.

This is the word used in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> and 1 Sam 13:3. The Arameans were left free to manage their internal affairs themselves, but they had to pay tribute (see on ver. 2); and to prevent the assembling of troops to contest David's authority and shake off his yoke, garrisons were stationed in such places as commanded the country. The Philistines had done the same in Israel when they were masters there. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shields of gold.</span> Probably they were plated with gold, and were borne by Hadarezer's bodyguard. But it is very uncertain whether shields are really meant. The word in Syriac means "quivers." Jerome evidently could not at first find out what it signified, as he in this place translates in the Vulgate "arms," but subsequently he became better, informed. The LXX. renders "bracelets," and adds that they were carried away from Jerusalem by Shishak in the days of Rehoboam. There is no contradiction in this with what is said in <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>, as what Solomon made were undoubtedly shields, such being the certain meaning of the word in the Hebrew, and its rendering in all the versions. No version renders the word used here "shield." In the parallel place (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-7.htm">1 Chronicles 18:7</a>) the Syriac and Vulgate render it "quivers," the LXX. "collars," and the Arabic "plates of gold hung on the trappings of the horses." As they were captured from a Syrian king, they probably retained their Syriac name, and if so they were "quivers."

Its interest in the present day lies in its having been the capital of the Hittites - a race whose very existence was doubted a few years ago, in spite of the testimony of Holy Scripture; but whose marvellous empire has been lately proved to be historical by Egyptian records on the one side, and cuneiform inscriptions on the other. Unfortunately, inscriptions which they have themselves left behind have not yet found any one capable of deciphering them. In the  <span class="date">twelfth century B.C.</span> they were the paramount power from the Euphrates to the Lebanon. For many centuries they contended with the Pharaohs  for the possession of Egypt, and while Rameses II. had to make an inglorious peace with the Kheta, as they are called, and marry the king's daughter, Rameses III won a great victory over them, and saved Egypt from thraldom. In the cuneiform inscriptions we find the record of a struggle between Assyria and the Hittites, lasting for four hundred years, during which Shalmaneser made thirty campaigns against them, but they were not finally conquered until  <span class="date">B.C. 717</span>, during the reign of Sargon. Fuller details will be found in Dr. Wright's 'Empire of the Hittites,' published by Messrs. Nisbet. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-10.htm">2 Samuel 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And <i>Joram</i> brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joram</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-10.htm">1 Chronicles 18:10</a> he is called Hadoram, and this was apparently his real name, Joram being merely the substitution of the nearest Hebrew word for something foreign and therefore unintelligible. So among the descendants of the French refugees settled in England similar changes are common. Thus Pillons becomes Pillow; Chevallier, Shoveller; St. Amour, Stammers. As Hamath bordered upon Zobah, and apparently had waged unsuccessful war with the vigorous Hadarezer, Tel was grateful to David for smiting his rival, and sent this embassy of congratulation for the purpose of ensuring the conqueror's friendship. For this end he also sent rich presents; and as a present is called in the Hebrew a <span class="accented">blessing</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>, margin), the phrase used here, to bless him, contains the idea, not only of congratulation, but of offerings. There is something admirable in this high Oriental courtesy. The material value of the gifts is left in the background. Their worth lies in their being the acknowledgment of the Divine favour resting upon David, and in the prayer that that favour may continue. In <a href="../../par/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43, 44</a> we have proof of the great pleasure which this embassy from so great a nation gave to David.

It was in this way that he accumulated those large stores of the precious metals enumerated in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29.htm">1 Chronicles 29</a>, and employed in making the sacred vessels of the temple. Their vast amount is the more remarkable because Palestine previously was almost destitute of them. Wherever the armies of Israel went, they made diligent search after everything that would serve towards the building of their sanctuary.

In the superscription of Psalm we find the wars with Aram-Naharaim (Mesopotamia) and Aram-Zobah coupled with this smiting of Edom in the valley of salt, which lay to the south of the Dead Sea, and was a fatal place to the Edomitos in their war subsequently with Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>). Such a double victory over the Arameans first, and immediately afterwards over Edom, would account for the "name," that is, the reputation, which David gained. The course of events seems to have been as follows. The Edomites, believing that David was engaged in a struggle beyond his powers with the Syrians, took the opportunity to invade Israel. But the campaign in Aram was quickly decided, and David was able to send Abishai with a detachment of his forces to repel the Edomites. On hearing of his approach, they retired before him, and, making a stand in their own territories, were defeated in the valley of salt, with the loss of eighteen thousand men (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>). In this place the victory is ascribed to David, because it was won by his general acting under his orders. For some unexplained reason, the feelings of the Israelites against Edom were very vindictive, and Joab followed with larger forces, and not only slew twelve thousand in a second battle (<a href="../../par/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>, title), but remained six months in the country, ruthlessly putting every male to death (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>). From this time the Edomites and Israelites were implacable foes, and in later Jewish literature the Jews gave vent to their intense hatred of the Roman empire by giving it the name of Edom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.

And as soon as he withdrew, the exiles would return to their old homes. To keep them, therefore, in entire subjection, the country was. held by strong garrisons, and the Edomites became David's servants, being apparently deprived for the present of any form of  independent government. We have, then, in this chapter, a brief summary of David's wars, whereby he established his supremacy ever the extensive region from Hamath on the north to the salt plains on the south of the Dead Sea, and from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David executed judgment and justice.</span> There was very little real truth in Absalom's fault finding with the administration of justice (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-3.htm">2 Samuel 15:3, 4</a>), unless we suppose - what is only too probable - that David, after his terrible crimes of murder and adultery, became lax in the discharge of his judicial duties. Here, at this period of his life, he was a zealous judge at home, as well as a brave and skilful general. He was one of those many sided characters who are great in a multitude of ways. Like Julius Caesar and our own Alfred, he was as distinguished in the arts of peace as in those of war. And thus, while his first care was for the establishment of religion, and while even the singing in the sanctuary was not beneath his notice, he also, even in the midst of dangerous wars, gave careful attention to the orderly government of his kingdom and the maintenance of right and law. We have already seen with what consummate skill he selected a capital immediately that he was made king of all Israel. Saul had done much in war. Though finally defeated at Gilboa, he had taught the Israelites their strength, and laid the foundations of David's empire; but he had done nothing to consolidate the tribes, or provide tribunals for the settlement of disputed legal rights or the punishment of crimes. Israel was as loose an aggregate of discordant atoms at his death as it was at his appointment; and the maintenance of order was left to the caprice of local sheiks. Samuel had done far more for the internal development and consolidation of the people than Saul; but it was David who made them into a nation. The continuance of his work was frustrated by the extravagance of Solomon, the folly of Rehoboam, and the ambition of the restless tribe of Ephraim; but the two parts into which his realm was broken at least held together, and there never again was danger of such anarchy and threatened disintegration as existed in the times of the judges. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a></div><div class="verse">And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <i>was</i> recorder;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab... was over the host.</span> Twice in this book we have lists of David's chief officers - here and at the end of ch. 20. The present lint belongs to the period of David's greatest prosperity, when all went well with him in peace and war, and when Jehovah had elevated him to the unique rank of Messianic king - a distinction which belonged to him personally, and was inherited by none of his successors. Between it and the second list there lies a tragic tale of sin and shame, of crime and merited punishment, of the realm rising in rebellion against the adulterous king, and of his own family breaking away from the bends of godly discipline, and giving way to licentiousness, to bloodshed, and to parricidal ambition. But probably David's character had then gained in spirituality and singleness of heart; whereas now prosperity must already have begun its work of sapping the foundations of his moral nature. Joab, who had been stripped of his command for the murder of Abner, had regained it by his bravery at the capture of Jerusalem. We have seen also that David entrusted to him the building of Jerusalem, and apparently he was prime minister in all matters except probably the king's judicial functions. <span class="cmt_word">Jehoshaphat...  was recorder;</span> literally, <span class="accented">remembrancer.</span> It was his office to reduce the king's decrees to writing, and also to see that they were carried into execution. Probably after they had been committed to writing, they were laid before the king for his approval, and, when confirmed by his hand or seal, were entered in the book of remembrance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Seraiah <i>was</i> the scribe;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zadok...  and Ahimelech... were the priests.</span> We have already seen that this was contrary to the letter of the Mosaic Law, and yet that there was no schism, and that by patience matters came back to the right groove. Zadok, of the elder line of Eleazar (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-8, 50-53</a>), was high priest at Gibeon, and Ahimelech, of the junior line of Ithamar, was the high priest at Jerusalem. Instead of <span class="accented">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>, the Syriac transposes the names, and reads, "Abiathar the son of Ahimelech" This agrees with the list in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and it is certain that Abiathar outlived David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and that he was David's high priest throughout his reign, though Zadok is not only constantly associated with him, but is placed first, as the man of higher rank (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). It is also remarkable that our Lord makes Abiathar the person who gave David the shewbread (<a href="../../par/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>), whereas in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21</a>. he is repeatedly called Ahimelech. As both the LXX. and the Vulgate support the Hebrew against the Syriac, and as the reading "Ahimelech" is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a> and 1 Chron 24:3, 6, 31, we must reject the emendation of the Syriac, and conclude that there was a double tradition respecting these names, some manuscripts making Abiathar the father, and others giving the seniority to Ahimelech. Our Lord made Abiathar the father, but the scribes, in their editing of the Hebrew text, gave that place to Ahimelech, yet did not carry out their restoration so thoroughly as not to  leave proof that the names probably ought to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah was scribe.</span> His office was similar to that of a secretary of state with us. For <span class="accented">Seraiah</span> we have <span class="accented">Shavsha</span> in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, <span class="accented">Shisha</span> in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>, and <span class="accented">Sheva</span> in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>. This illustrates what has just been said as to the uncertainty about proper names. They are always most difficult to read, as the sense gives no aid, and these various forms of a name that does not occur elsewhere really bear witness to the high antiquity of the manuscripts uses by the scribes in settling the text of the Old Testament; and also to their self-restraint in not making them all forcibly agree. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a></div><div class="verse">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was over</i> both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Cherethites and the Pelethites.</span> As we have already seen (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>), the Cherethim were an insignificant tribe inhabiting the southern part of the country of the Philistines. Nor is that place the only proof of this fact; for they are connected with the Philistines also in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a> and <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. David made their acquaintance when at Ziklag; and probably the Pelethim dwelt in the same neighbourhood, and were a still more unimportant clan or family. Much ingenuity has been expended in finding for their names a Hebrew derivation, and Gesenius explains them as meaning "cutters and runners," though for the latter signification he has to go to the Arabic, where he finds a verb <span class="accented">falata</span>, "to run away," "flee." But this craze of explaining the names of aboriginal tribes and their towns by Hebrew words is not only absurd in itself, but bars the way to sounder knowledge. For it is possible that, by the study of names not belonging to the Hebrew language, we might arrive at some correct ideas about the races who had previously occupied Palestine. Instead of this, the whole system of derivation is corrupted, and philology made ridiculous. What can be more ludicrous than to explain these Pelethim as "runners away," unless it be the notion that the Rephaim took their name from the Hebrew word for "a ghost"? In his "mighties" David had a powerful bodyguard of native Israelites, and Saul previously had formed a similar force of three thousand men, not merely for the protection of his own person, but to guard the land from marauding incursions of Amalekites and other freebooting tribes. Such a body of men was of primary importance for police purposes and the safety of the frontiers. How useful such a force would be we can well understand from the history of the marches between England and Scotland (see also note on 2 Samuel 3:22); but I imagine that the Cherethites and Pelethites were used for humbler purposes. While "the mighties" guarded the frontiers, and kept the peace of the kingdom, these men would be used about the court and in Jerusalem, to execute the commands of the king and his great officers. Native Israelites would refuse such servile work, and the conquered Canaanites might become dangerous if trained and armed; while these foreigners, like the Swiss Guard in France, would be trustworthy and efficient. As for the true-born Israelites, they probably did not form the mass of the population, but, like the Franks in France, were the privileged and dominant race. We read that even from Egypt, besides their own dependents, there went up with Israel "a great mixture" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>, margin). In <a href="../../par/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a> these are even contemptuously designated by a word which answers to our "omnium gatherum;" yet even they, after the conquest of Palestine, would be higher in rank than the subjugated Canaanites, from whom, together with another "mixed multitude" spoken of in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>, are descended the felahin of the present day. David's armies would be drawn from the Israelites, among whom were now reckoned the mixed multitude which went up from Egypt, and which was ennobled by taking part in the conquest of Canaan. In the army "the mighties" would hold the chief place; while the mercenaries, recruited from Ziklag and its neighbourhood, which continued to be David's private property (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), would be most useful in the discharge of all kinds of administrative duty, and would also guard the king's person. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a> for <span class="accented">Cherethi</span> we find <span class="accented">Cheri</span>, which word also occurs in <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>. In the former passage the spelling is a mistake, the letter <span class="accented">t</span> having dropped out, and it is so regarded by the Jews, who read "Cherethi." The versions also translate there just as they do here, namely the Vulgate and LXX., "Cherethi and Pelethi;" and the Syriac by two nouns of somewhat similar sound to the Hebrew, and which signify "freemen and soldiers." In the latter place in Kings it is probable that some other tribe supplied the bodyguard in Queen Athaliah's time. <span class="cmt_word">David's sons were chief rulers;</span> Hebrew and Revised Version, <span class="accented">priests</span>. Similarly, in ch. 20:26, "Ira the Jairite was David's priest," Hebrew, <span class="accented">cohen</span>; and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, "Zabud was Solomon's priest." Gesenius and others suppose that they were domestic chaplains, not ministering according to the Levitical law, but invested with a sort of sacerdotal sacredness in honour of their birth. But if we look again at <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a> we find "Zabud was priest, the king's friend;" and the latter words seem to be an explanation of the title <span class="accented">cohen</span>, added because the word in this sense was already becoming obsolete.  In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a> the language is completely changed, and we read, "and David's sons were chief at the king's hand." We may feel sure that the Chronicler knew what was the meaning of the phrase in the Books of Samuel, and that he was also aware that it had gone out of use, and therefore gave instead the right sense. Evidently the word cohen had at first a wider significance, and meant a "minister and confidant." He was the officer who stood next to his master, and knew his purpose and saw to its execution. And this was the meaning of the term when applied to the confidential minister of Jehovah, whose duty it was to execute his will according to the commands given in the Law; but when so used it gradually became too sacred for ordinary employment. Still, there is a divinity about a king, and so his confidants and the officers nearest to his person were still called cohens; and we find the phrase lingering on for another century and a half. For Jehu puts to death, not only Ahab's great men and kinsfolk, but also "his cohens," the men who had been his intimate friends (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_samuel/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Samuel 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_samuel/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Samuel 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm"><title>2 Samuel 9 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_samuel/9.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_samuel/9.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_samuel/9-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_samuel/8.htm" title="2 Samuel 8">&#9668;</a> 2 Samuel 9 <a href="../2_samuel/10.htm" title="2 Samuel 10">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1</a></div><div class="verse">And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul?</span> As Mephibosheth was five years old at his father's death (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>), but now had a son (ver. 12), a sufficient time must have elapsed for him to grow up and marry; so that probably the events of this chapter occurred seventeen or eighteen years after the battle of Gilboa. As David was king at Hebron for seven years and a half, he had been king now of all Israel for about nine years. But during this long period he had been engaged in a weary struggle, which had left him little repose, and during which it might have been dangerous to draw the house of Saul out of obscurity. But he was at last firmly established on the throne, and had peace all around; and the time was come to act upon the promise made to Jonathan (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14, 15</a>), and which we may be sure David had never forgotten. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-2.htm">2 Samuel 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>there was</i> of the house of Saul a servant whose name <i>was</i> Ziba.

It then became the title of the Phoenician sun god; and Jezebel's shameless worship of this deity, and her cruelty to Jehovah's prophets, made the people henceforth change the name Baal into Bosheth, "the shameful thing" (see note on 2 Samuel 2:8). Mephibosheth had not changed his name, but had lived in obscurity in the wild region beyond Mahanaim. Meanwhile Ziba had probably taken care of Saul's property in the tribe of Benjamin. There is no reason to doubt that he had been steward there for Saul, and after his master's death had continued in possession of the estate. David, we may feel sure, would not interfere with it, and Ziba would hold it for Saul's heirs, who could not themselves take possession. To him David now sends, not because he expected to hear of a son of his dear friend Jonathan, but because he was ready to show kindness to any representative of the fallen monarch. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said, <i>Is</i> there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him?

The devout mind of the Orientals saw in everything that was more than common a manifestation of God, and thus the epithet "of God" came to be applied to anything that was very great (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a>, margin; Genesis 35:5; <a href="../../par/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, margin).

Of Lo-debar nothing is known, but it must have been east of the Jordan, near Mahanaim. Of Ammiel we read again in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, where we find that he was a man of wealth, who helped to supply the wants of David and his men during the rebellion of Absalom. Possibly this kindness of David towards one for whom he had feelings of loyalty, as representing a royal house to which he had remained faithful, won his heart. There was a magnanimity about it which would commend it to a man who was himself generous and true. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-5.htm">2 Samuel 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</div><div class="comm">

Subsequently in Israel each new line of usurpers put to death every male relative of its predecessor, and it was with difficulty in Judah that one babe was rescued from the hands of its own grandmother, Athaliah, when she usurped the throne. Looked at, then, in the light of Oriental policy, David's conduct was most generous.

There seems, nevertheless, to have been on Ziba's part a grudge against Mephibosheth for thus getting back from the king what he had hoped to keep as his own. The privilege of being the king's friend, and eating at his table, was an honour that would be more highly prized than even the possession of the estates.

When in the East  your entertainer assures you that everything he has to his last dirhem is yours, he nevertheless expects you to pay twice the value foreverything you consume; but he makes his exaction pleasant by his extreme courtliness. So Ephron offered his cave at Machpelah to Abraham as a free gift, but he took care to obtain for it an exorbitant price (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-11.htm">Genesis 23:11, 15</a>). Mephibosheth described himself in terms similar to those used by David of himself to Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a>); but he meant no more than to express great gratitude, and also to acknowledge the disparity of rank between him and the king. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_samuel/9-9.htm">2 Samuel 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy master's son.</span> Strictly Mephibosheth was Saul's grandson, but words of relationship are used in a very general way in Hebrew.

Though Mephibosheth ate at the king's table, he would have a household to maintain - for he had a wife and son - and other expenses; and his having "food to eat" includes everything necessary, as does our prayer for "daily bread." He would live at Jerusalem as a nobleman and Ziba would cultivate his estates, paying, as is usual in the East, a fixed proportion of the value of the produce to his master. <span class="cmt_word">Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants</span> (slaves). He had evidently thriven; for, beginning as a slave in Saul's household, he had now several wives and many slaves of his own, and had become a person of considerable importance. He would still remain so, though somewhat shorn both of wealth and dignity in becoming only Mephibosheth's farmer.

The text is probably corrupt, as it requires the insertion of some such phrase as the "said the king" of the Authorized Version to make it intelligible. Of the many emendations proposed, the most probable is that of the LXX. and Syriac, which make this clause an observation of the historian pointing out the high honour done to Mephibosheth in placing him on an equality with David's own sons. It would then run as follows: So <span class="accented">Mephibosheth ate at the king's table as one of the king's sons.</span>
