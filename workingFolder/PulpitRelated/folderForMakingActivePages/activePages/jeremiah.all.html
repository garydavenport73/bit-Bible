Diodorus Siculus remarks 2:30) - and his statement is fully confirmed by the Babylonian cuneiform tablets - that "the appearance of comets, eclipses of the sun and moon, earthquakes, and in fact every kind of change occasioned by the atmosphere, whether good or bad, both to nations and to kings and private individuals [were omens of future events]." A catalogue of the seventy standard astrological tablets is to be found in the third volume of the British Museum collection of inscriptions. Among the items we read, "A collection of twenty-five tablets of the signs of heaven and earth, according to their good presage and their bad;" and again, "Tablets [regarding] the signs of the heaven, along with the star (comet) which has a corona in front and a tail behind; the appearance of the sky," etc. There can hardly be a doubt that the prophetic writer had such pseudo-science as this in his eye (see Professor Sayce, 'The Astronomy and Astrology of the Baby. Ionians, with translations of the tablets,' ere, in the <span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:145-339).

"People" should, as usual, be corrected into <span class="accented">peoples</span> - the heathen nations are referred to. The Hebrew has "the statutes;" but the Authorized Version is substantially right, customs having a force as of iron in Eastern countries. It seems to be implied that the "customs" are of religious origin (setup. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-8.htm">2 Kings 17:8</a>, where "the statutes of the heathen" are obviously the rites and customs of polytheism. <span class="cmt_word">For one cutteth a tree</span>, etc. This is intended to prove the foregoing statement of the "vanity," or groundlessness, of idolatry. The order of the Hebrew, however, is more forcible, for <span class="accented">as wood out of the forest one cutteth it</span>, <span class="accented">viz</span>. the idol.

The close resemblance of this verse to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>, will strike every reader.

This is the interpretation given to our passage in Ver. 70 of the apocryphal Epistle o! Jeremiah (written in the Maccabean period, evidently with reference to our prophecy), and is much more striking than the rival translation, "like a palm tree of turned work," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. stiff, immovable (comp. Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:110, 111; Horace, 'Sat.,' 1. 8, 1-4). <span class="cmt_word">They must needs be borne...  they cannot do evil</span>; a reminiscence, apparently, of <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-7.htm">Isaiah 46:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>.

There is none like unto thee; none, that is, among those who claim to have Divine power (comp. the phrase, "God of gods," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-2.htm">Psalm 136:2</a>). It would appear from some passages, however, as if the heathen did not worship mere nonentities (though idols are sometimes called "things of naught," <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ten times by Isaiah) by comparison with Jehovah, but that there was a dark background of awful personal or quasi-personal reality (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>).

As time went on, the sacred writers became more and more distinct in their assertions of the truth that Jehovah, the Self-revealing God, is not Israel's King only, but also of the world (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-28.htm">Psalm 22:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/96-10.htm">Psalm 96:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To thee doth it appertain</span>; viz. that men should fear thee. Forasmuch as, etc. (see above, on Ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">Among all the wise men</span>. "Men" is supplied, but doubtless rightly. It is a contest - how unequal a one! - between Jehovah and the sages of the heathen (comp. "Yet he also is wise," <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-2.htm">Isaiah 31:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock <i>is</i> a doctrine of vanities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brutish and foolish</span>. In fact, the original meaning of the idolatrous religions had begun, probably, to fade, and the worship of Bel and Nebo had become (as the worship of the Egyptian gods became at a later period) increasingly formal and ritualistic. T<span class="cmt_word">he stock is a doctrine of vanities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">an instruction of vanities</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all that the idols can teach is vanities. Against this is the plural ("vanities," not vanity); it is more natural (and also more in accordance with usage; comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-26.htm">Genesis 41:26</a>, Hebrew) to render, <span class="accented">the instruction of the vanities is wooden</span> ("vanities" has the constant technical sense of "idols;" see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-22.htm">Jeremiah 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-6.htm">Psalm 31:6</a>). The clause then furnishes a reason for the folly of the heathen; how should they attain to more than a "wooden" knowledge, when the idols themselves are but wood? A bitter truth in an ironical form. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple <i>is</i> their clothing: they <i>are</i> all the work of cunning <i>men</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - This verse apparently once followed Ver. 5. Like Vers. 7 and 8, it is omitted in the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">Silver spread into plates</span>, etc. The silver and gold were meant for the coating of the wooden image (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-22.htm">Isaiah 30:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Tartessus, in south-west Spain, between the two mouths of the Baetis, or Guadal-quivir. <span class="cmt_word">Gold from Uphaz</span>. A place bearing this name, or anything like it, is not known from other sources than the Old Testament writings; and hence a corruption of the text has naturally been suspected (Ophir into Uphaz). As, however, r and z are not easily confounded, either in the earlier or the later Hebrew characters, this view must be abandoned, though it has the authority of several ancient versions of this passage (including the Peshite and the Targum). The name occurs again in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>. The Peshite, moreover, curiously enough, translates <span class="accented">zahab mufaz</span> in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a> (Authorized Version, "the best gold") by "gold from Ophir." <span class="cmt_word">Blue and purple</span>. The Hebrew has no word, strictly speaking, for either "blue" or "purple." Both these words here used probably express coloring matter rather than colors (this is certain of the latter word, which properly designates a kind of mussel, the shell of which yielded dye). The first produced a violet purple, the second a reddish purple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">But the LORD <i>is</i> the true God, he <i>is</i> the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The true God</span>; literally, a God in truth, the accusative of apposition being chosen instead of the usual genitive construction, to emphasize the idea of "truth."

Whether it is a fragment of a Targum (or Chaldee paraphrase) representing a Hebrew verse really written by Jeremiah, or whether it is a marginal note by some scribe or reader which has found its way by accident into the text, cannot be positively determined. What is certain is that it is not in its right place, though it already stood here when the Septuagint Version of Jeremiah was made. To argue, with the 'Speaker's Commentary,' that the latter circumstance is decisive of the correctness of the passage in its present position, implies a view of the unchangeableness of the text in the early centuries which few leading scholars will admit.

God's "voice" is the thunder (<a href="../../par/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>), which is accompanied by the gathering of heavy clouds ("His pavilion round about him," <a href="../../par/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He causeth the vapors to ascend,</span> etc.; the storm-clouds coming up more and more thickly from the horizon. From this point the verse agrees with <a href="../../par/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a> (the psalm is full of such reminiscences, and is obviously very late). <span class="cmt_word">Lightning's with rain;</span> rather, <span class="accented">for the</span> rain. The lightning's are, as it were, the heralds or attendants of the rain. <span class="cmt_word">The wind out of his treasures</span>; a noble figure, used elsewhere of the snow and hail (<a href="../../par/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>), and of the waters of the sea (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-7.htm">Psalm 33:7</a>).

Jehovah. The phrase appears to have been coined at a lower level of religion, when every nation was supposed to have its own patron deity; just as the prophet says, ironically, to the fetish-worshippers of Israel, "Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>), and Moses, in Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), speaks of the host of heaven as having been "divided [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. assigned] unto all nations under the whole heaven." But, of course, the phrase is susceptible of a high, spiritual application (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/16-5.htm">Psalm 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/142-5.htm">Psalm 142:5</a>). God's people are, by their very conception, an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span>, chosen out by God, and choosing him, and not the world, for their portion.

How much more forcible is the original phrase: "... of the whole," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the universe!

Here, after describing dramatically the departure of the latter into exile, the prophet reports a distinct revelation of the same fact, so that this can no longer be assumed to be mere imaginative rhetoric.

Jeremiah and the people, each is, in a sense, the speaker; but here the prophetic faith seems to run rather in advance of that of his fellow-countrymen. They form, however, a fitting sequel to the charges brought against the people in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9.htm">Jeremiah 9</a>. The speaker admits that he (either the People of Judah personified, or Jeremiah as a representative of its best portion) fully deserves chastisement for having attempted to go his own way (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). He has now attained an insight into the truth that man's duty is simply to walk in the path which God has marked out for him. He only asks that Jehovah would chastise him <span class="cmt_word">with judgment</span>, or,, more clearly, <span class="accented">according to what is just</span>.

To whom is this addressed? To Jeremiah and his disciples. The Septuagint, indeed, followed by Hitzig and Graf, read (instead of "speak ye"), "Thou shalt speak unto them," adopting one different vowel-point. But this involves an inconsistency with the first verb, and is not at all necessary, for why should we suppose Jeremiah to have been completely isolated? If the prophet had well-wishers even among the princes, it stands to reason that he must have had more pronounced adherents in the classes less influenced by the prejudices of society.

The rendering "covenant," however, is not so much erroneous as unsuitable in this context; it is a secondary meaning of the Hebrew <span class="accented">b'rith</span>, the original sense being rather "authoritative appointment" (from <span class="accented">barah</span>, to cut, hence to decide). Nothing, perhaps, is so injurious to a correct understanding of the Scriptures as persistently rendering a Hebrew or Greek word by the same supposed equivalent. "Covenant" is no doubt appropriate in some passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>), because an "appointment" between men, if equals, involves "giving and taking;" but is inadequate when the parties are not equals, and most of all when the superior party is the Divine Being. In these cases we must clearly recur to the original meaning of" appointment" or "ordinance;" and we have one such case here (see also <a href="../../par/hosea/6-7.htm">Hosea 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/105-10.htm">Psalm 105:10</a>; but <span class="accented">not</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> (1, an arrangement; 2, a will or testament; 3, a covenant) is to some extent parallel (see Cremer's 'Biblico-Theological Lexicon of New Testament Greek,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.).

Others render, "read aloud" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>, Hebrew); but Jeremiah receives the direction to "proclaim" or "cry" elsewhere (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, etc.).

The language is figurative. Jehovah is the King of Israel; to commit sin is "to rebel against" him (Authorized Version sometimes weakens this into "transgress'); and to encourage one another in wickedness is "to conspire against" God.

The name Baal is changed, to mark the abhorrence of the speaker, into Bosheth (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a>).

The four most ancient versions, and some of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, read "in the time of their trouble" (as in Ver. 12). The confusion between the  two readings is easy, and the reading of the versions is to be preferred. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-15.htm">Jeremiah 11:15</a></div><div class="verse">What hath my beloved to do in mine house, <i>seeing</i> she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hath my beloved to do in mine house</span>? "My beloved" is evidently the Jewish people, who in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> is called "the dearly beloved of my soul." The Divine Speaker expresses surprise that one who has now so poor a claim to the title of "my beloved" should appear in his holy house. It is spoken in the spirit of that earlier revelation of Isaiah, "When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-12.htm">Isaiah 1:12</a>).  The Jews, it would seem, came to the temple to pray, but their prayer is not accepted, because it is associated with unholy practices. They thought by formal prayers and sacrifices to pay off their debt to the Deity, and so be free to go on with their old devices (as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-15.htm">Jeremiah 7:15</a>). This seems the best view of the difficult words which follow, but it implies a correction of the certainly ungrammatical rendering of the Authorized Version - <span class="cmt_word">seeing she hath wrought lewdness</span>  - into <span class="accented">to work the wicked device</span>. But here begins the most obscure part of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">With many</span> cannot be right; for "with" has nothing corresponding to it in the Hebrew; the word in the original simply means "the many," and as it is immediately followed by a noun in the singular with "and," and a verb in the plural, it is plain that it must (if correctly read) be part of the subject of the latter. The Septuagint, however, has a different reading, which may very well be correct, and out of which the received Hebrew reading may easily have grown - "Can vows and holy [i.e. hallowed] flesh remove from thee thy wickedness [or perhaps, 'thy calamity']?" The connection thus becomes easy. "Vows and holy flesh" (i.e. the flesh of sacrifices, <a href="../../par/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), naturally go together; the only other possible way of taking the passage (assuming the correctness of the 'received text) - " the great ones and the holy flesh shall pass away from thee" - is obviously inadmissible. "Vows and sacrifices," however, precisely express the true association of ideas. A man made a vow, and he generally paid it in the form of a sacrifice. But, inquires Jehovah, "Can such vows and such Victims please God, and expiate thy wickedness [or, 'avert thy calamity']? <span class="accented">Then thou mightest rejoice</span>." The latter words are not, indeed, more exact than those of the Authorized Version, but are in accordance with grammar, and suit the preceding question. It is not certain, however, that the text is right here; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x1fc3;</span>. (Notice that Keil, conservative to a fault in matters affecting the received text, agrees with the above correction, which is also adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and Graf.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-16.htm">Jeremiah 11:16</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, <i>and</i> of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A green olive tree</span>. The olive tree is "one of the most thriving, hardy, and productive trees in the East" (it was the first tree elected king in the parable, <a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>), and with its "foliage of a deep, perennial green," furnishes a striking symbol of healthful beauty. A psalmist, speaking in the character of the typical righteous man, compares himself to a "green olive tree in the house of God' (<a href="../../par/psalms/52-8.htm">Psalm 52:8</a>). The word rendered "green "is one of those which are the despair of translators (see on Jeremiah 2:20). It gives a picture in itself. We seem to see a flourishing, sappy tree, with abundance of pliant, gracefully moving, perennially green branches. <span class="cmt_word">With the noise of a great tumult.</span> Either the tumult of the <span class="accented">melee</span> of battle is meant (the same uncommon word is used with such a reference in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>) or the crashing of thunder.

(For the concluding figure, comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">He hath kindled fire</span>, etc. There is no occasion to explain this as merely the perfect of prophetic certitude. It was literally true that the fire of war had already devastated the fairest portion of the Holy Land. Israel (expressly referred to in Ver. 17) had already been carried into captivity, and Judah was, to the prophetic eye, as good as destroyed.

Jeremiah says that he was as unsuspicious as a tame lamb which has grown up with its master's family (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-3.htm">2 Samuel 12:3</a>). The Arabs use the very same adjective in a slightly different form as an epithet of such tame lambs (Bochart, 'Hierozoicon,' 1:520-522, edit. 1663). It is impossible to help thinking of that "Servant of Jehovah," of whom Jeremiah was a type, who is said, in prophetic vision, to have been "brought as a lamb to the slaughter," and "not to have opened his mouth "(<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tree with the fruit thereof</span>; apparently a proverbial expression. Giving the words their ordinary meaning, the rendering would <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">the tree with its bread</span> (<span class="accented">b'lakhmo</span>). Our translators appear to have thought that the transition from "bread" to "fruit" was as justifiable in Hebrew as it is in Arabic (in which '<span class="accented">uklu</span> means properly "food" in general, but also "date fruit"). Fruit, however, was not such an important article of food with the Israelites as with the Arabs; and we must either, with Hitzig, suppose a letter to have intruded into the text, and render (from a corrected reading <span class="accented">b'lekho</span>), <span class="accented">with its sap</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>, Hebrew), or else appeal to the etymology of <span class="accented">lekhem</span> (commonly "bread"), which is "firm, consistent," and render, the <span class="accented">tree with its pith</span> (Hence <span class="accented">lahmu</span> in Arabic means "flesh," and <span class="accented">luhmatu</span>, "a woof").

The key to it is in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1, 2</a>, where it is related that, after Jehoiakim's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, "Jehovah sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it." The prophecy falls into two strophes or sections, Vers. 7-13 and Vers. 14-17. In the first we have a complaint of the desolation produced by the guerilla warfare; in the second, a prediction of the captivity of the hostile peoples, not, however, without a prospect of their return home and conversion to Jehovah. It is evident enough that this passage stands in no connection with what precedes. The whole tone is that of a description of present scenes and not of the future. Sometimes, no doubt, a prophet, in the confidence of faith, represents the future as though it were already past; but there is always something in the context to determine the reference and prevent ambiguity. Here, however, there is nothing to indicate that the description relates to the future; and it is followed by a prediction which presupposes that the preceding passage refers to the literal past. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have forsaken mine house</span>. The "house" is here not the temple, but the people of Israel, as the parallel clause shows (see <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>, and setup. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>).

Bonomi ('Nineveh and her Palaces,' p. 191) has an engraving from the monuments of guests at a banquet, holding their drinking-vessels in the deeply hollowed palm of their hand. So here the people of Israel, in her weak, fainting state, needs only to be held in the quiet pressure of the palm of the hand. The remark and the illustration are due to Dr. Payne Smith.

Are birds of prey round about her?</span> The passage is difficult, but the following seems the most plausible explanation: - Jehovah is represented as surprised to see his chosen people a prey to the heathen (a strongly anthropomorphic description, as if Jehovah had not anticipated that his "giving up" his people would have such sad results). It seems to him (adopting human modes of speech) as if Israel were "a colored bird of prey," the bright plumage of which excites the animosity of its less brilliant comrades, who gather round it and pull it to pieces. It is an allusion to the phenomenon, well-known to the ancients (Tacit., 'Ann.' 6:28; Suet., 'Caes.,' 81; Plin.,' Hist. Nat.,' 10:19), of birds gathering round and attacking a strange-looking bird appearing in their midst. The prophet might have simply said "a bird;" why does he say "a bird of prey ('<span class="accented">ayit</span>)"? Probably because he has just described the hostile attitude of Israel towards Jehovah under the figure of a lion. Some particular, rare kind of vulture seems to be intended. Sennacherib apparently uses a cognate word ('it) for the vulture ('Taylor Cylinder,' 3. 68). Bochart and Gesenius, following the Septuagint, think "hyena," and not "bird of prey," is the right rendering in the first clause; but Gesenius does not offer any other passage for the meaning <span class="accented">bestia</span> <span class="accented">rapax</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field</span>. There is a parallel passage in <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-9.htm">Isaiah 56:9</a>, where, as here, the "beasts of the field (<span class="accented">i.e. the wild</span> beasts of the open country) are the heathen powers employed as God's instruments for chastising Israel (comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>, where the same figure occurs). "The prophet adopts the strongest way of expressing that Israel, utterly bereft of his natural defenders, lies at the mercy of the great heathen empire" (note on Isaiah 56:9). <span class="cmt_word">Come to devour</span>; rather, <span class="accented">bring them to devour</span>.

The favorite way of representing Jehovah's relation to his people is that of a vine-proprietor to his vineyard (see on Jeremiah 2:21). How would a vineyard be ruined if a band of shepherds were to drive their flocks among the tender vine-shoots! <span class="cmt_word">The many pastors</span> (or, <span class="accented">shepherds</span>) are clearly Nebuchadnezzar and his generals (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-3.htm">Jeremiah 6:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My pleasant portion</span>.

In the case of Judah, however, to be "plucked out" is a mercy as well as a judgment, considering who they are "out of" whose "midst" the Jews are "plucked."

"Girdle" is one of the meanings of the Hebrew ('<span class="accented">ezor</span>), but is here unsuitable. As Ver. 11 shows, it is an inner garment that is meant, one that "cleaveth to the loins of a man" (in fact, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of the Septuagint, the <span class="accented">lumbare</span> of the Vulgate). The corresponding Arabic word, '<span class="accented">izar</span>, has, according to Lane, the meaning of "waist-wrapper.' Israel was to Jehovah in as close a relation spiritually as that in which the inner garment referred to is to him who wears it materially. There is an Arabic proverb which well illustrates this: "He is to me in place of an '<span class="accented">izar"</span> (Freytag, 'Studium der Arab. Spraohe,' p. 298). "A linen apron" may perhaps be specified, because linen was the material of the priestly dress (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4</a>), and Israel was to be spiritually" a kingdom of priests." But this is not absolutely necessary. The common man used linen in his dress as well as the priest; the only difference between them was that the priest was confined to linen garments. But an ,' apron" would in any case naturally be made of linen. <span class="cmt_word">Linen</span>; literally, flax (a product of Judah, <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Put it not in water</span>. The object of the prohibition is well stated by St. Jerome. It was at once to symbolize the character of the people of Israel, stiff and impure, like unwashed linen, and to suggest the fate in store for it (Ver. 9).

A long interval elapses, and he is commanded to make a second journey to the same place, and fetch away the apron. What does this <span class="accented">P'rath</span> mean? It is by no means easy to decide. Hardly "the Euphrates," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the common prefix, "the river," is wanting, though in so extraordinary a narrative it was peculiarly needed; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> because of the length of the journey to Babylonia, which has ex hyp. to be made twice; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> because the Euphrates is not a rocky river. Ewald suggested that "some wet place near Jerusalem" probably had the name of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, and indicates a valley and spring called Forah, about six English miles north-east of Jerusalem. Mr. Birch appears to have hit independently on the same spot, which he identifies with the Parah of <a href="../../par/joshua/18-23.htm">Joshua 18:23</a>, about three miles north-east of Anatbeth, and describes as a picturesque gorge between savage rocks, with a copious stream (<span class="accented">Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, October, 1880, p. 236). This combination, however, involves an emendation of the text (<span class="accented">P'rath</span> into <span class="accented">Parah</span>) <span class="accented">- logically</span> it involves this, as Mr. Birch has seen; Ewald's comparison of the Arabic <span class="accented">furat</span>, sweet water, seems inconsistent with his reference to Parah - for which there does not seem to be sufficient necessity; and it is better to adopt the view of the great old French Protestant scholar, Bochart, that <span class="accented">P'rath</span> is a shortened form of Ephrath, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at once Bethlehem and the district in which Bethlehem lay (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>). It need hardly be said that the limestone hills of this region afforded abundance of secluded rocks. There may, of course, be at the same time an allusion to the ordinary meaning of <span class="accented">P'rath</span>, viz. Euphrates, on the analogy of the allusion in <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>. Those who hold the view here rejected, that <span class="accented">P'rath is</span> equivalent to the Euphrates, sometimes suppose that the narrative is a parable or symbolical fiction, such as Luther, Calvin, and others find in <a href="../../par/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1, 3</a>, the thing signified being in this case the carrying captive of the people to Babylon; and this seems the best way of making this interpretation plausible.

It will be noticed that, except in two cases, the names of the mothers of the reigning kings of Judah are scrupulously mentioned in the Books of Kings. This and the title of "mistress" are indications of the high rank they enjoyed in the social system. In the case of Asa, we are told that he removed his mother, Maachah, from her position as "mistress," or queen-mother, on account of her idolatry (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The political value of the station is strikingly shown by the ease with which Athaliah, as queen-mother, usurped the supreme authority (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>.). From an historical point of view, the "queen-mother" of the Jews is a most interesting personage; she is a relic of the primitive age in which relationship was reckoned with regard to the mother (so with the Accadians, Etruseans, Finns, etc.). It should be added, however, that once (viz. <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-19.htm">1 Kings 11:19</a>) the same title, "mistress," is applied to the queen-consort. <span class="cmt_word">Humble yourselves, sit down</span>; rather, <span class="accented">sit down in abase</span>-sent; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> take the station suitable for your abased circumstances (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Your principalities</span>; rather, <span class="accented">your</span> <span class="accented">head</span>. <span class="accented">ornaments</span>.

The particle of comparison has given much occupation to the commentators (see Payne Smith's note), but the above view is at once simple and suitable to the context; for Jeremiah has already admitted that "our backslidings are multiplied" (Ver. 7). <span class="accented">The Lord doth not</span>, <span class="accented">etc</span>.

When the iniquity is fully ripe, it as it were attracts the punishment, which till then is laid up in store (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-5.htm">Isaiah 18:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>).

The word is very forcible; it is the shriek in which an unsophisticated man gives vent to his pain and grief. <span class="cmt_word">An oblation</span>. It is the vegetable offering (Authorized Version, "meat offering;" Luther, "speisopfer") which is referred to in the so-called <span class="accented">minkhah</span> (literally, <span class="accented">gift</span>). Though sometimes offered separately, it regularly accompanied a burnt offering. <span class="cmt_word">I will not accept them</span>. Dr. Payne Smith tries to soften the rejection of these worshippers by the remark that "there is a time when the most genuine repentance avails nothing to avert the temporal consequences of sin." But the analogy of other similar passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>) warrants the view of Keil that the ground of the rejection of the worship is its heartless formalism and insincerity, which was equally a bar to Jehovah's favor and the prophet's intercession.

The greater part of the prophetic order had not kept pace with its more spiritual members (Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). They still traded on those natural gifts of divination (<a href="../../par/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>) which were, no doubt, where genuine, of Divine origin, but which, even then, needed to be supplemented and controlled by a special impulse from the Spirit of holiness. Jeremiah, however, declares, on the authority of a revelation, that these prophets did not divine by any God-given faculty, but "the deceit of their own heart" (Ver. 14). The Deuteronomic <span class="accented">Torah</span>, discovered after a period of concealment at the outset of Jeremiah's ministry, energetically forbids the practice of the art of divination (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>).

It is possible that the editor of Jeremiah's prophecies thought the paragraph which begins here needed something to link it with the preceding passage, and selected his formula rather unsuitably. <span class="cmt_word">Let mine eyes run down</span>, etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>).

The shame of childlessness is repeatedly referred to (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-12.htm">Jeremiah 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-4.htm">Isaiah 54:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1, 23</a>).

They describe some deeply pathetic moment of the prophet's inner life, and in all probability belong to a later period of the history of Judah. At any rate, the appreciation of the next chapter will be facilitated by reading it in close connection with Ver. 9 of the present chapter. But the section before us is too impressive to be east adrift without an attempt to find a place for it in the life of the prophet. The attempt has been made with some plausibility by a Jewish scholar, Dr. Gratz, who considers the background of these verses to be the sojourn of Jeremiah at Ramah, referred to in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>, and groups them, therefore, with another prophecy (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>), in which Ramah is mentioned by name as the temporary abode of the Jewish captives. We are told in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4, 5</a>, that Jeremiah had the choice given him of either going to Babylon with the exiles, or dwelling with the Jews who were allowed to remain under Gedaliah the governor. He chose, as the narrative in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40.htm">Jeremiah 40</a>. tells us, to stay with Gedaliah; but the narrative could not, in accordance with the reserve which characterizes the inspired writers, reveal the state of mind in which this difficult choice was made. This omission is supplied in the paragraph before us. Jeremiah, with that lyric tendency peculiar to him among the prophets, gives a vent to his emotion in these impassioned verses. He tells his friends that the resolution to go to Gedaliah may cost him a severe struggle. He longs for rest, and in Babylon he would have more chance of a quiet life than among the turbulent Jews at home. But he has looked up to God for guidance, and, however painful to the flesh, God's will must be obeyed. He gives us the substance of the revelation which he received. The Divine counselor points out that he has already interposed in the most striking manner for Jeremiah, and declares that if he will devote himself to the Jews under Gedaliah, a new and fruitful field will be open to him, in which, moreover, by Divine appointment, no harm can happen to him. Whether this is really the background of the paragraph must remain uncertain. In a case of this kind, we are obliged to call in the help of the imagination, if the words of the prophet are to be realized with any degree of vividness. There are some great difficulties in the text, and apparently one interpolation (Vers. 13, 14 being in all probability an incorrect copy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe is me, my mother</span>! This is one of those passages (comp. Introduction) which illustrate the sensitive and shrinking character of our prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"If his meek spirit erred, opprest<br />That God denied repose,<br />What sin is ours, to whom Heaven's rest<br />Is pledged to heal earth's woes?"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Cardinal Newman, in 'Lyra Apostolica,' 88.</span>). I have neither lent on usury, etc.; a speaking figure to men of the ancient world, to whom, as Dr. Payne Smith remarks, "the relations between the money-lender and the debtor were the most fruitful source of lawsuits and quarrellings." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-11.htm">Jeremiah 15:11</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will cause the enemy to entreat thee <i>well</i> in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said</span>. The prophets are usually so tenacious of the same formulae that even their slight deviations are noteworthy. "The Lord said," for "Thus saith the Lord," occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a> (where, however, the phrase has possibly been detached by mistake from the preceding verse). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with thy remnant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I have loosed thee</span> <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy</span>) <span class="accented">good</span>, or, <span class="accented">thy loosing</span> (<span class="accented">shall be</span>) <span class="accented">for</span> (<span class="accented">thy good</span>), according as we adopt the reading of the Hebrew text or that of the margin, which differs in form as slightly as it is possible to do. If we accept the historical setting proposed by Gratz for this paragraph, the reference will be to the "loosing" of Jeremiah from his chains mentioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>. The rendering given here is, however, only a probable one; it is in conformity with the Aramaic usage of the verb (the Targum uses it in this sense in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>), and is supported by its suitability to the context and, philologically, by the fact of the growing influence of Aramaic upon Hebrew. Gesenius, in his anxiety to keep close to the native use of the root, produces a rendering (of the Hebrew marginal reading) which does not suit the context, viz. "I afflict thee for (thy) good." Jeremiah does not complain of being afflicted by God, but that all the world is against him; Ewald, comparing a different Aramaic verb to that appealed to above, renders, "I strengthen thee," etc., which is adopted by Keil, but does not accord with the second half of the verse so well as the rendering adopted. The Authorized Version follows the Targum, the Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, Rashi, and Kimchi, assuming that <span class="accented">sherith</span> is contracted from <span class="accented">sh'erith</span> (as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38</a>), and that "remnant" is equivalent to "remnant of life." But, though the sense is not unacceptable (comp. Vers. 20, 21), the form of expression is unnatural; we should have expected <span class="accented">akharith'ka</span>, "thy latter end" (comp. <a href="../../par/job/8-7.htm">Job 8:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will cause the enemy to entreat thee well</span>. This expression is as difficult as the preceding, and our rendering of it will depend entirely on our view of the context. If "the enemy" means the Chaldeans, the Authorized Version will be substantially correct. Rashi has already mentioned the view that the phrase alludes to Nebnzar-adan's respectful inquiry as to the wishes of Jeremiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-2.htm">Jeremiah 40:2-5</a>. In this case, the literal rendering is, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">will cause the enemy to meet thee</span> (<span class="accented">as a friend</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-3.htm">Isaiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>. But if "the enemy" means the Jews, then we must render, 1 <span class="accented">grill cause the enemy to supplicate thee</span>, and illustrate the phrase by the repeated applications of Zedekiah to the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-3.htm">Jeremiah 37:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14</a>), and the similar appeal of the "captains of the forces," in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-1.htm">Jeremiah 42:1-3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-12.htm">Jeremiah 15:12</a></div><div class="verse">Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall iron break</span>, etc.? Again an enigmatical saying. The rendering of the Authorized Version assumes that <span class="cmt_word">by the northern iron</span> Jeremiah means the Babylonian empire. But the "breaking" of the Babylonian empire was not a subject which lay within the thoughts of the prophet. It was not the fate of Babylon, but his own troubled existence, and the possibility that his foes would ultimately succeed in crushing him, which disquieted this conscientious but timid spokesman of Jehovah. The Divine interlocutor has reminded him in the preceding verse of the mercy which has been already extended to him, and now recalls to his recollection the encouraging assurances given him in his inaugural vision (Jeremiah h 18, 19). Render, therefore, Can one <span class="accented">break iron</span>, <span class="accented">northern iron</span>, <span class="accented">and bronze?</span> The steel of the Authorized Version is evidently a slip. The Hebrew word is <span class="accented">n'khosheth</span>, which means sometimes (e.g. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-25.htm">Deuteronomy 33:25</a>; <a href="../../par/job/28-2.htm">Job 28:2</a>) copper, but more commonly bronze, since "copper unalloyed seems to have been but rarely used after its alloys with tin became known" (Professor Maskelyne). "Steel" would have been more fitly introduced as the second of the three names of metals. "Northern iron" at once suggests the Chalybes, famous in antiquity for their skill in hardening iron, and, according to classical authors (e.g. Stephanus the geographer), the neighbors of the Tibareni, in the country adjoining the Euxine Sea, the Tibareni being, of course, the people of Tubal, whom Ezekiel mentions (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-13.htm">Ezekiel 27:13</a>) as trafficking in vessels of bronze. Any Jew, familiar with the wares of the bazaar, would at once appreciate the force of such a question as this. Even if iron could be broken, yet surely not steel nor bronze. Thus the verse simply reaffirms the original promises to Jeremiah, and prepares the way for Vers. 20, 21. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and <i>that</i> for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy substance</span>, etc. These verses form an unlooked-for digression. The prophet has been in a state of profound melancholy, and the object of Jehovah is to rouse him from it. In Vers. 11, 12, the most encouraging assurances have been given him. Suddenly comes the overwhelming declaration contained in Vers. 13, 14. And when we look closely at these verses, two points strike us, which make it difficult to conceive that Jeremiah intended them to stand here. First, their contents are not at all adapted to Jeremiah, and clearly belong to the people of Judah; and next, they are repeated, with some variations, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3, 4</a>. It should also be observed that the Septuagint (which omits <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1-4</a>) only gives them here, which seems to indicate an early opinion that the passage only ought to occur once in the Book of Jeremiah, though the Septuagint translator failed to choose the right position for it. <span class="cmt_word">Without price;</span> literally, not for a price. In the parallel passage there is another reading, "thy high places," which forms part of the next clause. Hitzig and Graf suppose this to be the original reading, the Hebrew letters having been partly effaced and then misread, after which "not" was prefixed to make sense. However this may be, the present reading is unintelligible, if we compare <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-3.htm">Isaiah 52:3</a>, where Jehovah declares that his people were sold for nothing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were given up entirely to the enemy, without any compensating advantage to Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">And that for all thy sins,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">and in all thy sins and in all thy borders</span>. The text is certainly difficult. Externally a parallelism exists between the two halves of the clause, and one is therefore tempted to render literally. As this will not make sense, however, we are forced either to render as the Authorized Version, or to suppose that the text is not accurately preserved. The parallel passage has a different but not a more intelligible reading. Ewald omits "and" in both halves of the clause, which slightly diminishes the awkwardness. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make thee to pass</span>, etc. The natural rendering of the Hebrew is, "And I will make thine enemies to pass," etc., which clearly cannot be the prophet's meaning. The parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-4.htm">Jeremiah 17:4</a>) has, "And I will make thee to serve thine enemies," etc.; and so the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and many manuscripts here. <span class="cmt_word">For a fire is kindled in mine anger</span>; a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, suggesting that the judgment described in the Song of Moses is about to fall upon Judah.

God's omniscience is the thought which comforts him (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-19.htm">Psalm 69:19</a>). But he desires some visible proof of God's continued care for his servant. <span class="cmt_word">Visit me</span>, equivalent to "be attentive to my wants "-an anthropomorphic expression for the operation of Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Take me not away in thy long-suffering</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "suffer not my persecutors to destroy me through the long-suffering which thou displayest towards them." "Take away," viz. my life (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-4.htm">Ezekiel 33:4</a>, "If the sword come and take him away"). <span class="cmt_word">Rebuke</span>; rather, <span class="accented">reproach</span>; cutup. <a href="../../par/psalms/69-7.htm">Psalm 69:7</a> (<a href="../../par/psalms/69.htm">Psalm 69</a>. is in the style of Jeremiah, and, as Delitzsch remarks, suits his circumstances better than those of David). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-16.htm">Jeremiah 15:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy words were found</span>. Jeremiah here describes his first reception of a Divine revelation. Truth is like "treasure hid in a field;" he alone who seeks it with an unprejudiced mind can "find" it. But there are some things which no "searching" of the intellect can "find" (<a href="../../par/job/11-7.htm">Job 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/37-23.htm">Job 37:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>); yet by a special revelation they may be "found" by God's "spokesmen," or prophets. This is the train of thought which underlies Jeremiah's expression here. The "words," or revelations, of Jehovah are regarded as having an objective existence in the ideal world of which God is the light, and as "descending" from thence (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>) into the consciousness of the prophet. So <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-1.htm">Ezekiel 3:1</a>, "Eat that thou findest." <span class="cmt_word">I did eat them</span>; I assimilated them, as it were (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-8.htm">Ezekiel 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-3.htm">Ezekiel 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am called by thy name</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thy name hath been</span> (or, <span class="accented">had been</span>) <span class="accented">called upon me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have (or, had) been specially dedicated to thy service. The phrase is often used of Israel (see on Jeremiah 14:9), and, as here applied, intimates that a faithful prophet was, as it were, the embodied ideal of an Israelite. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a></div><div class="verse">I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of the mockers</span>; rather, <span class="accented">of the laughers</span>. The serious thoughts arising out of his sacred office restrained him from taking part in the festive meetings to which his youth would naturally incline him (comp. on Jeremiah 16:2). <span class="cmt_word">Because of thy hand</span>. The Hand of Jehovah is a figurative expression for the self-revealing and irresistible power of Jehovah; it is, therefore, equivalent to the Arm of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>), but is used in preference with regard to the divinely ordained actions and words of the prophets. Thus we are told, in the accounts of Elijah and Elisha, that "the hand of the Lord came upon" them (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>). Such a phrase was probably at first descriptive of a completely passive ecstatic state, and was retained when ecstasies had become rare, with a somewhat laxer meaning. Isaiah uses a similar expression but once (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>); Ezekiel, however, who appears to have been unusually rifled with the overpowering thought of the supernatural world, is constantly mentioning "the hand of Jehovah" (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; and especially Ezekiel 3:14; 8:3). We may infer from this variation in the practice of inspired writers that, though symbolical, anthropomorphic language is not always equally necessary in speaking of Divine things, yet it cannot be entirely dispensed with, even by the most gifted and spiritual teachers. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast filled me with indignation</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hadst filled me</span>. Jeremiah was too full of his Divine message to indulge in impracticable sentimentalities. There was no thought of self when Jeremiah received his mission, nor any bitterness towards those who up-posed him. His "indignation" was that of Jehovah, whose simple instrument he was (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>, "I am full of the fury of the Lord"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a></div><div class="verse">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, <i>which</i> refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, <i>and as</i> waters <i>that</i> fail?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why is my pain perpetual</span>? One who could honestly speak of himself in terms such as those of Vers. 16, 17, seemed to have a special claim on the Divine protection. But Jeremiah's hopes have been disappointed. His vexation is perpetual, and his wounded spirit finds no comfort. <span class="cmt_word">As a liar</span>; rather, <span class="accented">as a deceitful stream</span>. The word "stream" has to be understood as in <a href="../../par/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Many of the water courses of Palestine are filled with a rushing torrent in the winter, but dry in summer. Hence the pathetic complaint of Job (<a href="../../par/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>). The opposite phrase to that used by Jeremiah is "a perennial stream" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>). The force of the passage is increased if we read it in the light of Dr. Gratz's hypothesis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-19.htm">Jeremiah 15:19</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, <i>and</i> thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou return</span>, etc. Most commentators regard these words as containing a gentle rebuke to Jeremiah for his doubts respecting God's care of him. It may be questioned, however, whether such passing doubts could be described as a turning away from Jehovah. If the word "return" is to be interpreted in a spiritual sense, we must surely conclude that the people is addressed (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a>). But this does not agree with the context. Hence Gratz's view seems very plausible, that the reference is to the proposal that Jeremiah should place himself under the protection of Gedaliah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, "Go back also to Gedaliah," etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Then will I bring thee again</span>; viz. into the right relation to me, so as to be my minister (Keil). But by altering one of the vowel-points (which form no part of the text), on the authority of the Septuagint, we get a more satisfactory sense, <span class="accented">I will give thee a settled place</span>. <span class="accented">The</span> verb must in any case be coupled with the following one. Jeremiah longs for a quiet home, only as supplying the conditions of prophetic activity. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt stand before me</span>. The phrase is taken from the wont of slaves to stand in their masters' presence, waiting for commands. It is also applied to courtiers (<a href="../../par/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>) and royal councilors (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6</a>), to angels (<a href="../../par/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>) and to prophets (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>). Jeremiah was by God's will to find a new and important mission to the Jews with Gedaliah. <span class="cmt_word">If thou take forth the precious from the vile</span>, etc. The metaphor is derived from metallurgy (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27-30</a>). The prophet is compared to a smelter. By the fervor of his inspired exhortations, he seeks to draw away from the mass of unbelievers all those who are spiritually capable of better things. The "vine-dressers and husbandmen," whom Nebuzar-adan had left after the capture of Jerusalem, though outwardly "the poor of the laud," might yet be ennobled by the word and example of Jeremiah. [Some explain "the precious" and "the vile" differently, taking the former to be the pure Word of God (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-5.htm">Proverbs 30:5</a>), the latter the base, human elements which are apt to be mixed with the Divine message (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>). But was it not the very fidelity of Jeremiah which exposed him to the persecutions of which he has been complaining? Others suppose an inward purification of Jeremiah himself to be intended, "the vile" being those human infirmities of which he had just given evidence, as opposed to "the precious," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the spiritual impulses which come from above. But is not such an explanation too evangelical, too Pauline, for this context?] <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be as my mouth</span>. For devoting himself to this possible "mustard seed" of a better and holier people, the prophet should be rewarded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by close prophetic intercourse with his God, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, as the next clause states, by a moral victory over his opponents. "Mouth" for "prophet," as <a href="../../par/exodus/4-16.htm">Exodus 4:16</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let them return unto thee,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they shall return unto thee</span>, <span class="accented">but thou shalt not return unto them</span>.

Indeed, it was primarily intended for the spiritual nourish-merit of those who had gone before to the unseen world (comp. Bonwick, 'Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought,' p. 48). Chardin, the old traveler, asserts that "the Oriental Christians still make banquets of this kind by a custom derived from the Jews." <span class="cmt_word">The cup of consolation</span>. It would seem as if the funeral feasts had dwindled among the Jews into little more than a refection for the benefit of the mourners.

The question is whether "my mountain in the field" is a vocative or an accusative dependent on "I will give." If the former, then the phrase will mean Jerusalem (comp. "rock of the plain," <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-13.htm">Jeremiah 21:13</a>). This, however, does not suit with the second half of the verse ("thy high places," etch), and still less with ver. 4, which evidently refers to the people of Judah. Added to this, if Jerusalem were here addressed we should certainly expect feminine suffixes. It remains to take "my mountain," etc., as an accusative. It describes, not Jerusalem, but Mount Zion as the site of the temple, the mountain of the house of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-3.htm">Psalm 24:3</a>).

Keil explains, Jehovah declares that he will, on account of the sinful practices upon them, deliver up the high places throughout the land. Gesenius, "He will deliver up the high places <span class="accented">with</span> the sin attaching to them;" Hitzig, "as a sin offering." There is a question, however, whether there is not a corruption in the text, and whether we should not read, with Ewald, "without price for thy sins" (as in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-13.htm">Jeremiah 15:13</a>).

The prophet assumes the truth of a popular belief respecting the partridge (still a common bird in Judaea), that it brooded upon eggs which it had not laid. As the young birds soon leave the false mother, so unjustly acquired riches soon forsake their possessors. [Canon Tristram rejects this explanation, on the ground that the statement is not true to natural history; the partridge neither steals the broods of others nor needs to do so, as it lays a very large number of eggs. But grammar requires us to translate as suggested above, and consequently excludes any other explanation-May not the unusually large number of the eggs laid by the partridge have led to the fancy that they could not be all its own?]

It seems to us, no doubt, singular thus practically to identify, Jehovah and his temple; but the prophet s meaning is that God can only be addressed in so far as he has revealed himself. The temple was not, strictly speaking, the "Name or revelation of God, but it was "the place of the Name of Jehovah," and in the language of strong feeling might be addressed as if it were really the Divine Name. The disciples of the incarnate Name were familiar with the idea that their Master was in some sense the antitype of the temple (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-6.htm">Matthew 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>).

Render, therefore, Thou <span class="accented">throne of glory</span>, <span class="accented">a height from the beginning</span>, <span class="accented">thou place of our sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">thou hope of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>. The temple is called "the throne of thy glory" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>; "height" is a common synonym for heaven (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-8.htm">Psalm 7:8, Hebrew</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>, Hebrew), but is also applied to Mount Zion (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>, quoted by Keil), which is also in <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a> called, "the place of my sanctuary." By adding the concluding words of the address (at the opening of ver. 13), the prophet prevents the suspicion that he attached importance to the mere outward buildings of the temple, like those formalist Jews, whose words are quoted in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-13.htm">Jeremiah 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, <i>and</i> they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that depart from me</span>. The abrupt change of person is extremely harsh; the Vulgate, followed by Ewald and Olshausen, supposes that a final <span class="accented">caph</span> has dropped out, rendering, "they that depart from thee." <span class="cmt_word">Shall be written in the earth</span>; a contrast to that which is recorded for all time "with a pen of iron" (ver. 1). The fountain, etc.; a favorite phrase of our prophet (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-14.htm">Jeremiah 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for thou <i>art</i> my praise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-18.</span> - A prayer of the prophet in this his hour of need.

He prays for healing, <span class="cmt_word">Heal me... and I shall be</span> - rather, <span class="accented">that I may be</span> - <span class="cmt_word">healed</span>. He is one of those "broken in heart," whom Jehovah alone can "heal" (<a href="../../par/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a>).

Hence, as Keil remarks, the discourse of which this forms the conclusion must have been spoken before the first Babylonian invasion of Judah.

The prophet does not follow his own vague inclinations; he is but an under-shepherd, and waits on the will of his superior. He is, as Hosea calls him (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>, Hebrew), "the man of the Spirit." If God leads any one, whether people or individuals, it is through the agency of the Spirit (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11, 12</a>); and it is the characteristic of the typical prophet that his ear is "wakened morning by morning" to receive his daily lesson. Only by thus "following" the Divine Leader, can a prophet act as pastor to his people. [The construction is, however, rather simplified by the rendering - a perfectly legitimate one... <span class="accented">from following thee as a companion</span>.] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The woeful day</span>. The word for "woeful" is the same rendered "desperately wicked" (ver. 9); the "day" of Judah's calamity is metaphorically "sick," like the heart of man. <span class="accented">So</span>, other words being used, <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-11.htm">Isaiah 17:11</a> (end). <span class="cmt_word">Was right before thee</span>; rather (since some adjective must be supplied), <span class="accented">was manifest before thee</span>.

The reward held out is Jerusalem's continuance in all its old pomp, both temporal and spiritual, and the penalty the destruction of the city by fire. This passage stands in absolutely no connection with the preceding and the following prophecies; and we have just the same sense of suspicion in meeting with it here, in the midst of perfectly general exhortations, as in reading the parallel exhortations to Sabbath-keeping in <a href="../../par/isaiah/56.htm">Isaiah 56</a>. and 58, surrounded as they are by the moving and almost evangelical rhetoric of the second part of Isaiah. Geiger and Dr. Rowland Williams have hence been led to conjecture that this section (or part of it) was introduced into the roll of Jeremiah's prophecies to assist the reforming movement of Ezra and Nehemiah. Certainly the regard for the Sabbath, so conspicuous in the later Judaism, dates, so far as we can see, from the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13.htm">Nehemiah 13</a>.), though it is credible enough that the perception of the high importance of this holy day (comp. Heine's 'Prinecssin Sabbath') began to acquire greater distinctness as the other parts of the social and religions organization were seen to be fading away (comp. art. "Sabbath" in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary'). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the gate of the children of the people</span>. It is uncertain which of the gates of Jerusalem is meant, and not perfectly clear what is the meaning of the title. Does it mean Israelites as opposed to foreigners, or laymen as distinguished from priests? <span class="cmt_word">Whereby the kings of Judah come in</span>. Jeremiah appears to use the phrase "kings of Judah" in a particular sense (see on ver. 20). He may, no doubt, simply mean to say that those who are from time to time sovereigns of Judah enter by this gate. But once grant that the prophet does sometimes use the phrase in a sense of his own, and that in the very next verse, and it is very difficult to avoid interpreting it so in this passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-20.htm">Jeremiah 17:20</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - Jeremiah addresses himself first of all to the <span class="cmt_word">kings of Judah</span>. As it would be very unnatural for a public orator to appeal to the yet unborn members of the reigning dynasty, and as there are several indications that the "house of David" was able at this period, as also in that of Isaiah, to exercise a decisive political and civil influence, even, as appears from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-11.htm">Jeremiah 21:11, 12</a>, monopolizing the judicial functions, it is natural to suppose that "kings of Judah" is here used in a very special sense, via. of the members of the various branches of the royal family ("The sons of the <span class="accented">king</span>," <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-8.htm">Zephaniah 1:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-26.htm">Jeremiah 36:26</a>, "Jerahmeel, a king's son"), and their descendants, who received the royal title by courtesy (parallels for this will be found in Gesenius's 'Hebrew Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>.<span class="accented">me'lek</span>). The queen-mother was probably the leader of this plan; "the mistress," as she was called (see on Jeremiah 13:18), and the royal princes (among whom the "house of Nathan," <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a>, would doubtless be reckoned), constituted in fact a body almost as numerous as they did (according to Brugsch Bey) in Egypt, and politically much more influential; so much so indeed that only a king of unusual force of character, like Hezekiah or Josiah, could venture, and that timidly, to oppose them. The weak-principled Zedekiah seems to have been entirely dominated by this powerful caste, and to have been little more than a <span class="accented">maire du palais</span> (the same sense of the phrase is required in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>, and probably in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>).

God has the sovereign right to do as he wills with his own handiwork; thus much can be expressed by the figure. But the moral element in Jeremiah's teaching stands outside this, viz. that the Divine action is governed, not by mere caprice, but a regard for character. "The thought is not so much the arbitrariness as the patience of God, who will bring men to be what he would have them be in the end, as the potter eventually twists the clay to the shape he originally intended, stubborn as the clay may <span class="accented">be</span>." But whether Jeremiah meant the lesson which Mr. Maurice deduces from his words may be gravely doubted. It is not of individuals that the prophet is thinking, but of the <span class="accented">nation</span>, and not of the nation as destined to be all but certainly saved, but as placed before a serious and awful decision. (For different lessons derived from the same figure, see the ' Rabbi Ben Ezra' of Browning.) Egypt and Palestine were, as it seems, at one in the extreme simplicity of the potter's art. Dr. Birch has given us an account of the Egyptian potter at his work, as he appears in the pictorial representations at Beni Hassan ('Ancient Pottery,' pp. 33-35), and Dr. Thomson has described the procedure of a potter in modern Palestine ('The Land and the Book,' p. 520). The chief difference between them seems to be that in Egypt the wheel was turned with the left hand, and the vase shaped with the right, while in modern Palestine the wheel is turned with the fool "Taking a lump in his hand," says Dr. Thomson, "he placed it on the top of the wheel (which revolves horizontally), and smoothed it into a low cone, like the upper end of a sugar-loaf; then thrusting his thumb into the top of it, he opened a hole down through the center, and this he constantly widened by pressing the edges of the revolving cone between his hands. As it enlarged and became thinner, he gave it whatever shape he pleased with the utmost ease and expedition." It should be observed that in ver. 3 the "wheels," or rather "two wheels," spoken of are simply the two round plates which formed the horizontal lathe of the potter.

This passage is unusually obscure. Literally we must, it would seem, render, <span class="accented">Doth the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field</span> (or possibly, <span class="accented">cease to flow from the rock unto the field</span>)? This is explained as pointing a contrast to the infidelity of God's people. "The snow never leaves the summit of Lebanon; the waters which take their rise therein never dry up; but my people have forgotten the law of their being, the source of their prosperity." The rendering of the first clause is, however, grammatically dubious (there is no example of this construction of '<span class="accented">azabh</span>), and all the old versions point to (or at least favor) a reading, <span class="accented">Shaddai</span> (the Almighty) instead of <span class="accented">sadai</span> (the field). If we keep the text, we must explain "the rock of the field" on the analogy of "my mountain in the field" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>), as meaning "the rock which commands a wide prospect over the open lowland country," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Mount Lebanon. <span class="cmt_word">The cold flowing waters</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the numerous "streams from Lebanon," referred to in <a href="../../par/songs/4-15.htm">Song of Solomon 4:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That come from another place;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whoso sources are foreign. But as this does not suit the connection, it is better to take the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">zarim</span>), usually rendered "foreign," in the sense of "pressing or hurrying along," with Ewald, Graf, and virtually Henderson. It thus becomes descriptive of these streams "as contracted within narrow channels while descending through the gorges and defiles of the <span class="accented">rocks</span>." Camp.

But there were wise men and wise men. Some appear, to have "mocked" at the earnest preaching of the prophets (hence the solemn rebukes in the Book of Proverbs), others to have as it were prepared the way for the latter by a more or less distinct recognition of the religious foundation of morality, and of these we have ample monuments in the canonical Proverbs. There may also have been other shades and varieties of wise men, for their characteristic was not a faculty of intuition, but rather of reflectively applying fundamental moral principles. One highly esteemed branch of "wisdom" would, of course, be political, and this would be the most liable to perversion. It is of such (Proverbs 29:14). <span class="cmt_word">Nor the word from the prophet</span>. "The word" is a general term for prophesying. Of course, the speakers take no account of the advance in prophecy from the time, at any rate, of Amos.

It was also familiar to the Assyrians: King Assurba-nipal declares at the opening of his ' Annals ' that the gods "in the body of his mother have made (him) to rule Assyria." Familiar, too, to the great family of religious reformers. For, as Dean Milman has truly observed, "No Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution. He who is destined for such a work must have a full conviction that God is acting directly, immediately, consciously, and therefore with irresistible power, upon him and through him He who is not predestined, who does not declare, who does not believe himself  predestined as the author of a great religions movement, he in whom God is not manifestly, sensibly, avowedly working out his pre-established designs, will never be saint or reformer" ('Latin Christianity,' 1:111, 112). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctified thee</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. set thee apart for holy uses. <span class="cmt_word">Ordained</span>; rather, <span class="accented">appointed</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the nations</span>.

Jeremiah had said that he was unskilled in oratory; the Divine answer is that the words which he has to speak are not his own, but those of Jehovah. Two things are obvious: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The touching of the lips is not purely metaphorical, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>); it represents a real experience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> This experience, however, can only have been a visionary one, analogous to that vouchsafed to Isaiah at the opening of his prophetic ministry. In the grand account given by Isaiah of his inaugural vision (which has evidently influenced the form of the vision of Jeremiah), we read of the same significant act on the part of one of the seraphim. It is the same act, certainly, but it symbolizes, not as here the communication of a prophetic message (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>), but the purification of the lips. Does it not seem as if Isaiah had attained a deeper insight into the spiritual regeneration needed by the prophet than had been granted to Jeremiah? Another point in which Jeremiah's account seems inferior to that of Isaiah is plastic power. Notice how Jeremiah dwells upon the meaning of the words; this is a reflective element which diminishes the poetic power of the narrative. A word may Be added to explain that "visionary" is not here used in opposition to "based on fact." That the two epithets are susceptible of combination is well shown in the vision described by Pere Gratry, in his 'Souvenirs do ma Jeunesse' (pp. 102-105), the reality of which is not in the least impaired in the writer's mind by its thoroughly inward character: "Dens teutes ces seines interieures, je n'imaginais rien... c'etaient de saisissantes et tres-energiques realites auxquelles je ne m'attendais nullement."

As there is so much more threatening than promise in Jeremiah's writings, the destructive side of his activity is expressed by four verbs, the constructive only by two.

The first expresses the certainty of his prophetic revelation; the second indicates its contents. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A rod of an almond tree</span>. The name here adopted for the almond tree is peculiarly suitable in this connection. It means "wakeful;" the almond, blossoming in January, is the first to "wake" from the sleep of winter.

There is a variety of Hebrew words for "pot." The word here used suggests a vessel of large size, since pottage for a whole company of prophets could be cooked in such. a pot or caldron (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>). From <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a> we may infer that it was of metal. A "seething pot" in ancient Arabic poetry is a figure for war. The same symbol occurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-12</a>, but with a different application. <span class="cmt_word">The face thereof is toward the north</span>; rather, <span class="accented">toward the south</span>; literally, <span class="accented">from the face of the north</span>. The "face" of the pet is the side turned to the prophet. We may suppose the contents to be on the point of boiling over.

Previously to the battle of Carchemish, the Babylonians are only mentioned vaguely as a northern people (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-22.htm">Jeremiah 10:22</a>). Strictly speaking, they were an eastern people from the point of view of Palestine; but the caravan-road which the Chaldaean armies had to take entered Palestine at Dan (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-15.htm">Jeremiah 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>), and then proceeded southward. (On the question whether a Scythian invasion is referred to, at least conjointly with the Babylonian, see Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">An evil</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the evil</span>; viz. the calamity which in deepening gloom forms the burden of the prophet's discourses. <span class="cmt_word">Shall break forth</span>; literally, shall <span class="accented">open</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. let loose by opening (comp. the use of the same verb in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-17.htm">Isaiah 14:17</a>, literally, "looseth not his prisoners homewards;" and <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>, literally, "that we may open," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "bring forth wheat"). There is, however, some difficulty in explaining the choice of this expression. We might indeed suppose that the caldron had a lid, and that the removal or falling off of this lid is the "opening" referred to by the phrase. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-15.htm">Jeremiah 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will call</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I am calling</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

But more probably it is simply a suggestive phrase, for the wide extent of the hostile empire referred to (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall set every one his throne</span>, etc. The kings, or. the, generals, representing "all the families, etc., shall set up the high seat of power and judicial authority at the broad space within the gate of the city, which constituted the Oriental forum (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-21.htm">Job 31:21</a>). Thither the besieged would have to come to surrender themselves (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>) and to hear their fate. A similar prediction is made with regard to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9, 10</a>). It is true the seat of authority is there said to be placed at the entrance of the palace, but this was in fact another place where justice was wont to be administered (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-2.htm">Jeremiah 22:2, 3</a>). Jerome's view, adopted by Rosenm&uuml;ller and Nagelsbach, that "to set one's seat" means "to besiege" is against usage, and does not accord with the opening words of ver. 16. There is, however, an element of truth in it. The judgment executed ministerially by the northern kings or generals began with the siege of Jerusalem and the other cities, and hence the words with which the prophet continues. <span class="cmt_word">And against all the walls</span>, etc. We should have expected something like "and shall set themselves in array against," etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-7.htm">Isaiah 22:7</a> b); see, however, last note. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will utter my judgments</span>; or, I <span class="accented">will hold a court of justice upon them</span>; literally, I <span class="accented">will speak judgments with them</span>. The expression is peculiar to Jeremiah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>), and includes both the examination of the accused, and the judicial sentence (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness</span>, etc. Their "wickedness," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their infidelity to Jehovah, showed itself in burning incense to "other gods," and bowing down to their images. "Burned incense" is, however, too narrow a sense. The root-meaning of the verb is to be fragrant, and the causative conjugations will strictly mean only "to make a sweet odor," whether by the offering of incense or by burnt offerings (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-12.htm">Jeremiah 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>, where a causative conjugation is used in the same wide sense here postulated; also <a href="../../par/psalms/66-15.htm">Psalm 66:15</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13</a>, where the word usually rendered "incense" seems rather to mean "a sweet smoke"). The prophet says, "of other gods" (not "of false gods"), out of consideration for the ignorance of his hearers, to whom Baal and Moloch really were as gods; in fact, that expressive word (cf.) which Isaiah uses ten times to express the unreality of the other so-called gods, occurs only once, and then not in quite the same sense (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a>) in Jeremiah. But the prophet's own strict monotheism is proved by such passages as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>a; Jeremiah 8:19b; Jeremiah 16:20. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gird up thy loins</span>, as an Oriental does before making any kind of physical exertion, whether walking (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29</a>), running (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), or fighting (<a href="../../par/job/12-21.htm">Job 12:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Be not dismayed</span>. A want of confidence on Jeremiah's part will issue in his utter discomfiture by his enemies. "Dismay" in Hebrew has a twofold reference, subjective ("dismay") and objective ("ruin," "discomfiture"). Both references can be illustrated from this verse. (Comp. the command and - ver. 18 - premise to Jeremiah with the command and promise to Ezekiel -  3:8, 9.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brasen walls</span>. The plural is used instead of a collective term for the whole circle of fortifications. In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>) the singular occurs; the same alternation of plural and singular as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-10.htm">2 Kings 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>. The combination of figures strikingly expresses the invincibility of one whose strength is in his God. <span class="cmt_word">The kings of Judah</span>. Why the plural? Most reply, Because Jeremiah would have to do with successive sovereigns. But this meaning would have been just as well conveyed by the singular: "the king of Judah," without any name being added - would moan the king who from time to time happened to be reigning. "Kings of Judah" in Jeremiah seems to have a special meaning, and to include all the members of the royal family, who formed a numerous and powerful class (see on Jeremiah 17:20).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The "stocks" were sometimes kept in a special house (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-10.htm">2 Chronicles 16:10</a>); these mentioned here, however, apparently stood in public, at the high - or rather, upper - <span class="cmt_word">gate of Benjamin</span>, which was by - or, <span class="accented">at - <span class="cmt_word"></span>the house of the Lord</span>. The gate, then, was one of the temple gates, and is called "the upper" to distinguish it from one of the city gates which bore the same name (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>). It is presumably the same which is called "the new gate of the Lord's house" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>), as having been comparatively lately built (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>).

Jeremiah refers to the hesitation he originally felt to accepting the prophetic office (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>.). The verb does not mean "to deceive," but "to entice" (so rendered in ver. 10, Authorized Version), or "allure." The same word is used in that remarkable narrative of "the spirit" who offered to "entice" (Authorized Version, to "persuade") Ahab to "go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-21.htm">1 Kings 22:21</a>). In Ezekiel, too, the same case is supposed as possible of Jehovah's "enticing" a prophet (Ezekiel 15:9). The expression implies that all events are, in some sense, caused by God, even those which are, or appear to be, injurious to the individual. Was Goethe thinking of this passage when he wrote the words, "Wen Gott betrugt, ist wohl be-trogon?" Applying the words in a Christian sense, we may say (with F. W. Robertson) that God teaches us by our illusions. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou didst take hold on me</span>, <span class="accented">and didst prevail</span>. The expression is like "Jehovah spake thus to me with a grasp of the hand" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-8.htm">Jeremiah 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For since I spake, I cried out</span>, etc.; rather, For as <span class="accented">often as I speak</span>, <span class="accented">I must shout</span>; <span class="accented">I must cry</span>, <span class="accented">Violence and spoil</span>; <span class="accented">I can</span> take up no other tone but that of indignant denunciation, no other theme but that of the acts of injustice constantly committed (not merely, nor indeed chiefly, against the prophet himself). <span class="cmt_word">Was made</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is made</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-9.htm">Jeremiah 20:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name.

The prophet has repeatedly been tempted to withdraw from the painful duty, but his other and higher self (comp. 'Old Self and New Self' in the 'Lyra Apostolica') overpowers these lower bayings for peace and quiet. The fire of the Divine wrath against sin burns so fiercely within him that he cannot help resuming his work.

This gives us the reason for Ms momentary inclinations to silence. He was surrounded by bitter enemies, who were no longer content with malicious words, but urged each other on to lay an information against him with the authorities as a public criminal. The first clause agrees verbatim with part of <a href="../../par/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a> (this is one of the psalms attributed, by a too bold conjecture, to Jeremiah). "There is terror on every side" (see above, ver. 3, and also note on Jeremiah 6:25) means "everything about me inspires me with terror." <span class="cmt_word">All my familiars is</span>, literally, <span class="accented">all the men of my peace</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those with whom I have been on terms of friendship (same phrase, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-22.htm">Jeremiah 38:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Watched for my halting</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either laid traps for me or waited for me to commit some error for them to take advantage cf.

The passage is a further development of the complaint in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-10.htm">Jeremiah 15:10</a>, and stands in no connection with the consolatory close of the preceding passage. There is a very striking parallel in <a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-12</a>, and the question cannot be evaded, Which is the original? It is difficult to believe that Jeremiah copied from an earlier poem. Deep emotion expresses itself in language suggested by the moment; and, even after retouching his discourses, Jeremiah would leave much of the original expression. But impressions of this sort cannot be unreservedly trusted. The argument from parallel passages is only a subsidiary one in the determination of the date of books.

Of Gilead in general, Canon Tristram writes, "No one can fairly judge of Israel's heritage who has not seen the luxuriant exuberance of Gilead, as well as the bard rocks of Judaea." And again, "Lovely knolls and dells open out at every turn, gently rising to the wooded plateau above. Then we rise to higher ground and ride through noble forests of oak. Then for a mile or two through luxuriant green corn, or perhaps through a rich forest of scattered olive trees, left untended and uncared for, with perhaps patches of corn in the open glades" ('Bible Places,' p. 322). The cedars of Lebanon, however diminished, still bear witness to the ancient fame of this splendid mountain district. <span class="cmt_word">A wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited</span>. The comparison has a terrible significance when read in the light of De Vogue's and Freshfield's discoveries. For Gilead itself is full of ruined cities of massive stone architecture. "It is no uncommon thing," says Mr. F.A. Eaton, "to see these houses in a complete state of preservation, built of huge blocks of black basalt, with slabs of the same for the roof, twelve feet long, a foot and a half wide, and half a foot thick, and entrance doors also of basalt... great solid stones of the same material being used as lintels at the top and bottom" (Speech at the meeting for setting on foot the survey of Eastern Palestine, November 30, 1880: <span class="accented">Statement of Palestine Exploration Fund</span>, January, 1880, p. 11). <span class="accented">Cities which are not inhabited</span>; not, indeed, the cities of Gilead of the time of Jeremiah, but constructed of materials which may reasonably be presumed to have been chiseled in a far more remote antiquity. (The date of the cities in their present state is subsequent to the Christian era.)

The king referred to is probably Jehoahaz, who, though two years younger than Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-31.htm">2 Kings 23:31</a>; comp. 36), was preferred to him by the people on the death of Josiah. The counsel to "weep sore" for this royal exile was carried out, as Mr. Samuel Cox observes (and we have, perhaps, a specimen of the popular elegies upon him in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-1.htm">Ezekiel 19:1-4</a>): "A young lion of royal strain, caught untimely, and chained and carried away captive, - this was how the people of Israel conceived of Shallum" ('Biblical Expositions,' p. 120). The conjecture is incapable of proof; and Ezekiel, we know, was fond of imaginative elegies. But probably enough he was in harmony with popular feeling on this occasion. The identification of Shallum with Jehoahaz is confirmed by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a> (Shallum, the youngest son of Josiah); the name appears to have been changed on his accession to the throne, just as Eliakim was changed to Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-4.htm">2 Chronicles 36:4</a>). There is, therefore, no occasion to suppose an ironical allusion to the short reign of Jehoahaz, which might be compared to that of the Israelitish king Shallum (somewhat as Jezebel addresses Jehu as "O Zimri, murderer of his lord," <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a>). This view has the support of F. Junius (professor at Leyden, 1592), of Graf, and Rowland Williams; but why should not the Chronicler, though writing in the Persian period, have drawn here, as well as elsewhere in the genealogies, from ancient traditional sources? There is nothing in ver. 11 to suggest an allusion to the fate of the earlier Shallum.

He "had, besides, a passion for building splendid and costly houses; and as he esteemed his own position secure under the protection of a superior power, he did not scruple severely to oppress his helpless subjects, and wring from them as much money as possible" (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' 4:252; see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33-35</a>). The building mania, to which Oriental sovereigns have always been prone, had seized upon Jehoiakim. The architecture of the original palace no longer, perhaps, suited the higher degree of civilization; the space was as confined as that of a Saxon mansion would have appeared to a Norman. <span class="cmt_word">That buildeth his house by unrighteousness</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as the second half-verse explains, by not paying the workmen (comp. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>).

(This involves no change of letters, but a very slight rearrangement, and the alteration of one point; grammar gains greatly by the change.) "Cutteth out" is, literally, rend-<span class="accented">eth</span>; it is the word used in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a> of the apparent enlargement of the eyes by putting powdered antimony upon the eyelids. Windows are, as it were, the eyes of a building (Graf compares <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a>).

The second part of the clause must at any rate be. altered. Some render, "because thou viest (with thy forefathers) in cedar" (i.e. in building cedar palaces). Hitzig would strike out "in cedar," as having intruded from the preceding line (such a phenomenon meets us occasionally in the received Hebrew text), but this does not help us to a 'connected translation of the passage. Graf's rendering is grammatical, and not against usage; it is, "Dost thou reign because thou art eager about cedar-wood?" and yet the impression left on the mind is that there is some error in the text. The Septuagint finds a reference to one of Jehoiakim's predecessors, "because thou viest with Ahaz" (so the Vatican Codex), or, "... with Ahab" (so the Alexandrine and the Sinaitic or Friderico-Augustan). The latter king is celebrated in the Old Testament on account of his buildings, especially his ivory palace (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>:39). The former was at any rate addicted to the imitation of foreign ways (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-11.htm">2 Kings 20:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did not thy father eat and drink?</span> There was no call upon Jehoiakim to live the life of a Nazarite. "Eating and drinking," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoying the good things within his reach, was perfectly admissible (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>); indeed, the Old Testament view of life is remarkable for its healthy naturalness. There was, however, one peremptory condition, itself as much in accordance with nature as with the Law of God, that the rights of other men should be studiously regarded. Josiah "ate and drank," but he also "did judgment and justice," and so "it was well with him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a></div><div class="verse">He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then <i>it was</i> well <i>with him: was</i> not this to know me? saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm">

The Babylonian kings, too, received the honors of public mourning, e.g. even the last of his race, who surrendered to Cyrus, according to the British Museum inscription translated by Mr. Pinches. <span class="cmt_word">Ah my brother! or, Ah sister!</span> The Septuagint omits the latter part of this phrase, apparently because it seemed inappropriate to the death of Jehoiakim; but the parallelism requires a two-membered clause. According to Movers, the funeral procession is to be conceived of as formed of two parts, condoling with each other on having to share the same fate ('Die Phonizier,' 2. 248). Or perhaps mythology may supply a reason; it is possible that the formulae of public mourning were derived from the ceremonies of the Adonia; Adonis was an androgynous deity (Lenormant, 'Lettres assyriologiques,' 2:209), and might be lamented by his devotees as at once "brother" and "sister." (For another view, see Sayco's edition of G. Smith's 'Chaldean Genesis,' p. 267). Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-13.htm">Ezekiel 8:13</a>) testifies to the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis, and the highest compliment a king could receive might be to be lamented in the same terms as the sun-god. Jeremiah does not approve this; he merely describes the popular custom. The recognition of the deeply rooted heathenism of the Jews before the Exile involves no disparagement to Old Testament religion; rather it increases the cogency of the argument for its supernatural origin. For how great was the contrast between Jeremiah and his semi-heathen countrymen! And yet Jeremiah's religion is the seed of the faith which overcame the world. <span class="cmt_word">Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> Lord is in the Hebrew <span class="accented">adon</span> (comp. Adonis and see above). <span class="accented">His glory</span> is against the parallelism; we should expect "lady" or "queen."

Hitzig thinks the latter number is to be preferred; his chief reasons are the prominence given to the queen-mother, and the fact that the length of Jehoiachin's reign is given with more precise accuracy in 2 Chronicles than in 2 Kings. It is true that the king's wives are mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>. But that he had wives may, according to Hitzig, have been inferred by the late compiler of Kings from the passage before us; or the "wives" may have been those of Jehoiachin's predecessor (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Graf's conjecture is, perhaps, the safest view of the case, whether we accept the number eighteen or the number eight; it is that the "seed" spoken of as born to Jehoiachin in his captivity, and is reckoned to him by anticipation. It should be mentioned, however, that the Septuagint omits "he and his seed" altogether.

"To visit" often, by a natural association of ideas, means "to give attention to." By an equally natural association, it means "to fall upon, to punish."

For the evil shepherds "fed themselves, and fed not my flock" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall fear no more.</span> Ezekiel again contributes an essential feature to the description. The neglect of the shepherds left the flock exposed to the ravages of wild beasts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they be lacking</span>. A speaking phrase. Too many of the sheep had fallen down precipices or been carried off by lions. Yet the context rather favors a slight and palaeographically natural emendation of Hitzig, "Neither shall they be terrified." The Septuagint omits the word altogether, which favors the supposition that they read as Hitzig would read, for they are apt to condense by omitting synonyms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - (Comp. the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15, 16</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come</span>. The use of the analogous phrase, "And it shall come to pass in that day," would lead us to suppose that this verse describes a fresh stage in the progress of events, as if the faithful shepherds (ver. 4) were to precede the "righteous Branch" (ver. 5). Such a view, however, is not very plausible, for the Messtab, according to prophecy, is to appear in the darkest of times. The prophet simply means to impress upon us the greatness of the revelation which he is about to communicate. <span class="cmt_word">I will raise unto David</span>. The promised Messiah, then, is certainly to be of the family of David (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A righteous Branch</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a righteous Plant</span>: the root means "to bud, or sprout." This is the first time in which the title the Plant is unmistakably applied to the Messianic King (possibly, but <span class="accented">less</span> probably, to the Messianic kings). It indicates that this great personage stands in connection with the divinely ordained and ancient royal family, but that he is in some way unique, and far surpasses his human ancestors. He "springs forth;" therefore he is not a sort of meteoric appearance, without any natural home among men, but rather the blossom of the Jewish nation, the embodiment of its highest qualities. And yet there is something extraordinary about him, for it is needful that Jehovah himself should "raise" this Plant from the almost worn-out stock of David. Note that the word rendered here in the Authorized Version "Branch" is not the same as that in the parallel passage in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>). It is, however, the word employed in <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>, which is taken by many, especially the elder interpreters (but with very doubtful justice), to be a prophecy of the Messiah. It is also the word used by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>), as a <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Messiah, which is one strong reason for rejecting the view mentioned above that the word rendered "the Branch," or "the Plant," is to be taken collectively as equivalent to "branches," or rather "plants" (the article is not expressed in the Hebrew). In short, this passage and the prophecies referred to in Jeremiah are exceptions to the general Old Testament usage of the Hebrew word (<span class="accented">cemakh</span>), which is elsewhere a collective term equivalent to "plantation." It is true that in ver. 4 "shepherds," in the plural, are spoken of, but there is no reason why this title should be confined to kings - it may as fairly be <span class="accented">extended</span> to the chief rulers under a king as the term "king" itself (see on Jeremiah 17:20); and true, further, that ill <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a> a continuous succession is promised of Davidic heirs to the throne, but this is not decisive in favor of the collective meaning, any more than Isaiah's later prophecy that "the [reigning Davidic] king shall reign in righteousness" disproves the strictly Messianic reference of his earlier promise in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>. All prophecy is conditional; there may have been moral reasons why a continuance of the Davidic dynasty was held out by Jeremiah at one time as a possible prospect. (It is, however, extremely probable that <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a> is the work of some other inspired writer; see <span class="accented">ad loc</span>.) The thirty-fourth chapter of Ezekiel, which is so closely parallel to this section, appears to interpret the prophecy of a single Messianic king (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And a King shall reign</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and he shall reign as king</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he shall be the realized ideal of an Israelitish king - a second David. <span class="cmt_word">And prosper</span>; or, <span class="accented">and deal wisely</span>. There is the same doubt as to the rendering of the verb in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a> a. The radical idea is that of wisdom, and the analogy of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a> favors the alternative rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Shall execute judgment</span>; in contrast to the neglectful conduct of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall dwell safely</span>. In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) we read "Jerusalem," and there can hardly be a doubt that "Jerusalem" ought to be restored here. This is not the-only instance in which, by mistake, the scribe has written "Israel" instead of "Jerusalem" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-30.htm">Jeremiah 32:30, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-49.htm">Jeremiah 51:49</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>). In <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a> the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word, "Jerusalem," after the wrong one, "Israel," but without canceling the latter (Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' 1880, pp. 97-101). <span class="cmt_word">And this is his name whereby he shall be called</span>. There is a various reading, which may be rendered either, <span class="accented">whereby they shall call</span> (<span class="accented">him</span>, or her), or, <span class="accented">which they shall proclaim</span>, supported by the Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, and a few manuscripts (St. Jerome, too, mentions this reading). There is also a more important difference among the commentators as to the person who was to bear the name. The older Christian interpreters contended with all their might for the view that the name belonged to the Messiah, partly on real philological grounds, partly with the illegitimate theological object of obtaining a proof-text for the orthodox doctrine of the person of the Messiah and (in the case of Protestant writers) of justification. It is much to the credit of Hengstenberg that he sets this object aside, and while maintaining the Messianic reference of the pronoun interprets the name with a single eye to the requirements of the context, "He by whom and under whom Jehovah will be our righteousness." The objection is that in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>) Jeremiah assigns the name "Jehovah-Tsidkenu," not to the Messiah, but to Jerusalem. The prophet must be allowed to be his best interpreter, so that we must, it would seem, at any rate, reject the Messianic reference. But then how are we to explain the pronoun? It is right to refer the parallel pronoun in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> to "Jerusalem," because the pronoun there is feminine, and evidently refers to a city, but it is not natural in our passage to explain "his name" of "Israel," seeing that the subject of the noun in the parallel line is, not Israel, but the Messiah. is the text here correct? A comparison of the parallel psalms Psalms 14 and Psalms 53, and of the corresponding chapters in Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles, will show how easily errors made their way into duplicate copies of the same passage. Granting that we have such duplicate copies of this prophecy in Jeremiah, there can be no doubt which is the more original; the form of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> has a difficulty from which <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a> is free - a difficulty of interpretation and a difficulty also of grammar. For, as Ewald has already pointed out ('Hebrew Grammar,' &sect; 249 b), the contracted suffix is very rarely attached to the simple imperfect, and the clear style in which this section is written justifies us in regarding any unusual form with suspicion. "Israel" thus was probably written by mistake for "Jerusalem," and this error soon led to others - first, the omission of "her," and then the prefixing of "his name" for clearness, and (on the part of the authors of the points) the mispointing of the verb (so as to include in the form the pronoun "him"). It is some confirmation of this view that there are several other passages in which the words "Israel" and "Jerusalem" appear to have been confounded (see preceding note). Read, therefore, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-16.htm">Jeremiah 33:16</a>, And this is <span class="accented">the name wherewith she shall be called</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">Yahveh</span> (Jehovah) <span class="accented">Tsidkenu</span>. The name is formed on the analogy of other symbolic names, such as El-elohe-Israel (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-20.htm">Genesis 33:20</a>), Jehovah-Nisei (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a> ), and especially Jehovah-Shammah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>), also a name of Jerusalem. These names are, in fact, sentences; Jehovah-Shammah, for instance, means "The Lord (is) there;" and the name in the present verse, "The Lord (is) our Righteousness" (Hengstenberg's view mentioned above seems less natural). It is singular that Zedekiah's name should come so near to that announced by the prophet. But there is still a difference between them. Zedekiah must mean "The Lord (is) righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is ever faithful to his revealed principles of action. But Jehovah-Tsidkenu may be correctly paraphrased, "The Lord is the author of our <span class="accented">prosperity</span>," or, more strictly, "of the justification of our claims in the sight of our enemies" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-24.htm">Isaiah 45:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/50-8.htm">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-1.htm">Isaiah 62:1, 2</a>).

In the Septuagint it is placed at the end of the chapter (being possibly supplied from another Hebrew manuscript), and the form given in this version to the close of ver. 6 (<span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, combining the opening words of ver. 9) shows that ver. 9 followed immediately upon ver. 6 in the Hebrew manuscript.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-18.htm">Jeremiah 23:18</a></div><div class="verse">For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard <i>it</i>?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who hath stood in the counsel of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the council</span>. This verse is connected with ver. 16; it gives the reason why the false prophets were not to be listened to. None of them had been admitted to the secret council of the Lord; the interrogation is here a form of denial. "To stand in the council" is not the same as "to sit" (<a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>); the latter phrase implies taking an active part in the consultations. It is specially applicable to the true prophets, according to ver. 22, and this, as we gather from other passages, m a twofold sense. Sometimes the prophets had visions, in which their inner eye was granted a sight of Jehovah in consultation with his trusted servants (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, comp. 8; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>); and the words of Eliphaz, "Weft thou listening in the council of God?" (<a href="../../par/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>), appear to be descriptive of a similar experience. But the phrase may also be used in a wider sense of entirely unecstatic revelations. Amos says (<a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), "Surely the Lord Jehovah will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret counsel unto his servants the prophets; ' and a psalmist extends the term "secret counsel" to the communion which God grants to the pious in general (<a href="../../par/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-32.htm">Proverbs 3:32</a>). Thus there is no hard and-fast line between the experiences of the prophets and those of humbler believers. In so far as the latter are "disciples of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>), they too may be truly said to "stand," at least in the doorway, "in the council of Jehovah;" just as a well-known collect inherited from the Latin Church beseeches that "by God's holy inspiration we may think those things that he good." <span class="cmt_word">Who hath marked his word</span>? A Jewish tradition, represented by the marginal notes in the Hebrew Bible, has taken offence at this variation in the expression, and would correct the reading to "my word." But such changes of person are of frequent occurrence, and we know that the prophets were thoroughly assured that the word which they spoke was not theirs, but that of him who sent them.

The prophet's interpretation of the image. It is the judicial anger of Jehovah, personified as Divine manifestations so often are (hence "shall not return"). The form of the verse reminds us of <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the latter days</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in future days</span>, as Dr. Henderson rightly renders. It seems better to restrict the term "latter days" to the Messianic period ("the coming age," <a href="../../par/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>), to which, in fact, it is often applied (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). The phrase in itself simply means "in the sequel of the days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the future; its Messianic reference, when this exists, is inferred solely from the context. In the passage before us, and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30, 30</a>:29, there can be no intention of pointing to the Messianic age. Precisely the same phrase occurs in an Assyrian inscription, where its meaning is clear from the context (<span class="accented">aria akhrat yumi irib</span>, "For a sequel of days - i.e., for a future time - I deposited"). In the present case it is no distant period to which the prophet refers, for he continues, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall consider it</span>, etc., or rather, <span class="accented">ye shall understand it clearly</span>, viz. that the calamities which will have come upon you are the Divine judgment upon your sins. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21</a></div><div class="verse">I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - In vers. 17-20 Jeremiah has shown that these cannot be true prophets, because their message is diametrically opposed to the true revelation.

("At hand" equivalent to "near.") Eliphaz may again assist us with an illustration. "And thou sayest " - he is expostulating with Job - "What doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; yea, he walketh upon the vault of heaven" (<a href="../../par/job/22-13.htm">Job 22:13, 14</a>).

Jeremiah mentions it as one of the marks of a false prophet that he appealed to his dreams (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>); true prophecy contented itself with less ambiguous media of communication with the unseen world. It may be objected that Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-12.htm">Genesis 15:12</a>), at any rate, and Abimelech (<a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>) received Divine revelations in dreams; but these were not officially prophets. Nathan and the contemporaries of the author of Job had messages from God by night, but these are called, not dreams, but visions (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, comp. 17; <a href="../../par/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). Deuteronomy (and this is one of its striking points of agreement with Jeremiah) expressly describes a false prophet as "a dreamer of dreams" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>). Two passages in the Old Testament seem inconsistent with this discouragement of dreams as a medium of revelation - <a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>, where the Lord is said to make himself known to prophets by visions and dreams, and <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, where the prophetic dreams of the old men are one of the features of a Messianic description; but it is noteworthy that the first of these refers to the primitive period of Israel's history, and the second to the distant Messianic age. In its classical period prophecy kept itself sedulously aloof from a field on which it had such compromising companionship (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-26.htm">Jeremiah 23:26</a></div><div class="verse">How long shall <i>this</i> be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, <i>they are</i> prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long shall this be in the heart</span>, etc.? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> how long shall this be their purpose, viz. to prophesy lies? But this rendering leaves out of account a second interrogative which in the Hebrew follows "how long." It is better to translate this difficult passage, with De Dieu and many moderns, thus: "How long (<span class="accented">quousque durabit haec ipsorum impudentia</span>)<span class="accented">?</span> Is it in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, and the prophets of the deceit of their own heart; are they thinking (I say) to cause my people to forget," etc.? On this view, ver. 27 resumes the question interrupted in ver. 26. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-27.htm">Jeremiah 23:27</a></div><div class="verse">Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his neighbor</span>.

Jeremiah, then, does not deny that there is a measure of truth in what these prophets say; he only demands a distinct declaration that their dreams are but dreams, and not equal in authority to the Divine word. For, as he continues, <span class="cmt_word">What is the chaff to the wheat</span>? What right have you to mix the worthless chaff with the pure, winnowed grain? How, he implies, can such an adulterated message produce the designed effect of a prophetic revelation? (St. Paul has a somewhat similar figure, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10-13</a>.) So Naegelsbach. Keil, however, denies that there is any thought of an adulteration of the Divine word by the "false prophets." According to him, the question in this verse is simply meant to emphasize the contrast between the false, dream-born prophecy of Jeremiah's opponents and the true revelations. How can the false prophecy pretend to be the true? They are as different as chaff and wheat. Both views are admissible. Naegelsbach introduces a new element by suggesting the intermixture of false and true in the utterances of the "false prophets;" but his view is not inconsistent with what the prophet has stated before, and it is favored by ver. 30 and by the command, <span class="cmt_word">Let him speak my word faithfully</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in its genuine form; comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>, "A faithful or trustworthy [i.e. a genuine] seed;" also, for the general sense, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>.

As in vers. 19, 20, so here, the prophet contrasts the message of the false prophets with that of the true. The former flatter their hearers with promises of peace; the latter speak a stern but potent word, which burns like a fire, and crushes like a hammer. Observe, the prophet does not define the activity of the fire as he does that of the hammer; for the fire has a twofold effect - protection to God's friends and destruction to his enemies. On the figure of the hammer, comp. Jeremiah 1:23; 51:20.

First we are told that the prophets <span class="cmt_word">steal my words every one from his neighbor</span>. The latter part of the phrase reminds us of ver. 27, but the neighbor in this case must mean, at any rate primarily, a fellow-prophet, one who has really received a revelation at first-hand from Jehovah. The "false prophets," not trusting to their "dreams" alone, listen greedily to the discourses of men like Jeremiah, not with a view to spiritual profit, but to making their own utterances more effective. We must remember that they lived by their prophesying (<a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>).

The prophets were accustomed to apply the term <span class="accented">massa</span> to their prophetic declarations in the sense of "oracle," or "utterance" - a sense derived from the use of the cognate verb for "to lift up the voice," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to pronounce clearly and distinctly. But the word <span class="accented">massa</span> was also in common use for "load, burden," and hence the "false prophets" applied the term derisively to Jeremiah's discourses. "Rightly does he call his word a <span class="accented">massa</span>; it is not merely a solemn utterance, but a heavy burden; as De Wette puts it, not merely a <span class="accented">Weissagung</span>, but a <span class="accented">Wehsagung</span>. The passage is important as indicating the sense in which the true prophets understood the term. It should be added that the term mused is prefixed to at least four Biblical passages which, not being of threatening import, do not admit of being entitled "burdens" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-14.htm">Lamentations 2:14</a>).

The received text, however, reads, "and unto Nebuchadnezzar," etc. Neither reading is satisfactory. The latter one is intolerably harsh; the former makes Nebuchadnezzar a mere adjunct of the tribes of the north. In the other passages, moreover, where this king is solemnly entitled "my servant," the clause is the most prominent one in the sentence (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10</a>). The words in question have a sort of family resemblance to the glosses which meet us occasionally both in the form of the Hebrew text represented by the Massoretic recension, and those by the principal ancient versions. The words are omitted by the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">My servant</span>. Generally to be a "servant" of Jehovah or of any supposed deity is to be a worshipper. Thus Daniel is called by Darius, "servant of the living God" (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-20.htm">Daniel 6:20</a>), and thus Abdallah, "servant of Allah," has become a favorite surname of the followers of Mohammed. In the Book of Jeremiah itself (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>), and in Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), "my servant" is the form in which Jehovah addresses his chosen people; and in the second part of Isaiah the suffering Messiah is so styled. Here, however, a foreign king is thus entitled. How is this to be explained? Cyrus, no doubt, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>, 45:1, is called "my shepherd" and "my anointed one;" but then Cyrus, in the view of the prophet, was a genuine though unconscious worshipper of the true God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/41-25.htm">Isaiah 41:25</a>), whereas Nebuchadnezzar was known to be a polytheist and an idolater. We must, therefore, take "servant" to be applied to Nebuchadnezzar in a lower sense than to the other bearers of the title. The Hebrew 'ebbed, in fact, may be either "slave" in something approaching to the terrible modern sense, or in the sense in which Eliezer was one (i.e. little less than a son, and a possible heir, <a href="../../par/genesis/24-2.htm">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>), and which is still in full force in Arabia. <span class="cmt_word">An astonishment</span> (see on Jeremiah 2:11). <span class="cmt_word">An hissing</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-8.htm">Jeremiah 19:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sound of the millstones</span>. Modern travel enables us (so conservative is the East) to realize the full force of this image. The hand-mill is composed of two stones. As a rule, "two women" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>) sit at it facing each other; both have hold of the handle by which the upper is turned round on the 'nether' millstone. The one whose right hand is disengaged throws in the grain as occasion requires, through the hole in the upper stone" (Dr. Thomson). "The labor," remarks Dr. Robinson, "is evidently hard; and the grating sound of the mill is heard at a distance, indicating (like our coffee-mills) the presence of a family and of household life" ('Biblical Researches,' 2:181). <span class="cmt_word">Add to this the light of the candle</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">lamp</span>), and we have two of the most universally characteristic signs of domestic life. No family could dispense with the hand-mill, and, as the sermon on the mount implies, the poorest household had its "lamp" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a> - the poverty of the family is indicated by the various uses to which the lamp-stand was applied). Comp. this verse with the imitation in <a href="../../par/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22, 23</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a></div><div class="verse">And this whole land shall be a desolation, <i>and</i> an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years</span>. Widely different opinions are held as to the meaning of this prophecy. The most probable view is that "seventy" is an indefinite or round number (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>), equivalent to "a very long time." This is supported by the analogy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-7.htm">Jeremiah 27:7</a>, where the captivity is announced as lasting through the reigns of Nebuchadnezzar, his son, and his grandson - a statement evidently vague and indefinite (see <span class="accented">ad</span> loc.), and in any case not answering to a period of seventy years. Besides, we find the "seventy years" again in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>, a passage written probably eleven years later. Others think the number is to be taken literally, and it is certainly true that from  <span class="date">B.C. 606</span>, the fourth year of Jehoiakim, to the fall of Babylon,  <span class="date">B.C. 539</span>, sixty-seven years elapsed. But is it desirable to press this against the internal evidence that Jeremiah himself took the number indefinitely? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, <i>that</i> I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-29.</span> - The judgment upon Judah and the nations. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Perpetual desolations</span>. Thus, too, we read in <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>, that Babylon "shall never be inhabited." There is a dispute between Dr. Keith and Dr. Kay on the one side, and rationalistic commentators (e.g. Kuenen) on the other, whether these prophecies have received a circumstantial fulfillment. The truth is that authorities are not entirely agreed on the area covered by the site of Babylon. General Chesney remarks that, so far from being uninhabited, "A town of considerable population, villages, date groves, and gardens, are found still on the very site of ancient Babylon" (extracts from a private letter in B. W. Newton's 'Babylon: its Revival and Final Desolation,' pp. 38-42). Similarly M. Menant, a veteran French Assyriologist, remarks that "Hillah, according to M. Oppert, was a quarter of Babylon, probably that which was inhabited by the working population, without the precincts of the royal palaces. Numberless traces of ancient habitations indicate this origin of the modern town" ('Babylone,' p. 177). Mr. George Smith, however, in his 'Assyrian Discoveries,' simply states that, "A little to the south rose the town of Hillah," apparently assuming (what is impossible to prove, as the walls of Babylon have not yet been discovered) that Hillah lay just outside the city enclosure. But even he adds that it was "built with the bricks found in the old capital," which is, strictly speaking, inconsistent with the absolute abandonment of the site of Babylon implied in <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20-22</a>. The dispute is an unfortunate one, as it tacitly implies that circumstantial fulfillments are necessary to the veracity of prophecy. The truth seems to lie in the mean between two opposing views. As a rule, the details of a prophetic description cannot be pressed; they are mainly imaginative elaborations of a great central truth or fact. Occasionally, however, regarding the prophecies in the light of gospel times, it is almost impossible not to observe that "the Spirit of Christ which was in" the prophets (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>) has overruled their expressions, so that they correspond more closely to facts than could have been reasonably anticipated. Such superabundant favors to believers in inspiration occur repeatedly in the prophecies respecting Christ. They may, of course, occur elsewhere for a sufficient reason, but we have no right to be surprised if we do not meet with them. The general truth of the prophecy is that the <span class="accented">empire of Babylon</span> shall fall forever. As Dr. Payne Smith remarks, it was practically the work of one man (Nebuchadnezzar), and after his death it only lasted for a few years, during which its history is a series of murders and usurpations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-13.htm">Jeremiah 25:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, <i>even</i> all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will bring</span>, etc. Clearly this verse cannot have formed part of the original prophecy, but must have been added whenever the collection of prophecies against foreign nations finally assumed its present form (see introduction on Jeremiah 50, 51.). It should be mentioned that the Septuagint separates the last clause of the verse, "that which Jeremiah prophesied," etc., and makes it the heading of the group of prophecies against the nations, which in the Hebrew Bible stand at the end of Jeremiah's prophecies, but which, beginning with "Elam," the Alexandrian Version inserts at this point.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thus saith</span>, etc. Out of this verse and the following, to the end of the chapter, the Septuagint makes the thirty-second chapter, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25.htm">Jeremiah 25</a>. being completed by the prophecy against Elam (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34-39</a>). The symbolic act which the prophet is directed to perform is mentioned in order to explain the word of threatening just uttered. So, at least, we must understand it, if we accept the arrangement of the Hebrew text. But the connection is certainly improved if we follow Graf, and omit vers. 11b-14; ver. 15 thus becomes an explanation of the threat against Judah and the other nations in vers. 9-11a. <span class="cmt_word">The wine, up of this fury</span>; or, <span class="accented">this wine-cup of fury</span>. The wine with which the cup is filled is the wrath of God. The figure is not an infrequent one with the prophets and the psalmists (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-7.htm">Jeremiah 51:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-31.htm">Ezekiel 23:31-34</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-16.htm">Habakkuk 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/60-3.htm">Psalm 60:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-16.htm">Jeremiah 25:16</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And be moved, and be mad</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and reel to and fro</span>, <span class="accented">and behave themselves madly</span>. The inspired writers do not scruple to ascribe all phenomena, the "bad" as well as the "good," to a Divine operation. "Shall there be evil in a city, and Jehovah hath not done it?" (<a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>). "An evil spirit from Elohim came upon Saul, and he became frenzied" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; see also <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-14.htm">Isaiah 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-10.htm">Isaiah 29:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19-23</a>, and especially the very remarkable prologue of the Book of Job). To understand this form of expression, we must remember the strength of the reaction experienced by the prophets against the polytheism of the surrounding nations. It was not open to them to account for the existence of evil by ascribing it to the activity of various divinities; they knew Jehovah to be the sole cause in the universe. To us, "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought," such a doctrine occasions "great searchings of heart," and is sometimes a sore trial of our faith. But the prophets were not logicians, and their faith, compared to ours, was as an oak tree to a sapling; hence they can generally (see, however, <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>) express the truth of the universal causation of Jehovah with perfect tranquility. <span class="cmt_word">Because of the sword</span>. Here Jeremiah deserts the figure of the Cup, and, as most commentators think, uses the language of fact. It is not, however, certain that "the sword" means that of God's human instruments; Jehovah himself has a sword (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-10.htm">Jeremiah 46:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-35.htm">Jeremiah 50:35-38</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5</a>; and elsewhere), just as he has a hand (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-11.htm">Isaiah 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1</a>) and an arm (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40-10.htm">Isaiah 40:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>). All these belong to a group of childlike symbolic expressions for the manifestation of the Deity. Jehovah's "sword" is described more fully in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; it "turns hither and thither," like the lightning - a striking figure of the completeness with which God performs his work of vengeance (see also on ver. 27). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-17.htm">Jeremiah 25:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then took I the cup... and made all the nations to drink</span>. It is too pro-sale to suppose either that Jeremiah made a journey to "all the nations," or that he actually went through the form of presenting the cup to the ambassadors who (it is conjectured, comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>b) had come to Jerusalem to take measures against the common foe (so J. D. Michaelis). But the supposition arises (as Keil has well observed) out of an imperfect comprehension of the figure. It is not a cup with wine which the prophet receives from Jehovah, but a wine-cup filled with the wine of God's fury, which wine (one may add) is no more a literal wine than the "sword of Jehovah" is a literal sword. The "making all the nations to drink" is simply a way of expressing the prophet's firm faith that the word of Jehovah will not "return unto him void " - that a prophecy once uttered must fulfill itself; and "sent me," in the last clause, merely means "entrusted me with a message" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-6.htm">Proverbs 26:6</a>). For the fulfillment of this detailed prediction, see on Jeremiah 46-51. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>To wit</i>, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as <i>it is</i> this day;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings thereof</span> (see on Jeremiah 19:3). <span class="cmt_word">As it is this day</span>. As to the meaning of this phrase, see on Jeremiah 11:5. The words evidently presuppose that the prediction has already been fulfilled (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-6.htm">Jeremiah 44:6, 23</a>); consequently, they cannot have stood here in the original draft of the prophecy. An early editor, or even Jeremiah himself, must have inserted them. They are omitted in the Septuagint.

After leaving Judah and Jerusalem, the prophet turns to the far south - to Egypt; then he ascends to the south-east (Uz), and the south-west (the Philistines); thence he passes to the east (Edom, Moab, Ammon); and thence to the west of the Holy Land (Phoenicia). This suggests the maritime lands "beyond the sea" (including especially Cyprus); a sudden transition brings the prophet to the Arabian tribes (Dedan, etc.), from whence he passes by the road of the northeast (Elam, Media) to the indefinitely distant north. Last of all, in solitary grandeur or infamy, Babylon is mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a></div><div class="verse">And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The mingled people</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">V</span>ulgate, <span class="accented">et universes generaliter</span>.

This explanation will account for the use of the word in all the passages in which it occurs (here and in ver. 24; also <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>:37; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a>). The context here and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> seems to imply that the name was given especially to the tribes (probably Bedawin tribes) on the frontier of Judah towards the desert, though in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> it is evidently applied to a people which in some sense belonged to Egypt. In <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a> it may be doubted whether the phrase is used from the point of view of Egypt or of the Israelites; in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a> it is used of the foreigners in Babylon in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-14.htm">2 Chronicles 9:14</a> the Massoretic critics have pointed the consonants of the text wrongly ('<span class="accented">arabh</span>, Arabia, instead of '<span class="accented">erebh</span>), but without injury to the sense; the Vulgate and Syriac have done the same in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>. The notion that the word means ' auxiliary troops" arises (as Thenius on <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> remarks) from the free rendering of the Targum at <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Uz</span>.

A significant phrase, which can be explained from Herodotus (2:157): For twenty-nine years Psamnutichus "pressed the siege of Azotus without intermission."

Whether they axe to be connected with the Zimran of <a href="../../par/genesis/25-2.htm">Genesis 25:2</a> seems doubtful; their locality hardly suits. Elam. Elam, one of the most ancient monarchies in the world (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.), is again coupled with Media in <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>. It was a region on the east of the lower Tigris, bounded westward by Babylonia, northward by Assyria and Media, southward by the Persian Gulf. To say that it is put either here or anywhere else in the Old Testament for the whole of Persia seems a mistake, as the Persians were hardly known before the time of Cyrus.

The truth is that every great serf-manifestation of the Divine Governor of the world is a fresh act in that great drama of which the universal judgment will be the close. Hence the prophets, whose perspective was necessarily limited, seeing the cud but not all that was to precede it, speak as if the end were nearer at hand than it really was. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Sheshach</span>, etc. This clause, however, is omitted in the Septuagint, and is too manifestly the insertion of an unwise copyist or editor. For, though perfectly true that Babylon was to suffer punishment afterwards, it is most inappropriate to mention it here at the end of a list of the nations which Babylon itself was to punish. "Sheshach," it should be explained, is the form assumed by the word "Babylon" in the cypher called Athbash (A  =  T, B  =  SH, etc.). It happens to convey a very appropriate meaning, viz. "humiliation" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>). A similar instance of cypher allegory occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-1.htm">Jeremiah 51:1</a>. "Sheshach" occurs again in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-41.htm">Jeremiah 51:41</a>, where, however, it is omitted by the Septuagint. [Dr. Lauth, of Munich, thinks that Sheshach is equivalent to Sisku, the name of a district in Babylonia; but the reading Sisku is uncertain.

The priests and the prophets interfere, arrest Jeremiah, and accuse him of a capital crime.

Besides, were not the majority of the prophets of Jehovah of entirely another way of thinking? Did they not promise peace? And what could justify Jeremiah in announcing not merely war, but the downfall of the Divine habitation itself? Hence no sooner had the prophet concluded his discourse, than he was arrested, accused, and condemned to death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-8.htm">Jeremiah 26:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded <i>him</i> to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Had made an end of speaking</span>. They allowed Jeremiah to finish his discourse (of which we have here only the briefest summary), either from a lingering reverence for his person and office, or to obtain fuller materials for an accusation (comp. the trial of Stephen, <a href="../../par/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12-14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">All the people</span>. The "people" appear to have been always under some constraint.

In ver. 16 princes and people together go over to the side of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die</span>. Death was the legal penalty both for blasphemy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>) and for presuming to prophesy without having received a prophetic revelation (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>). Jeremiah's declaration ran so entirely counter to the prejudices of his hearers that he may well have been accused of both these sins, or crimes. True, Isaiah and Amos had already predicted the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-5.htm">Isaiah 5:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-11.htm">Isaiah 6:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-4.htm">Amos 2:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1, 2</a>); but it may have been contended that the timely repentance of Judah under Hezekiah and Josiah had effectually cancelled the threatened doom, and though <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-10.htm">Isaiah 64:10, 11</a> evidently refers to a time later than Josiah, and represents the ruin of Jerusalem as practically certain, it would seem that the prophetic book (<a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>.) to which this belongs (to say the least) was not generally known.

The whole verse is thoroughly technical in its phraseology. The word (<span class="accented">qahal</span>) rendered "assembly" is the traditional legal term for the "congregation of Israel" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-30.htm">Deuteronomy 31:30</a>); comp. ver. 9, where the verb is the corresponding one to <span class="accented">qahal</span>. Thus, with all the faults of the government of Judah, which Jeremiah himself reveals to us, it was very far removed from the Oriental despotisms of our day. The "elders" are still an important element in the social system, and form a link with that earlier period in which the family was the leading power in the social organization. Originally the term denoted, strictly and in the full sense, heads of families; they have their  analogue in the councils of the Aryan village communities. "References to their parliamentary status (if the phrase may be used) occur in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>.

The case is similar to that of certain passages in St. John's Gospel, where the reflections of the evangelist are put side by side with the sayings of our <span class="accented">Lord</span>. Jeremiah, writing down his experiences at a later time, introduces the story of Urijah to show the magnitude of the danger to which he had been exposed.

From <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> it appears that the term indicates a position of high command in the army, which is in accordance with the notice in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Went into Egypt</span>.

The latter, however, proved to be not a safe asylum for Urijah, as Pharaoh was the liege lord of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>), and the extradition of Urijah as a criminal naturally followed.

The Syriao substitutes for, "Jehoiakim" "Zedekiah," to bring the passage into conformity with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>, where the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah is expressly mentioned. But is this emendation sufficient? Can the fourth year be called the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah," When that reign lasted altogether only eleven years? Is it not probable that the transcriber has inadvertently copied the heading of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>, which corresponds verbally with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-1.htm">Jeremiah 27:1</a>, except that "unto Jeremiah" is wanting? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Make thee bends and yokes</span>; rather, bands <span class="accented">and poles</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the bands which secured the two pieces of wood placed respectively above and beneath the neck of the ox, so forming a yoke. Hence, in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, we find the phrase, "the poles [Authorized Version wrongly, 'the bands'] of your yoke." It is clear from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-10.htm">Jeremiah 28:10</a> that this account is to be taken literally. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And send them</span>, etc. The letter of the text certainly suggests that Jeremiah actually delivered a separate yoke to each of the five ambassadors. Some commentators, however, finding such an act almost incredible, suppose the statement to be allegorical, and the "sending of the yoke" to mean the declaration of the subjection of the nations to Nebuchadnezzar which follows, somewhat as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a> the "causing all the nations to drink "means the utterance of a prophecy of woe to the various peoples concerned. But we can hardly pronounce upon this passage by itself. We have to consider whether a whole group of similar statements is or is not to be taken literally. It may be enough to instance <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Which come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">which are come</span>.

Therefore he can give any part of it to whomsoever he will. Therefore, Jeremiah being his trustworthy prophet, the kings are called upon to take notice that Jehovah has transferred their kingdoms to Nebuchadnezzar. Observe, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27.htm">Jeremiah 27-29</a>. the form employed is not "Nebuchadnezzar," but "Nebuchadnezzar" (so also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-1.htm">Jeremiah 34:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>). (See on Jeremiah 21:7.)

This is intelligible only if the seventy years predicted by Jeremiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11, 12, 29</a>:10, are a round number. Nebuchadnezzar died in  <span class="date">B.C. 561</span>, and was succeeded by his son Evil-Merodach, who, after two years, was put to death by Neriglissar. In  <span class="date">B.C. 555</span> Laberosoarchod (?) became king, but after nine months a usurper belonging to another family, Nabonedus or Nabunita, ascended the throne, which he occupied till  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, the year of the fall of Babylon. "Seventy years," taken literally, only brings us to  <span class="date">B.C. 555</span>, seventeen years short of the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus. <span class="cmt_word">Until the very time of his land come</span>; rather, <span class="accented">until the time of his own land</span> come.

So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a> the "dreams" of the people are expressly distinguished from the utterances of the prophets and soothsayers. In our passage the "dreamers" are appropriately mentioned between the "diviners" and the "enchanters," because the skill of the soothsayers partly lay in the interpretation of dreams (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>).

The plural is used, for Zedekiah was but an individual among a number of much more vigorous personalities (comp. on Jeremiah 22:2).

The last four verses of this section appear in a much shortened form in the Septuagint, and it must be admitted that the description is singularly lengthy. It is, therefore, quite conceivable that this is one of the cases in which the Hebrew text has been disfigured by willful interpolation. On the other hand, it is also possible that the description was filled out by an editor, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Baruch, conscientiously for the benefit of later readers. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vessels of the Lord's house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the golden vessels which Solomon had made, and which Nebuchadnezzar had taken away (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-13.htm">2 Kings 24:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Now shortly</span>. These words are wanting in the Septuagint, and, considering that the Greek is also without the prediction in ver. 22, that the vessels of the temple and of the palace should be brought back in the day of visitation (which seems inconsistent with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-17.htm">Jeremiah 52:17</a>), the question arises whether the words "now shortly" here are not due to a hasty copyist.

Seeing that a part of the sacred vessels had been carried to Babylon, ell true prophets ought to intercede with Jehovah that those still left might be spared.

It seems strange that the fourth year of a reign which only lasted eleven years in all should be called "the beginning. Is it not probable that the clause was interpolated here by a later copyist on account of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-1.htm">Jeremiah 27:1</a>, where at present a similar clause (see note) is found? Originally placed in the margin as a gloss upon the words "the same year," it would very easily find its way into the text. <span class="cmt_word">Hananiah... the prophet</span> (see on ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Gibeon</span>. This was a priestly city (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-17.htm">Joshua 21:17</a>), so that Hananiah was probably himself a priest like Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-1.htm">Jeremiah 1:1</a>) and Pashur (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>). The modern El Jib, on an isolated, rocky hill, doubtless represents the ancient Gibeon. <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of the priests and of all the people</span>. Apparently the event took place on either a new moon or a Sabbath, when the people would throng to the temple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-2.htm">Jeremiah 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Hananiah opens his prophecy with the usual formula, claiming Divine inspiration in the fullest sense. His message is short and sweet: <span class="cmt_word">I have broken</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I have decreed to break (the perfect of prophetic certitude) - <span class="cmt_word">the yoke of the king of Babylon</span>. Had Hananiah stopped here, he might, perhaps, have escaped Jeremiah's indignant rebuke. But with light-hearted arrogance he ventures to fix a time close at hand for the event, which, no doubt, was destined to occur, but after a long interval. Dr. Payne Smith suggests that he probably cherished the belief that the confederacy then on foot (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-3.htm">Jeremiah 27:3</a>) would defeat Nebuchadnezzar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a></div><div class="verse">Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon:</div><div class="comm">

Jeconiah</span>. Hananiah thus directly contradicts the assurance of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-26.htm">Jeremiah 22:26, 27</a>) that Jehoiachin would not return, but would die in a foreign land. Has he a political object in his favorable prognostication for the deposed king? Does he, in short, belong to a Jehoiachin party opposed to the friends of Zedekiah? The view is possible, and may seem to be confirmed by the emphatic repetition of the fall of Nebuchadnezzar, the liege lord of Zedekiah. Still there is evidence enough in modern history that the return of an exile is not necessarily tantamount to his reinstatement in his office. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-5.htm">Jeremiah 28:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - Jeremiah's reply. He heartily wishes that Hananiah's prediction were capable of fulfillment, but it runs directly counter to the declarations of all the older prophets. "War, and evil, and pestilence" was their constant burden, for the people to whom they prophesied were unworthy of the golden age of felicity in which the prophets so firmly believed. Only by a terrible judgment could the people of Israel be purified for the Messianic age. This appears to be what Jeremiah means by ver. 8. True, he speaks of "countries" and "kingdoms" in the plural, but all the great prophets include the nations best known to them within the range of their preaching, and even of their Messianic preaching. Isaiah, for instance, threatens sore judgment upon Egypt and Assyria, and yet he holds out the cheering prospect that Egypt and Assyria will have a part in the Messianic felicity. Thus Hananiah's prediction has probabilities very strongly against it He not only prophesies "peace,' but attaches no condition to his promise, which, therefore, has double need of verification by the event (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>).

Jeremiah meekly suffers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-11.htm">Jeremiah 28:11</a></div><div class="verse">And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-13.htm">Jeremiah 28:13</a></div><div class="verse">Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The yokes of wood</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">yoke of wood</span>. The word rendered in the Authorized Version" yokes" means properly "poles," two of which, with the "bands," composed a "yoke" (see on Jeremiah 27:2). <span class="cmt_word">But thou shalt make</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but</span> thou hast made. The sense in which Hananiah is said to have made "a yoke of iron" (we should render in the singular) comes out in ver. 14. The point is that there was a certain justification for Hananiah's violent act, but not that which he supposed. Jeremiah's wooden yoke was really an inadequate symbol; the prophet was too tender to his people. Thus God made the truth appear in still fuller brightness from the very perverseness of its enemy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-14.htm">Jeremiah 28:14</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The beasts of the field</span> (see on Jeremiah 27:6).

In one sense Hananiah was a prophet as much as Jeremiah. He claimed to have received the prophetic call, and God alone, who searcheth the heart, could pronounce upon the justice of his claim. Whatever training was regarded as necessary for the office he had probably gone through, and now for a number of years he had been universally recognized as a member of the prophetic class. Probably he had those natural gifts, including a real, though dim and not unerring, "second sight," which seems to have formed the substratum of Old Testament prophecy; but he certainly had not the moral backbone so conspicuous in Jeremiah, and he lacked that intimate communion with God (this became dear on the present occasion) which alone warranted the assurance that "Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath sent me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-16.htm">Jeremiah 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will east thee</span>; rather, I song <span class="accented">thee away</span>. Possibly, as Hitzig suggests, there is an allusion to the preceding verse, in which the same verb occurs. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast taught rebellion</span>; literally, <span class="accented">thou hast spoken turning aside</span>. To "speak turning aside (or, 'rebellion')" is a phrase of Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6</a>), where it is used, as here, of opposition, not to Jehovah, but to revealed truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Great excitement had been caused among the so-called prophets in Babylon by the emphatic language of Jeremiah. Accordingly one of them, named Shemaiah, wrote letters to the Jews at home, and especially to a high official called Zephaniah (see on ver. 26) to put a stop to Jeremiah's bold agitation. Zephaniah, however, was not the man for whom Shemaiah took him, and read the letter to the intended victim. Upon this, Jeremiah received a special revelation, announcing dire punishment to Shemaiah and his family (according to the principle of the Divine government described in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Shemaiah</span>; or, <span class="accented">of</span>, <span class="accented">concerning</span> (as the same preposition is rendered in vers. 16, 21, 31). The oracle itself speaks of Shemaiah in the third person (vers. 31, 32). The Authorized Version, however, can be defended by its accordance with ver. 25. <span class="cmt_word">The Nehelamite</span>. This is evidently a patronymic, but whether of the family or the locality of the bearer cannot be decided.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-25.htm">Jeremiah 29:25</a></div><div class="verse">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that <i>are</i> at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-26.htm">Jeremiah 29:26</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man <i>that is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the stead of Jehoiada the priest</span>. Some (Grotius, Hitzig, Graf) think that this Jehoiada was the famous high priest of that name, who is said to have "appointed <span class="accented">officers</span> over the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a>). It is true that Zephaniah was not literally the successor of Jehoiada, but he was so in the same metaphorical sense in which the scribes are said by our Lord to "sit in Moses' seat" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2</a>). It is safer, however, to suppose that another Jehoiada is meant, of whom we have no further information. It is not said that either Jehoiada or Zephaniah was high priest, and as the special object of the elevation of the latter is said to be the supervision of the temple police, it is more probable that Jehoiada and he were successively "second priests," or, to use a phrase which seems to be synonymous, "deputy governors in the house of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-1.htm">Jeremiah 20:1</a>). The passage may thus without violence be harmonized with <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-24.htm">Jeremiah 52:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, where Seraiah is called "the chief priest" and Zephaniah "the second priest." It is possible that Jehoiada 'had been favorable to the better class of prophets. In this case there will be a delicate hint to Zephaniah that God had his own purpose in promoting him to honor, viz. that unruly prophets like Jeremiah might be held in with a tighter hand (Ewald). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should be officers</span>; rather, that <span class="accented">there should be officers</span>. Zephaniah himself was an "officer" or "deputy" (see above); but he was also "chief in the house of the Lord," and had the appointment of inferior "officers," whose duty it was to preserve order in the temple. To understand the following words, we must remember that the outer court of the temple was a favorite place for prophetic teaching (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to keep an eye upon "madmen" and prophetizers. The term "mad" is used in a disparaging sense (as <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-11.htm">2 Kings 9:11</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>), with regard to the apparently senseless behavior of those who were overpowered by the spirit of prophecy. In earlier times, no doubt, the phenomena of prophecy were more violently opposed to everyday life than in Jeremiah's time; but such symbolic acts as appearing in public with a yoke upon his neck would at least excuse the application of the epithet even to Jeremiah. It is more than probable, however, that it was not so much the abnormal actions as the contents of Jeremiah's prophecies which stirred up such vehement opposition; observe how in the next verse only the sound of these descriptive nouns is retained ("which maketh himself a prophet"). It was the making prophecy a reality which disturbed the men of routine, and Shemaiah well knew this when he made this appeal to Zephaniah. There was no harm in being nominally a "prophet," but to "make," or rather, "show one's self as a prophet," to be an energetic prophet, a prophetizer (if the word may be invented), - this was wormwood to those who cried, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace. <span class="cmt_word">In prison, and in the stocks</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the stocks</span> (see on Jeremiah 20:2) <span class="accented">and in the collar</span>.

But the context, which dwells so strongly on the oblivion into which the Divine benefits had been allowed to pass, is decidedly in favor of the first view. How beautiful is this condescending language! Jehovah's past feelings come Back to him; at least, so it appears to the believer, when God lets the light of his countenance shine forth again (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-20.htm">Jeremiah 31:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>). He even condescends to overlook the weakness and inconsistency of the Israel of antiquity. He idealizes it (i.e. Jeremiah is permitted to do so). This is in harmony with other prophetic passages (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a> ("as at the first"); <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-6.htm">Ezekiel 16:6-14</a>).

The speaker is evidently the prophet, who exclaims in surprise at the view which his prophetic insight opens to him: "quasi de re nova et absurda sciscitatur" (Calvin). For Israel is a member of Jehovah's family; he is not a servant (except in the same high sense as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-53</a>, where "servant" is virtually equivalent to "representative"), but rather in the highest degree a free man, for he is Jehovah's "firstborn son" (<a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). How is it, then, that he is dragged away into captivity like a slave who has never known freedom? The view of some, that "servant" means "servant of Jehovah" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-10.htm">Jeremiah 30:10</a>), and that the question therefore is to be answered in the affirmative, is less natural. "Servant," by itself, never has this turning; and there is a precisely similar term in the discourse at ver. 31, where the negative answer of the question does not admit of a doubt.

Baldness was a great mark of disgrace (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>). There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18-20</a>, where, in punishment of the negotiations of Ahaz with Assyria, the prophet threatens an invasion of Judah both by Assyria and by Egypt: and employs the very. same figure (see ver. 20). So here, the devastation threatened by Jeremiah is the punishment of the unhallowed coquetting with the Egyptian power of which the Jewish rulers had been recently guilty. The fact which corresponds to this prediction is the defeat of Josiah at Megiddo, and the consequent subjugation of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>).

Obviously this does not harmonize with the rendering "I have broken," etc., in the first clause (unless, with Dr. Payne Smith, we explain "I will not serve" as virtually equivalent to "I will still serve my idol-gods"); hence the Jewish critics, by just adding a <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>), changed "serve" into "transgress."

The sacred writers are never afraid of its palling on the ear by repetition (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-9.htm">Jeremiah 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-2.htm">Isaiah 27:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A right seed</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a vine-shoot of the genuine sort. "Seed" for "shoot," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-11.htm">Isaiah 17:11</a> (scrap. ver. 10). <span class="cmt_word">The degenerate plant</span>; rather, <span class="accented">degenerate shoots</span> (if at least the text is right). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-22.htm">Jeremiah 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, <i>yet</i> thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - Nitre does not mean the substance which now bears that name, but "natron," a mineral alkali, deposited on the shores and on the bed of certain lakes in Egypt, especially those in the Wady Nat-run (the ancient Nitria, whence came so large a store of precious Syriac manuscripts). In ancient times, this natron was collected to make lye from for washing purposes (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-20.htm">Proverbs 25:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sope</span>; rather, potash; the corresponding vegetable alkali (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thine iniquity is marked</span>. So Kimchi and Gesenius (through a doubtful etymology); but the Aramaic use of the word favors the rendering <span class="accented">stained</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. filthy. The word is in the participle, to indicate the permanence of the state (comp. "Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood," etc.? 'Macbeth'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-23.htm">Jeremiah 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: <i>thou art</i> a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How canst thou say</span>, etc.? This is not a mere rhetorical fiction equivalent to "or if thou shouldst perhaps say," but probably represents an objection really made by the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judah. Their fault was not in neglecting the public worship of Jehovah in his appointed temple, but in superadding to this, idolatrous rites inconsistent with the spiritual religion taught by Jeremiah. The people did not, it seems, regard this as tantamount to "following Baalim," just as some converts to Christianity in our own foreign missions might exclaim against being accused of apostasy, because they secretly carry on certain heathen practices. The prophet, however, applies a more rigorous test to their conduct. <span class="cmt_word">Baalim</span>; the plural of Baal, used for "other gods" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-16.htm">Jeremiah 1:16</a>; comp. on ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Thy way in the valley</span>. <span class="accented">The valley</span> in this context can only be that of Hinnom (see on Jeremiah 7:31), which from the time of Ahaz had been defiled with the rites of "Moloch, horrid king" (see ' Paradise Lost,' 1:392-396). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art a swift dromedary</span>. Ewald would attach this half of the verse to ver. 24; and there is something to be said for this plan. <span class="accented">Swift dromedary</span> is, properly speaking, in the vocative. The ardor of the people for idolatry is expressed by the comparison of it to the uncontrollable instinct of brute beasts. The word rendered "dromedary" is in the feminine gender; it means strictly the young she-camel which has not yet had a foal. <span class="cmt_word">Traversing her ways</span>; rather, <span class="accented">interlacing her ways</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. running backwards and forwards at the impulse of passion.

Umbreit's view, however, is far more natural. "God the true husband exhorts Israel not to run barefoot, and with parched throat, like a shameless adulteress, after strangers" (Payne Smith). There is no hops; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the exhortation is in vain (so <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-12.htm">Jeremiah 18:12</a>).

True, Manasseh's reactionary reign had intervened, but his counter-movement would not have been so successful had it not been attended by the good wishes of the people; and besides, the last years of Manasseh, according to the tradition in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-16</a> were devoted to undoing the mischief of his former life. The force of the prophet's words is strikingly brought out by M. Renan (he led an expedition to Phoenicia), who has shown that every district and every town had a cultus of its own, which often only differed from the neighboring cultus by words and titles (<span class="accented">nomina</span>, <span class="accented">numina</span>); comp. Baal-Hamon, Baal-Hazor, eta Dr. Payne Smith well expresses the argument of Jeremiah: "When every city has its special deity, surely among so many there might be found one able to help his worshippers."

The cities and towns of Judah are represented as so many mothers, and the populations as their children. It would, no doubt, be more natural to take "children" literally; but then we must read the verb in the next clause, "Ye have received," as the Septuagint actually renders. In the former case the "smiting" will refer to all God's "sore judgments" -sword, drought, famine, pestilence; in the latter, to the loss of life in battle. <span class="cmt_word">Your own sword hath devoured your prophets</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-21.htm">2 Chronicles 24:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). Manasseh's persecution (which extended, according to Josephus, especially to the prophets) may  account for the preponderance of "false prophets" referred to in ver. 8 (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-29.htm">Matthew 23:29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a></div><div class="verse">O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O generation, see ye</span>. It is doubtful whether <span class="accented">generation</span> here means "contemporaries" (equivalent to "men of this generation"), or, like <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;</span> sometimes in the New Testament, a class of men united by moral affinity (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/14-5.htm">Psalm 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-8.htm">Psalm 78:8</a>). In the latter case we should rather attach the pronoun in "see ye" <span class="accented">to</span> "O generation," and render "O (evil) generation that ye are!" So Hitzig, Keil, and Payne Smith; Ewald and Delitzsch adopt the first rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Have I been a wilderness</span>, etc.? "Have I not been the source of light and happiness to my people, and of all temporal blessings?" (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>). So the Divine speaker in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>, "I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain," or more literally, "in chaos" (same word as in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>); "chaos" and "the wilderness" are both images of that which is utterly unremunerative. <span class="cmt_word">A land of darkness</span>. This is, of course, not literally accurate as a description of the Arabian desert. "Darkness" is here used as a synonym for "misery." Cloud and rain occupy precisely opposite places in the estimation of nomadic and agricultural peoples respectively. "The Bedouins," says an Arabic scholast, "always follow the rain and the places where raindrops fall;" whereas a townsman of Mecca calls himself "child of the sun." So Indra and Varuna, originally belonging to the cloudy and rainy sky, are in the Vedic hymns endowed with solar traits. It should be added here that it is an old problem, and too difficult a one for us to investigate, whether we should render "the darkness of Jah" (Jehovah) or (as Authorized Version) simply "darkness." The former rendering will mean very great darkness, such as Jehovah sends in judgment (e.g. to the Egyptians, <a href="../../par/exodus/10-21.htm">Exodus 10:21-23</a>). On this question, see Dr. Ginsburg on <a href="../../par/songs/8-6.htm">Song of Solomon 8:6</a> (where a similar doubt exists), Geiger's 'Urschrift und Uebersetzungen der Bibel,' p. 276; Ewald, 'Lehrbuch der Hebraischen Sprache,' &sect; 270 e. <span class="cmt_word">We are lords</span>; rather, <span class="accented">we have broken loose</span>. It is, however, a difficult word, which only occurs elsewhere in Genesis 26:40; <a href="../../par/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-3.htm">Psalm 55:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-32.htm">Jeremiah 2:32</a></div><div class="verse">Can a maid forget her ornaments, <i>or</i> a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or a bride her attire</span>. The prophet perhaps means the magnificently adorned girdle which the bride wore on her wedding day (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>). But the word only occurs again in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-20.htm">Isaiah 3:20</a>, and its precise signification is uncertain.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-34.htm">Jeremiah 2:34</a></div><div class="verse">Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also in thy skirts</span>, etc.; or, <span class="accented">there is even fennel in thy skirts</span> (or, perhaps, <span class="accented">in thy sleeves</span> - the wide sleeves of an Eastern mantle). The fact which follows is adduced as the crowning evidence of wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Blood of the souls</span> is explained by the statement in <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, "The soul of the flesh [i.e. of the body] is in the blood;" hence the importance of the blood in the Mosaic sacrifices. The historical reference of this passage of Jeremiah may well be to the persecution of Manasseh, who is said to have "shed innocent blood very much" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>). It is Judah, no doubt, who is addressed, but the prophets mostly assume the "solidarity" of king and people (analogous to that of a forefather and his posterity); Manasseh, moreover, probably had the support of a large section of the population, at any rate in so far as he favored the inveterate cultus of the high places or local sanctuaries. <span class="cmt_word">I have not found it by secret search</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou hast not found them breaking through</span> (<span class="accented">houses</span>). The phraseology agrees with that of <a href="../../par/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>, the law against "breaking through;" it suggests that the houses of all but the highest class in ancient as well as often in modern Palestine, were made of mere sun-dried brick, which could be easily "dug into" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19, 20</a>, in the Greek). [Lieut. Conder states, it is true, that in hilly districts of Palestine the houses of the villages are built of stone, but he adds that the stone is simply taken from the ruins of the ancient towns.] Burglars caught in the act might be killed (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2</a>), but the innocent victims of persecution could not be brought under this category, and hence those who slew them were really guilty of murder. <span class="cmt_word">But upon all these</span>; rather, <span class="accented">but because of all these things</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. not for any crime, but because of thine things," as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-7.htm">Jeremiah 3:7</a>); so Hitzig, Keil Payne Smith; less naturally De Dieu, "because of those false gods" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-35.htm">Jeremiah 2:35</a></div><div class="verse">Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me.

This "because" is misleading; there is no argument, but the statement of a supposed fact.

Judah had so long been undisturbed by any foreign power, that the people fancied the promises of Deuteronomy were being fulfilled, and that they, on their part, had pleased God by their formal obedience (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-17.htm">2 Kings 22:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will plead with thee</span>. Here, as in some other passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>), the word includes the sense of punishing.

The "way" or policy of Judah was "changed," according as the party in power favored an Egyptian or an Assyrian alliance. <span class="cmt_word">Thou also shalt be ashamed of</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou shalt also be brought to shame through</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>As thou art ashamed of Assyria</span> (correct rendering as before). This is certainly difficult, for in the reign of Josiah it would appear that the political connection with Assyria still continued, Is it possible that Jeremiah, in these words, has in view rather the circumstances of Jehoiakim than those of Josiah? Does he not appear to look back upon Judah's final "putting to shame through Assyria" as a thing of the past? And to what event can this expression refer but to the overthrow of Josiah at Megiddo (so Graf)?

Observe, the discourse was to be written down at once, without having been delivered orally; it was to be laid up as a pledge that God would interpose for his people (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-8.htm">Isaiah 30:8</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2, 3</a>).

Graf, in controverting Hitzig's view, points out, however, that the expressions referred to by Hitzig as "Deutero-Isaianic," are also found in other books besides the latter part of Isaiah, and that, on the other hand, "the expressions of ver. 11 are all as foreign to <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, as they are current in Jeremiah." As for the expression, "my servant Jacob." (which. only occurs again in Jeremiah in the duplicate of this passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-27.htm">Jeremiah 46:27, 28</a>, and which is specially characteristic of the second part of Isaiah), it is worth noticing that it is found once in the Book of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>), which, on Hitzig's theory, was written before the so called Second Isaiah. It still remains for the student to consider whether these two verses are not an insertion by some later hand (without attempting to discover whose that hand was). That the prophetic writings have received additions from editors and scribes is a fact which cannot reasonably be gainsaid, supported as it is by the phenomena of the historical books. It would be very natural for a pious Jew in the Captivity, not wholly devoid himself of the spirit of prophecy, to encourage his people, in the Name of the Lord, with this glowing word of promise.

It is remarkable that no reference is made here to the Messiah, who, in fact, is not as conspicuous a figure in the prophecies of Jeremiah as in those of Isaiah. And yet even in Isaiah there is one  striking prophecy in which the inspired seer uses language not (in the hands of a literalist) reconcilable with the prospect of the personal Messiah. The Messiah appears, as it were, in a lightning flash, and then disappears for a time. The prophecy of Isaiah referred to is <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1, 2</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17</a>), in which the prospect of a truly God-fearing king, with princes of the same high character, entirely occupies the mind of the writer.

Hence the finding grace in the wilderness cannot refer to the sequel of the passage through the Red Sea, and we must perforce explain it of the second great deliverance, viz. from the Babylonian exile. This view is strongly confirmed by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-50.htm">Jeremiah 51:50</a>, where the Israelites who escape the predicted slaughter at Babylon are called "escaped ones from the sword," and exhorted to remember Jehovah and Jerusalem "afar off." The "wilderness" of the present passage, like the "afar off" of ch. 51. (and of the next verse) seems to mean Babylon, which was, by comparison with the highly favoured Judah, a "barren and dry land" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>), a spiritual Arabia. It may be objected that the tense here is the perfect; but there is abundance of analogy for explaining it as the prophetic perfect. The restoration of the chosen people to favour is as certain in the Divine counsels as if it were already an event past.

Not with reference to the physical elevation of Jerusalem, for the phrase, "to go up," is used of an army withdrawing from Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>). This seems to indicate that the term was sometimes used in a weakened sense, to which parallels might easily be given.

The question arises how this prediction is to be reconciled with facts. For, as Kimchi has remarked, we find no reference to miracles performed for the Jews who returned from Babylon. A twofold reply seems admissible. We may say either that to those who enjoy a vivid sense of the favour and protection of God no trial is grievous, no circumstances exclude an undercurrent of joy (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>.); or that the prophecy is still waiting for its complete fulfilment, Israel having still a great future reserved for it upon its recognition of the true Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">In a straight way;</span> or, <span class="accented">in an even way, i.e.</span> one free from hindrances. Comp. Ezra's prayer (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>), and <a href="../../par/psalms/107-7.htm">Psalm 107:7</a>, in both of which passages "right" should probably be "even." Ephraim is my firstborn. It is doubted whether this simply means that Ephraim (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> North Israel) shall be in no respect inferior to Judah - a strong form of expression being chosen, on account of the longer continuance of Ephraim's captivity; or whether it implies a restoration to the tribes of Joseph of the prerogative conferred upon the sons of Joseph (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1, 2</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>). The former view seems hardly consistent with the dignity of a prophetic writer. "Forms of expression,"  <span class="accented">i.e.</span> rhetorical phrases, may be admitted in poetical passages, but hardly in solemn prophetic revelations. It was true that Judah had "prevailed above his brethren;" but the original "gift of God" to Ephraim was "without repentance." With regard to the fulfilment of this prediction, we must remember that the remnant of the northern tribes whose faith was strong enough to induce them to profit by the edict of Cyrus, was smaller than that of the southern. Hence the outward signs of God's favour to Ephraim could not be so great as they would have been had the moral conditions of the fulfilment of the promise been more fully complied with.

Jeremiah says that his eye 'shall run down with tears, because the flock of Jehovah is carried away captive' (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>). The change in the fortunes of the Jews is compared by the prophets to a shepherd's seeking his lost sheep, and feeding them again in green pastures (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-10.htm">Jeremiah 31:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11-16</a>). The reference is not so much to the homeward journey of the exiles as to the state of temporal and spiritual happiness in which they would find themselves on their return. The same figures occur in a psalm, where a reference to the return from exile is excluded by the pre-exile date, '... feed them also, and carry them forever' (<a href="../../par/psalms/28-9.htm">Psalm 28:9</a>)" (from the writer's note on Isaiah 40:11).

The land of Ephraim is orphaned and desolate. The prophet seems to hear Rachel weeping for her banished children, and comforts her with the assurance that they shall yet be restored. For Ephraim has come to repentance, and longs for reconciliation with his God, and God, who has overheard his soliloquy, relents, and comes to meet him with gracious promises. Then another voice is heard summoning Ephraim to prepare for his journey home. This verse is quoted by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-17.htm">Matthew 2:17</a>) with reference to the massacre of the innocents, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> prefixed. The latter formula of itself suggests that there was a previous fulfilment of the prophecy, but that the analogy of the circumstances of the innocents justifies - nay, requires - the admission of a second fulfilment. In fact, the promise of the Messianic age seemed in as much danger of being rendered void when Herod wreaked his fury on the children of Bethlehem, as when the tribes of Israel were scattered in exile. Dean Stanley finds a geographical inconsistency in the two passages. "The context of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> implies that the Ramah of the prophet was in the northern kingdom, probably Ramah of Benjamin. The context of <a href="../../par/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, on the other hand, implies that the Ramah of the evangelist was within sight of Bethlehem" ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 225). But this remark involves the assumption that the quotation was not intended merely as an application. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A voice was heard;</span> rather, <span class="accented">is heard.</span> It is a participle, indicating the continuance of the action. <span class="cmt_word">In Ramah.</span> In the neighbourhood of which town Rachel was buried, according to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> ("the city" where Samuel and Saul were - <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a> - appears to have been Ramah). <span class="cmt_word">Rachel weeping for her children.</span> Rachel ("Rahel" is only a Germanizing way of writing the name), being the ancestress of the three tribes, Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin, is represented as feeling like a mother for all the tribes connected with those three. Her "weeping" is no mere figure of speech. Jeremiah believes that the patriarchs and holy men of old continue to feel an interest in the fortunes of their descendants (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-16.htm">Jeremiah 31:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Rachel is admonished to cease from weeping, because her work has not  really been in vain; her children shall be restored. <span class="cmt_word">Thy work shall be rewarded.</span> Like the Servant of the Lord, Rachel had said (though with the voiceless language of tears), "I have laboured in vain; I have spent my strength for nought and in vain;" and like the ocean mother of Zidon, "I have not travailed, nor brought forth children, neither nourished up young men, nor brought up virgins" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>).

But in the spirit of St. Matthew, we may fill the passage with a higher meaning, of which the prophet (like Shakespeare sometimes) was unconscious, namely, "from death;" and the passage thus becomes an undesigned prophecy of the Resurrection.

The word rendered "waymarks" occurs again in 2 Kings 33:17 and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-15.htm">Ezekiel 39:15</a>.

A passage in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/84-6.htm">Psalm 84:6</a>) will occur to every one, in which a psalmist, longing at a distance for the services of the temple, pronounces blessed the man "in whose heart are the highways [to Zion];" here, it is true, "heart" has the double meaning of "mind" and "affections," but "highway" has almost exactly the same sense as in the passage before us. <span class="cmt_word">To these thy cities</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a></div><div class="verse">How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou go about?</span> We must suppose the Israelites to be hesitating whether to set out on their journey or not. They are now admonished to put away their rebellious reluctance, and a special reason for this is added. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath created</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> hath decreed to create - <span class="cmt_word">a new thing in the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">in the land</span>); comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a> which suggests that a complete reversal of ordinary experience is indicated, as indeed the word create of itself prepares us to expect. And what is this promise granted as a sign to reluctant Israel? <span class="cmt_word">A woman shall compass a man;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> instead  of shyly keeping aloof, or worse (as hitherto), Israel, Jehovah's bride, shall, with eager affection, press around her Divine husband. The phrase, however, is extremely difficult. Of other explanations, the most plausible philologically is that of Schnurrer and Gesenius, "a woman shall protect a man" (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>). The part of a sentinel, pacing round and round his charge, seems most unfitted for a woman. When enemies are abroad, it is the men's natural duty to perform this part for the women. But in the coming age, the country shall be so free from danger that the places of men and women may safely be reversed. But would a paradox of this kind be likely to be uttered in this connection? Surely a clearer statement would be necessary to remove the reluctance of the Israelites. Vers. 19, 20 suggest that Ephraim needed reassurance as to the attitude of Jehovah towards him. The promise of ver. 22, as explained above, would give precisely the needed strength and comfort. The exposition of St. Jerome and other Fathers, that the birth of Christ from a virgin is referred to, is altogether inadmissible, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> because the nouns which form the subject and the predicate respectively indicate sex, not age, and the first in particular cannot be tortured so as to mean "virgin;" and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is no article to confine the reference to any particular persons.

Jeremiah puts this more forcibly than the Authorized Version represents.

That Jehovah is meant is not an admissible view. A weak believer may say complainingly, "Why sleepest thou?" but God himself cannot be represented under the image of a sleeper. There seems, however, to be no reason why the prophet should not have used this language. The doubt is whether a real, physical sleep is meant, or merely an ecstatic condition resembling sleep. Hengstenberg decides for the latter. But there is no parallel for sleep in the sense of ecstasy, and, on the other hand, there is evidence enough for dreams as the channels of Divine revelation (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-2.htm">1 Kings 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). As Naegelsbach points out, this is the only unqualifiedly comforting prophecy in the whole book, and may well have left a sweet savour in the prophet's memory. Stern, indeed, was the reality which the moment of his waking brought back to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-27.htm">Jeremiah 31:27</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-30.</span> - The physical side of the Messianic blessing. Its effect upon the heart of the pardoned sinners will be such that they will fully recognize the justice of the Divine judgments. There will no longer be any room for a certain favourite proverb; the death of a sinner will be universally acknowledged to be the reward of his personal sin (Keil). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sow</span>, etc. The passage may be illustrated by <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>, where the Church of the restored exiles is represented as complaining that the land (of Judah) has not been brought into a state of security, and that inhabitants (in sufficient numbers) have not been begotten. Similarly here, only the tone of complaint is wanting. The thought has suggested itself - Will the Israelites of the latter days be sufficient to fill up the land? Yes, is the answer of revelation; for Jehovah will perform a wonder, and make the people and their cattle so prolific that it will seem as if children and young cattle grew up like plants. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As I have watched... so will I watch,</span> etc. The allusion is to the twofold commission given to the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>), which was partly to pluck up and to destroy, partly to build and to plant. Jehovah has hitherto been "watchful" (another point of contact with ch. 1; see on Jeremiah 1:12) over the fulfilment of the destructive prophecies; he will now be equally zealous for that of the promises of regeneration. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a></div><div class="verse">In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have eaten a sour grape;</span> rather, <span class="accented">sour grapes.</span> The prophet (like Ezekiel,  ch. 18.) condemns the use of this proverb, and declares that the sinner is the artificer of his own ruin. At first sight, it may seem as if Jeremiah opposes the second commandment, which describes how God "visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). This, however, cannot really be, for he endorses this declaration later on (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The fact is that he is not so much condemning the proverb, as the blasphemous application of it made by the Jews of his time. It is an eternal truth that sin perpetuates itself (except by the miracles of grace) in the children of transgressors, and intensified sin leads to intensified punishment. But the children of transgressors do not cease to be responsible for their own share in the sin; - this was the truth which Jeremiah's contemporaries ignored. He does not deny the solidarity of the family or the race,but he superadds the neglected truth of the special responsibility of the individual. This is one among many evidences of the deepening sense of individual life in the later period of the Jewish monarchy. (A somewhat different view is offered by Delitzsch, 'Messianic Prophecies,' &sect; 50. According to him, Jeremiah looks forward to a time when the individual shall be liberated from the consequences of his solidarity with his race, and when personality shall be "invested with its rights." But can the individual be thus liberated?)

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-34.</span> - The new covenant. A prophecy which stands out from the rest of Jeremiah by its evangelical character, in which it strongly reminds us of parts of the second half of Isaiah. The doctrine of the covenant is "the thread which binds together the hopes and the fears of the prophet, his certainty of coming woe, his certainty of ultimate blessing." A covenant was granted of old, but that covenant had on man's side been broken. Still "the gifts and calling of God are not to be retracted" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>); and Jeremiah felt that the very nature of God guaranteed the renewal of the covenant on a new basis. "Covenant" is, no doubt, an unfortunate rendering. The Hebrew word so rendered means, primarily, a decision or appointment, and there is a whole group of passages in the Old Testament which requires this meaning (see the present writer's note, in 'The Prophecies of Isaiah,' on Isaiah 42:6). We retain it, however, as that with which the reader is familiar, and only remind him that God is everything, and man nothing, in fixing the terms of the transaction. The characteristics of the new covenant are three: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The relation between God and his people is protected from all risk by God himself making the people what he would have them be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Whereas, in the case of the old, the law of duty was written on <span class="accented">tables of stone</span>, in the case of the new the law is to be written on the <span class="accented">heart</span>; whereas, under the old, owing to the ritual character of the worship, the knowledge of God and his will was a complicated affair, in which men generally were helplessly dependent on a professional class, under the new, the worship of God would be reduced to the simplest spiritual elements, and it would be in every man's power to know God at first hand, the sole requisite for such knowledge as would then be required being a pure heart." And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "whereas, under the old, the provisions for the cancelling of sin were very unsatisfactory, and utterly unfit to perfect the worshipper as to conscience, by dealing thoroughly with the problem of guilt, under the new God would grant to his people a real, absolute, and perennial forgiveness, so that the abiding relation between him and them should be as if sin had never existed" (Dr. A.B. Bruce, in <span class="accented">The Expositor</span>, January, 1880, pp. 70, 71). Comp. the abolition of the ark indicated in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a>. - The inspired author of Hebrews tells us (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6-13</a>), speaking generally, that this promise delivered through Jeremiah was fulfilled in the gospel. But it must be remembered that the gospel has not yet taken form outwardly, except in a comparatively meagre sense. If the Jews as a nation (that is, the better part or kernel of Israel) should embrace the gospel, not necessarily in the logical expression familiar to the West, but in its essential facts and truths, we should see quite another embodiment of the promise, and feel the spiritual impulse in ourselves as we have not yet done. It seems appropriate, in conclusion, to quote a finely expressed passage from De Quincey's exposition of the New Testament term <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. Without pledging ourselves to the absolute correctness of his explanation of that word, his language may be well applied to Jeremiah's prophecy. "What would have been thought of any prophet, if he should have promised to transfigurate the celestial mechanics; if he had said, 'I will create a new pole star, a new zodiac, and new laws of gravitation;' briefly, 'I will make new earth and new heavens'? And yet a thousand times more awful it was to undertake the writing Of new laws upon the spiritual conscience of man."

Jeremiah, who had declared resistance hopeless, had been accused of treason, and imprisoned (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>), and in prison he remained till the close of the siege. Like St. Paul at Rome, however, he was allowed free communication with visitors, as appears from ver. 8 and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-1.htm">Jeremiah 38:1</a>.

There was no object to gain by extending the scope of the revelation beyond the immediate present, and Zedekiah's offences did not require such an anticipative punishment as the clear prediction of the details of his fate (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-6.htm">Jeremiah 39:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>).

There is, therefore, no reason why we should deviate (as most commentators do) from the ordinary Hebrew usage, and suppose "thine uncle" in this verse to refer to Shallum, and not rather to Hanameel. But how are we to explain this singular variation in phraseology? Either from the fact that the Hebrew for "uncle" is simply a word expressive of affection (it means "beloved," see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>), and might, therefore, just as well be applied to a cousin as to an uncle: or else. upon the supposition that the word for "son (of)" has fallen out of the text before "mine uncle," both in this verse and in ver. 12. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-8.htm">Jeremiah 32:8</a></div><div class="verse">So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> thine, and the redemption <i>is</i> thine; buy <i>it</i> for thyself. Then I knew that this <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The right of inheritance</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">of taking</span> <span class="accented">possession</span>) <span class="cmt_word">is thine.</span> The right, however, was dependent on the previous right of redeeming the land. Hence the speaker continues: <span class="cmt_word">The redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.</span> The Law directs, "If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-25.htm">Leviticus 25:25</a>). Jeremiah's kinsman, however, ascribes to him the right of pre-emption. This is not mentioned in Leviticus; hut, of course, no one would care to purchase a property till he was sure that the next kinsman would not insist on redeeming it. No one, it may be remarked, could purchase land unconditionally - the usufruct of it till the year of jubilee was all that was legally transferable; and even the original occupant had only a life interest in his land, the ownership of which was, strictly speaking, vested in the commune. This seems to Be the necessary inference from a comprehensive view of the passages relative to land in the Old Testament (see Mr. Fenton's 'Early Hebrew Life; ' and an article in the <span class="accented">Church Quarterly Review</span>, July, 1880). <span class="cmt_word">Then I knew,</span> etc. We may, perhaps, interpret this notice combined with that in ver. 6 thus: Jeremiah had had a presentiment, founded, perhaps, upon the distress to which his cousin had been reduced, that the latter would invite him to carry out the provisions of the Law; and his presentiments were generally so ordered by the Divine Spirit of prophecy as to be ratified by the event. Still, he had a measure of uncertainty till Hanameel actually came to him, and so demonstrated "that this had been the word of the Lord." In recording the circumstances, he not unnaturally reflects his later feeling of certitude in his description of the presentiment.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-9.htm">Jeremiah 32:9</a></div><div class="verse">And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <i>even</i> seventeen shekels of silver.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Seventeen shekels of silver; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about &pound;2 5<span class="accented">s</span>. 4<span class="accented">d</span>. (taking the shekel at 2<span class="accented">s</span>. 8<span class="accented">d.</span>). This has been thought a small price. Thirty shekels were paid for the potter's field (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a>); fifty by David, for Araunah's threshing floor and oxen (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a>). The Hebrew has "seven shekels and ten of silver;" hence the Targum increases the price by supplying "minas" before "of silver," bringing up the sum to one hundred and seven shekels. This, however, seems too much. Even if Jeremiah wished to be liberal, he would hardly have been able to go so far (probably) in excess of the market price. Who would have purchased the land on speculation, if Jeremiah had refused? The famine made life, the siege, a continuance of personal liberty, terribly uncertain. And, putting this out of the question, there may have been but a short time to elapse before the year of jubilee, when the land would revert to its original occupant (see above). The singular form of expression in the Hebrew, at which the Targum stumbled, may, perhaps, be the usual style of legal documents. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-10.htm">Jeremiah 32:10</a></div><div class="verse">And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <i>it</i>, and took witnesses, and weighed <i>him</i> the money in the balances.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - The Authorized Version is here so far wrong, on technical terms, that it seems best to retranslate the whole passage: "And I wrote (the circumstances) in the deed, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed the money in the balance. And I took the purchase deed, that which was sealed (containing the offer and the conditions), and that which was open; and I gave the purchase deed unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah (rather, Makhseiah), in the sight of Hanameel my uncle, and in the sight of the witnesses who subscribed the purchase deed, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard. And I charged Baruch before them, saying, Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel, Take these deeds, this sealed purchase deed, and this open deed; and put them into an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days." The deed was made in two copies, so that if the open one were lost, or suspected of having been tampered with, an appeal might always be made to the sealed copy. The latter was to be placed in an earthen vessel, to preserve it from injury by damp. It ought to be added that the words in ver. 11, rendered "containing the offer and the conditions," are difficult. "Containing" is not expressed in the Hebrew, and "offer" is not the ordinary meaning, though etymologically justifiable.

Jehovah's great purpose is the regeneration of his people. To "frame" or "form" is synonomous with "purpose" (see on. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-11.htm">Jeremiah 38:11</a>). The meaning of the verse is that Jehovah's very Name is a pledge of his fidelity to his promises (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). To "establish" is synonymous with "to carry out."

It must be admitted that this introduction hardly corresponds to the sequel, which does not contain any special secrets, as we should have thought. Either vers. 2, 3 have been inserted by a later (inspired) editor, whose mind was absorbed in high thoughts of the latter days - for this view may be urged the style and phraseology, which are hardly those of the surrounding chapters, hardly those of Jeremiah; or else we must adopt Hengstenberg's perhaps over subtle suggestion, which, however, does not touch the question of the phraseology, "that throughout Scripture dead knowledge is not regarded as knowledge; that the hope of restoration had, in the natural man, in the prophet, as well as in all believers, an enemy who strove to darken and extinguish it; that therefore it was ever new," or, in the words of Jeremiah, "great and secret things, which thou knowest not."

"They come" could only refer to the Jews, but these would rather be said to "go out;" the Hebrew writers are particular in distinguishing between to "come" and to "go out." Besides, there is no grammatical connection with the preceding verse. The Septuagint omits "they come," but the passage still remains enigmatical.

A variation in the form of expressing the Messianic hope is, however, not of much importance. Isaiah, for instance, sometimes refers to a single ideal king (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.); sometimes to a succession of noble, God-fearing kings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-1.htm">Isaiah 32:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That good thing which I have promised;</span> viz. in the parallel passage, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5, 6</a> (which see).

But though sin offerings would in this glorious time become things of the past, yet thank offerings are expressly excepted from abolition (ver. 11), and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a special latter-day promise is given to the priests. Moreover, Ezekiel, who repeats the prophecy of the new spiritual covenant (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-26.htm">Ezekiel 37:26</a>), gives an elaborate sketch of a new temple with a sacrificial system (ch. 40, etc.); and, if there is any inconsistency, we find the same one in the latter part of Isaiah. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-6.htm">Isaiah 61:6</a> the whole regenerate people of Israel is called "the priests of Jehovah;" but in <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-21.htm">Isaiah 66:21</a> the prophet distinctly states that there will be, in some sense, a priestly class within the chosen people.

At first sight the latter part of the promise seems a little unlike a blessing. But we have seen already (on <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-3.htm">Jeremiah 19:3</a>) that the members of the various branches of the royal family probably occupied the principal offices of the state, and the prophet imagines the future in forms borrowed from the present. A numerous sacerdotal class seemed equally necessary for the due magnificence of the ritual; and we must remember that preternatural fertility of the soil was a standing element of Messianic descriptions. The expressions used are, no doubt, hyperbolical, but the meaning seems clear enough. (Hengstenberg's notion, that the prophet rather indicates the abolition of the royal and sacerdotal distinctions (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), is surely very far fetched.)

Zedekiah will, it is true, be carried to Babylon, but he will not suffer a violent death; he will "die in peace," and be buried with all customary royal honours. A difficulty, however, has been felt in admitting this view. How could Zedekiah be said to die in peace, when he was "in prison till the day of his death" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>)? and how could the deposed king of a captive people be honoured with a public mourning? The reply is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, as compared with a cruel death by flaying or impalement, it was "peace" to live in the obscure quiet of a prison; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, as the Jews appear to have been left very much to themselves (see Ezekiel, <span class="accented">passim</span>), it is credible enough that they were allowed to show the customary honours to a deceased representative of David. At any rate, the alternative view seems not in accordance with sound exegesis, viz. that the verse means this, "If thou obey the word of the Lord, and surrender thyself to Nebuchadnezzar, thou shalt live and die in peaceable possession of the throne." What parallel can be produced for this violent interpretation?

From a notice in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> it appears that the Rechabites were a subdivision of the Kenites, the nomad tribe so closely connected with the Israelites (<a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18-22</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29</a>), especially with the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-29.htm">1 Samuel 30:29</a>). The names of Jonadab and of Jaazaniah and his progenitors (which include the sacred Name), together with the zeal of Jonadab for the worship of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15, 23</a>), seem to indicate that the religion of the Rechabites approximated closely to that of the Israelites. There seem, in fact, to have been two branches of the Kenites - one having Edomitish, the other Israelitish, affinities. Records of the former still exist in the Sinaitic inscriptions, and in the Arabian histories; indeed, there is still a tribe called Benu-l-Qain (often contracted into Belqein) in the Belqa (the ancient land of Ammon); and it would seem that there is an Arab tribe in Arabia Petraea, eastward of Kerak, which traces itself to Heber the Kenite. and goes by the name of Yehud Chebr, though it now denies any connection with Jews. There were also Jews of Khaibar, near Mecca, who played an important part in the early history of Islam (see further 'Zeitschr. der deutschen morgenland. Gesellschaft,' 8:706; 14:438; 28:568, 571). <span class="cmt_word">Into one of the chambers.</span> There were many "chambers" of different sizes attached to the temple, and employed partly for stores, partly for councils and assemblies, partly for guard chambers, and other official purposes (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a> we even find a private person occupying one of the "chambers." That into which Jeremiah conducted the Rechabites was, no doubt, one of the largest size; it was appropriated to the use of a single priestly family - the "sons of Hanan" (ver. 4).

This illustrates the uncompromising zeal of Jonadab in <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>; the religion of Baal was probably at the opposite pole in the matter of luxury to that of Jehovah as practised by Jonadab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not for you the life<br />Of sloth and ease within the city's gates,<br />Where idol feasts are held, and incense smokes<br />To Baalim and Ashtaroth; where man<br />Loses his manhood, and the scoffers sit<br />Perverting judgment, selfish, soft, impure."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Plumptre.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall drink no wine,</span> etc. The Rechabites were, in fact, typical Arabs. The Wahhabee movement, in our own century, may be taken as partly parallel, though, of course, a settled life is not one of the abominations of the neo-orthodox Islam. A still more complete parallel is given by Diodorus Siculus (19:94), who states it to be the law of the Nabataeans, "neither to sow corn, nor to plant any fruit-bearing herb, nor to drink wine, nor to prepare houses," and gives as the motive of this the preservation of their independence.

The form of the promise is remarkable; it runs, <span class="cmt_word">Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.</span> The phrase is, as Dr. Plumptre remarks, "all but essentially liturgical. It is used of the Levites (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5, 7</a>), of the worship of the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>), of the priests (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-11.htm">2 Chronicles 29:11</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-65.htm">Nehemiah 7:65</a>), of prophets (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-15.htm">1 Kings 18:15</a>), of priests and Levites together (<a href="../../par/psalms/134-1.htm">Psalm 134:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/135-2.htm">Psalm 135:2</a>)." It is, however, rash, perhaps, to maintain, with the same acute scholar, that the Rechabites were adopted into the tribe of Levi. The phrase may be simply chosen to indicate the singular favour with which Jehovah regarded the Rechabites - a favour only to be compared to that accorded to his most honoured servants among the Israelites - the patriarchs, the priests, and the prophets. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

This is,  at any rate, a better rendering than that quoted above, which is both weak in itself and obscures the connection. <span class="cmt_word">And will return;</span> rather, <span class="accented">so that they return.</span> "Returning," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> repentance, is necessary, because their "evil ways" have provoked Jehovah to "great anger and fury;" but is only possible by the Divine help (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31</a>, "To <span class="accented">give</span> repentance unto Israel"). Hence prayer is the first duty.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-9.htm">Jeremiah 36:9</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, <i>that</i> they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fifth year of Jehoiakim.</span> It is remarkable that the Septuagint has here the <span class="accented">eighth</span> year; and Josephus, too, relates that Jehoiakim paid tribute to Nebuchadnezzar in his eighth year. This latter statement seems to tally with the notices in <a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is there said to have lasted three years; this followed the rebellion; while the siege of Jerusalem was reserved for the short reign of Jehoiachin. Now, as this siege must have been the punishment of Jehoiakim's rebellion, and as the reign of the latter king lasted eleven years, we are brought to the same date as that given by Josephus for the commencement of the vassalage, viz. the eighth year. It is to this year, then, that <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> refers when it says, "In his days Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant;" and also the narrative before us in the statement that "they proclaimed a fast before Jehovah to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem." What other event would have produced such a concourse of worshippers? The battle of Carchemish (which took place in the fourth year of Jehoiakim)? But it was by no means clear as yet that the consequences of this would be disastrous for Judah. Carchemish was too far off for the people of Judah to show such serious alarm (similarly Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' etc., vol. 23. p. 300). If so, Jeremiah kept his prophecy by him for several years, till the fight moment came. <span class="cmt_word">The ninth month.</span> As this is a winter month (see ver. 22), Jeremiah evidently reckons by the Babylonian calendar, the ninth month of which, Kisiluv (Hebrew, Chisleu), began from the new moon of December.

Cushi himself was, doubtless, an Ethiopian, and probably (like Ebed-melech, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>) a eunuch, or at least chamberlain; his son and grandson were both worshippers of Jehovah (as their names indicate), but were not qualified to become Jewish citizens.

The fact mentioned in this verse is not recorded in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>; ch. 52; and its preciseness is a considerable pledge of its accuracy. The princes are four in number, and two of them have official titles attached. <span class="cmt_word">Nergal-sharezer</span> is the Hebraized form of Nirgal-sarra-ucur, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Nirgal (or Nergal), protect (or perhaps, has created) the king" - the name, as often, is a prayer. <span class="cmt_word">Samgar-nebo</span> is probably a modification of Sumgir-nabu, "Be gracious, Nebo;" but it has not yet been found in the inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">Sarsechim</span> has the appearance of being corrupt; the first part, however, may, perhaps, be the Babylonian for "king" ("prince" in Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-saris</span> has a meaning in Hebrew - "chief of the eunuchs;" but the analogies of "Rab-mag" and "Rab-shakeh" suggest that it is merely the Hebraized form of some Assyrian title. In any case, it would be better to render "the Rab-saris," and to attach it closely to the preceding name, Sarsechim being himself the official called Rab-saris (see, however, ver. 13). <span class="cmt_word">Rab-mag.</span> This was "one of the highest titles in the state" (G. Smith). The etymology of the latter half of the phrase is uncertain; for the connection of "mag" with "Magi" is a mistake which has been exposed by Dr. Schrader, in his work, 'Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament' (of which a translation is announced). The native form of the name may be <span class="accented">rubu emga</span> (Schrader) or <span class="accented">rubu makhe</span> (Friedr. Delitzsch), and the whole title will mean "high priest" or "chief of the sorcerers" (comp. Delitzsch, "The Hebrew Language viewed in the Light of Assyrian Research," Lond., 1883, p. 14). "The Rab-mag" would be more accurate, and the title ought to be attached to the preceding name, Nergal-sharezer. As a matter of fact, a Nirgal-sarra-ucur, who held the office of <span class="accented">rubu emga, is</span> mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions, and we may plausibly conjecture that he is the person here mentioned among the "princes." He was afterwards raised to the throne by the conspirators who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar (he is better known as Neriglissar). It is singular that two Nergal-sharezers should be here mentioned; possibly the first mention is due to a mistake. The names are hardly recognizable in the Septuagint. The "princes" took up their station <span class="cmt_word">in the middle gate.</span> The "breach" spoken of in ver. 2 enabled the Babylonians to occupy the whole of the lower city to the northeast of Zion. The "middle gate" probably separated these two parts of Jerusalem, and  those who were posted there commanded the temple and the citadel.

Various ingenious attempts have been made to explain this. Hitzig, for instance, followed by Dr. Payne Smith, thinks that "saying" may be an unusual equivalent for "that is to say," "for example," or the like; while the Vulgate and Rashi, followed by De Wette and Rosenm&uuml;ller, assume an ellipsis, and render, "It is commonly said," or "I might say." But far the most natural way is to suppose that "saying" is a fragment of the superscription of the prophecy, the remainder of which has been accidentally placed in ver. 6, and that we should read, "And the word of the Lord came unto me in the days of Josiah the king, saying." So J. D. Michaelis, Ewald, Graf, Naegelsbach. <span class="cmt_word">If a man put away his wife</span>. The argument is founded on the law of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>, which forbade an Israelite who had divorced his wife to take her again, if in the interval she had been married to another. The Jews had broken a still more sacred tie, not once only, but repeatedly; they worshipped "gods many and lords many;" so that they had no longer any claim on Jehovah in virtue of his "covenant" with his people. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he return</span>, etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Ought he to return?</span> The force of the term is potential (comp.

But as it is obviously inconsistent with the argument of the verse, and as the verb may equally well be the infinitive or the imperative, most recent commentators render, "And thinkest thou to return to me?" (literally, <span class="accented">and</span> returning to me! implying that the very idea is inconceivable).

The substance of the two verses (4 and 5) is well given by Ewald: "Unhappily her power truly to return has been exhausted, as not long ago after fresh signs of the Divine displeasure she prayed in beautiful language to [Jehovah] for new favor and abatement of the old sufferings, [but] she immediately fell again into her sin, and carried it out with cool determination."

Some sort of introduction, however, seems called for; Ewald supposes a shorter form, such as "And the Lord said further unto me." The view is not improbable, for although there is evidently a break between ver. 5 and ver. 6, there are points of contact enough between vers. 1-5 and the following discourse to prove that they represent the same prophetic period (comp. ver. 10 with ver. 3, vers. 8, 9 with ver. 1, ver. 12 with ver. 5, ver. 19 with ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Backsliding Israel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">apostasy Israel</span>. Usually a change or modification of a name is a sign of honor; here, however, it marks the disgrace of the bearer. Israel is apostasy personified (comp. vers. 14, 22).

Observe the distinction between the two sisters. Israel had openly broken the political and religious connection with Jehovah (<a href="../../par/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>); Judah nominally retained both, but her heart was towards the false gods (comp. the allegory in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, which is evidently founded upon our passage).

The preceding words seem to compel us either (with the Vulgate) to omit "and I saw" altogether, or (with Ewald) to read the first letter of the verb differently, and render "and she saw," taking up the statement of ver. 7 ("saw; yea, she saw," etc.). The latter view is favored by a phrase in ver. 10 (see note below). The same corruption of the text (which is palaeographically an easy one) occurs probably in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-13.htm">Ezekiel 23:13</a>. The error must, however, be a very ancient one, for the Septuagint already has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

So apparently the ancient versions. The only sense, however, which the word <span class="accented">kol</span> ever has in Hebrew is not "lightness," but "sound," "voice," and perhaps "rumor" (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>). Hence it is more strictly accurate to render "through the cry." etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-13.htm">Genesis 19:13</a>), or "through the fame," etc. (as Authorized Version, margin). But neither of these seems quite suitable to the context, and if, as King James's translators seem to have felt it necessary to do, we desert the faithful translation, and enter on the path of conjecture, why not emend <span class="accented">kol</span> into <span class="accented">klon</span> (there is no <span class="accented">vav</span>, and such fragments of true readings are not altogether uncommon in the Hebrew text), which at once yields a good meaning - "through the disgrace of her whoredom ?" Ewald thinks that <span class="accented">kol</span> may be taken in the sense of <span class="accented">k'lon</span>; but this is really more arbitrary than emending the text. <span class="cmt_word">With stones</span>, etc. (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>).

So Rashi, Naegelsbach, Payne Smith. Most commentators suppose the phrase to refer to Judah's obstinate wickedness (ver. 9), but this gives a weak sense. "Judah defiled the land, etc., and yet notwithstanding her repentance was insincere" - this is by no means a natural sequence of ideas. The right exposition increases the probability of the correction proposed at the beginning of ver. 8.

"To justify" can mean "to show one's self righteous," as well as "to make one's self righteous," just as "to sanctify" can mean, "to show one's self holy" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>), as well as "to make one's self holy."

There is a play upon words, or rather upon senses, in the original, "Turn, ye turned away ones" (comp. ver. 12). To whom is this addressed? To the Israelites in the narrower sense, for there is nothing to indicate a transition. Long as they have been removed from the paternal hearth, they are still "sons." <span class="cmt_word">For I am married unto you</span>. The same Hebrew phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>. Its signification has been a subject of dispute. From the supposed necessities of exegesis in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, some (e.g. Pococke and Gesenins) have translated, "for I have rejected you," but the connection requires not "for" but "though," which, however, is an inadmissible rendering; besides, the Hebrew verb in question nowhere has the sense of "reject" elsewhere (yet the Septuagint already has it, virtually at least, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-32.htm">Jeremiah 31:32</a>, q.v.). The literal meaning is <span class="accented">for I have been a lord over you</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a husband. Israel is despondent, and fears to return. Jehovah repeats his invitation, assuring Israel that he does not regard the marriage bond as broken. He is still (in spite of ver. 8) the husband, and Israel the bride (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">One of a city, and two of a family</span>. The promises of God are primarily to communities, but this does not prevent him from devoting the most special care to individuals. "One of a city, and two of a family," even though there should be but one faithful Lot in a city, and two such in a family (larger than a city, a single tribe containing only a few <span class="accented">mishpa-khoth</span>, or clans), yet I will admit these few to the promised blessings." Calvin's remark is worth noticing: "Hie locus dignus est observatu, quia ostendit Deus non esse, cur alii alios expectent; deinde etiam si corpus ipsum populi putreseat in suis peccatis, tamen si pauci ad ipsum redeant, se illis etiam fore placabilem." The historical facts to which the prophecy corresponds are variously regarded. Theodoret, Grotius, etc., suppose it to have been fulfilled exclusively in the return from Babylon; St. Jerome and others think rather of the Messianic period. Hengstenberg finds a continuous fulfillment, beginning at the time of Cyrus, when many belonging to the ten tribes joined themselves to the returning Judahites. He finds a further continuation in the times of the Maccabees, and in fact a continually growing fulfillment in preparation for that complete one brought in by Christ, when the premised blessings were poured out upon the whole <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>). "Zion and the holy land were at that time the seat of the kingdom of God, so that the return to the latter was inseparable from the return to the former." Dr. Guthe, however, the latest critical commentator on Jeremiah, thinks that the passage can be explained otherwise, viz." from each city one by one, and from each family two by two." This gives a more obvious explanation; but the ordinary rendering is more natural, and the explanation based upon it is in the highest degree worthy of the Divine subject. The doubt, of course, is whether in the Old Testament a special providence is extended elsewhere so distinctly to the individual. But Jeremiah is pre-eminently an individualizing prophet; he feels the depth and reality of individual as opposed to corporate life as no one else among the prophets. (At any rate, one point is clear, that the prophet foresees that the number of the exiles who return will be but small compared with the increase to be divinely vouchsafed to them; see ver. 16.)

In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-4.htm">Jeremiah 23:4</a>, the same word is rendered in the Authorized Version "shepherds," which would he less open to misunderstanding here than "pastors," civil and not spiritual authorities being intended (see on Jeremiah 2:8). The prophecy is, of course, not inconsistent with passages like <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, but as the national continuance of Israel was guaranteed, it was natural to refer to the subordinate civil authorities. <span class="cmt_word">According to mine heart</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to my mind</span>; for here, as also in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>, it is something very far from perfection which is ascribed to the chosen rulers.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-16.htm">Jeremiah 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit <i>it</i>; neither shall <i>that</i> be done any more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye be multiplied</span>; a common feature in pictures of the latter days (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-3.htm">Jeremiah 23:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-1.htm">Hosea 2:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Lord.</span> A definition of the Messianic period on its negative side - the ark shall he no longer the center of religious worship. We must remember that the ark is represented in the Law as the throne of Jehovah, who was "enthroned upon the cherubim" on the lid of the ark. It is in virtue of this sacramental presence that the temple is called the "dwelling-places" of Jehovah (e.g. <a href="../../par/psalms/46-4.htm">Psalm 46:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-1.htm">Psalm 84:1</a>, where Authorized Version has wrongly "tabernacles"). Now, in the Messianic period the consciousness of Jehovah's presence was to be so widely spread, at any rate in the center of God's kingdom, the holy city, that the ark would no longer be thought of; it would be, if not destroyed (we know, as a matter of fact, that the ark was destroyed in some unrecorded way), yet at least become utterly unimportant. Jerusalem would then naturally succeed to the title "Jehovah's throne" (applied to the temple in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-12.htm">Jeremiah 14:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall it come to mind</span>. The same phrase is used of the old heaven and earth as compared with the new (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>). In the concluding clauses, "visit" should rather be "miss," and "that be done" should be "it [viz. the ark] be made." On the whole subject of the prophetic descriptions of the worship of the Messianic period - descriptions which often wear at any rate a superficial appearance of inconsistency, see the luminous remarks of Professor Riehm, 'Messianic Prophecy,' pp. 161-163. At the same time, we must be extremely cautious how far we admit that Old Testament prophecies of the latter days have received a complete fulfillment in the Christian Church, considering how far the latter is from the realizable ideal, and also the importance attached in the New Testament as well as in the Old to the continuance of Israel as a nation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-17.htm">Jeremiah 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- Jerusalem's spiritual glory</span>. With Jeremiah's description, comp. that of Ezekiel," The name of the city from that day shall be, "The Lord is there" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-35.htm">Ezekiel 48:35</a>). This gives us the positive aspect of the Messianic period (comp. on ver. 16). Jerusalem shall be the spiritual center of the universe, because it is pervaded by the presence of the Most High (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-5.htm">Isaiah 4:5</a>). May we explain with Dr. Payne Smith, "Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Christian Church?" Only if the provisional character of the existing Church be kept well in view. <span class="cmt_word">All the nations</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all except the chosen people. The word for "nations" (<span class="accented">goyim</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> that often rendered "heathen." <span class="cmt_word">To the name</span>; or, <span class="accented">because of the name</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because Jehovah has revealed his name at Jerusalem. The phrase occurs again with a commentary in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>, "Thy servants are come because of the name of Jehovah thy God, for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt." But we must not suppose that "name" is equivalent to "revelation;" rather, there is here an ellipsis - "because of the name" is equivalent to "because of the revelation of the <span class="accented">name</span>," or better still, "... of the <span class="accented">Name</span>." The "Name of Jehovah" <span class="accented">is</span> in fact a distinct hypostasis in the Divine Being; no mere personification of the Divine attributes (as the commentators are fond of saying), but (in the theological sense) a Person. The term, "Name of such and such a God,:' is common to Hebrew with Phoenician religion. In the famous inscription of Eshmunazar, King of Zidon, Ashtoreth is called "Name of Baal;" and to whichever proper name the religious term Name may be attached, it means a personal existence in the Divine nature, specially related to the world of humanity; or, to use the language of Hengstenberg, the bridge between the latter and the transcendent heights of God as he is in himself. In short, the Name of Jehovah is virtually identical with the Logos of St. John, or the second Person in the blessed Trinity. Hence the personal language now and again used of this Name in the Old Testament, e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, "The Name of Jehovah <span class="accented">cometh</span> from far... <span class="accented">his lips</span> are full of indignation;" <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-8.htm">Isaiah 26:8</a>," The desire of our soul was to thy Name;" <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>, "So shall they fear the Name of Jehovah from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun." Comp. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; men do not run for safety to an abstract idea. Nor will all nations in the latter days resort either to a localized or to a spiritually diffused Jerusalem in the future, to gratify a refined intellectual curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall they walk</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the Israelites of the latter days; not the "nations" before mentioned (as Hengstenberg). The phrase occurs eight times in Jeremiah, and is always used of the Israelites. The word rendered "imagination" is peculiar (<span class="accented">sheri-ruth</span>). As Hengstenberg has pointed out, it occurs <span class="accented">independently</span> only in a single passage (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>); for in <a href="../../par/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, it is plainly derived, not from the living language, from which it had disappeared, but from the written. (The close phraseological affinity between the Books of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah has been already indicated.) The rendering of the Authorized Version, which is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, is certainly wrong; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">pravitatum</span>; the etymological meaning is "stubbornness." The error of the versions may perhaps have arisen out of a faulty inference from <a href="../../par/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13</a>, where it stands in parallelism to "their counsels." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-18.htm">Jeremiah 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - The reunion of the separated portions of the nation (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-11.htm">Hosea 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12, 13</a>). Observe, Israel is converted first, then Judah. This detail in the prophecy is not to be pressed. Not that the force of any prophecy is to be evaded, but that in this case the form of the statement is so clearly conditioned by the abounding sympathy of the prophet for the ten tribes. These had been so long languishing in captivity that they needed a special premise. The form of the promise is imaginative; this seems clearly to follow from the fact that in no other passage (except, indeed, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>) is there a reference to the spiritual primacy of Etihraim in the restored nation. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the land of the north</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

Of course, it would not be an accurate statement that the exiles from Judah were confined to "the land of the north."

This is most improbable; indeed, even <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a> does not really favor the doctrine of the universal fatherhood of God in the fullest sense of the word. Moreover, the pronoun rendered "thee" is in the feminine, indicating that the prophet has still in his mind the picture of Israel as Jehovah's bride. It would surely be an absurd statement that Jehovah would put his bride among the children! Render, therefore, <span class="accented">How will I found thee with sons!</span> comparing, for the use of the Hebrew verb, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>, and for that of the preposition, <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>. It is, in fact, the familiar figure by which a family or a nation is likened to a building ("house of Abraham," "of Israel"). Jehovah's purpose had been to make Abraham's seed as the dust of the earth (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-16.htm">Genesis 13:16</a>). Instead of that, the restored exiles would be few, and weak in proportion, so that the Jewish Church of the early restoration period is represented as complaining, "We made not the land salvation, neither were inhabitants of the world produced" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/26-18.htm">Isaiah 26:18</a>). A special Divine promise was needed to surmount this grave difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">A goodly... nations</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a heritage the most glorious among the nations</span>. So in Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6, 15</a>) Palestine is described as "the glory of all lands." The want of irrigation, and the denudation of the land, have no doubt much diminished the natural beauty and fertility of Palestine; but wherever moderate care is bestowed on the soil, how well it rewards it! <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt call me... shalt not turn</span>; rather, <span class="accented">thou wilt call me</span>... <span class="accented">wilt not turn</span>. It is the continuation of Jehovah's ideal for Israel. In response to his loving gifts, Israel would surely recognize him as her Father, and devote to him all her energies in willing obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Father</span> is here used, not in the spiritual and individualizing sense of the New Testament, but in such a sense as a member of a primitive Israelitish family, in which the <span class="accented">pairia potestas</span> was fully carried out, could realize. The first instance of the individualizing use of the term is in Ecclus. 23:1-4. (For the Old Testament use, comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-16.htm">Isaiah 63:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>.)

The prophet cannot bear to dwell upon the backsliding of his people. He knows the elements of good which still survive, and by faith sees them developed, through the teaching of God's good providence, into a fruitful repentance. How graphic is the description! <span class="cmt_word">On the very high places</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">bare</span>, <span class="accented">treeless heights or downs</span>, as ver. 2) where a licentious idolatry used to be practiced, <span class="cmt_word">a sound is heard</span> (render so, not <span class="accented">was</span> heard) - the sound of the loud and audible weeping of an impulsive Eastern people (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-29.htm">Jeremiah 7:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they have</span>; this evidently gives the reason of the bitter lamentation; render, <span class="accented">because they have</span>.

It seems strange at first sight that this verso does not stand before ver. 21. But the truth is that ver. 21 describes not so much the "conversion" of the Jews as their willingness to "convert" (an archaism of King James's Bible, which we may well regret), or "turn" to God. Christ must touch, or at least make his presence felt, in order that the sick man may be healed; a special call of God must be heard, in order that the sinner may truly repent. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, we come unto thee</span>. Efficacious, and not "irresistible" grace, is the doctrine of the Old Testament. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-23.htm">Jeremiah 3:23</a></div><div class="verse">Truly in vain <i>is salvation hoped for</i> from the hills, <i>and from</i> the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God <i>is</i> the salvation of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Truly in vain</span>, etc. An obscure and (if corruption exists anywhere) corrupt passage, which, however, it is hopeless to attempt to emend, as the corruption consists partly in wrong letters, partly in omitted letters or words (or both); and, moreover, the text employed by the Septuagint appears to have presented the same difficulty. The latter point is especially noteworthy. It is far from proving that the traditional text is correct; what it does suggest is that the writings of the prophets were at first written down in a very insecure manner. The rendering of the Authorized Version is substantially that of Hitzig, who explains "the multitude of [the] mountains," as meaning "the multitude of gods worshipped on the mountains" -too forced an expression for so simple a context. It seems most natural to suppose (with Ewald, Graf, and Keil), a contrast between the wild, noisy cultus of idolatrous religions, and the quiet spiritual worship inculcated by the prophets. Compare by way of illustration, the loud and ostentatious demonstrations of Baal's ritual in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>, with the sober, serious attitude of Elijah in the same chapter. The word rendered in the Authorized Version "multitude" has a still more obvious and original meaning, viz. "tumult;" and probably the Targum is not far from the true sense in rendering, "In vain have we worshipped upon the hills and not for profit have we raised a tumult on the mountains." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-24.htm">Jeremiah 3:24</a></div><div class="verse">For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For shame</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and the</span> Shame (i.e. the Baal).

So, too, Jerubbesheth stands for Jerubbaal (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>); Ishbosheth for Eshbaal (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath devoured the labor of our fathers</span>, etc.; a condensed way of saying that Baal-worship has brought the judgments' of God upon us,, our flocks, and herds, and all the other labor (or rather "wealth;' <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. fruit of labor) of our fathers, being destroyed as the punishment of our sins (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30-32</a>). Another view is that the "devouring" had to do with the sacrifices, but it is improbable that the sacrificial worship of Baal bad developed to such a portentous extent, and the former explanation is in itself more suitable to the context.

but no prophecy follows. It is not allowable to suppose, with Keil and others, that "the word" describes the entire body of prophetic utterance in ch. 40-45. (in spite of the fact that ch. 44. and 45. have special headings). The use would be unexampled; and a prologue of forty verses (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-7.htm">Jeremiah 42:7</a>) is equally contrary to prophetic analogy. Apparently the "word," or prophecy, which originally followed the heading has been lost or removed to some other place. <span class="cmt_word">Had let him go from Ramah.</span> Here is an apparent discrepancy with the account in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>. The brevity of the latter seems to account for it. No doubt the more precise statement in our passage is to be followed. After the capture of the city, a number of captives, including Jeremiah, were probably conducted to Ramah (see on  <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), where they had to wait for the royal decision as to their fate. Jeremiah, however, had already been in custody in the "court of the watch," and the writer of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a> simply omits the second stage of his captivity (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">In chains.</span> See ver. 4, "The chains which were upon thine hand."

It seems strange, however, that the occurrences related in ch. 40. and 41. should have taken so short a time. Gratz calls in question the accuracy of the chronological statement. He quotes <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-24.htm">Ezekiel 33:24-29</a>, which shows that at least six months (according to his calculation) after the fall of Jerusalem Jewish fugitives still lingered on, and hoped to obtain possession of their fatherland, and points out that time was necessary for Gedaliah to erect a temple at Mizpah (see on ver. 5), for cities to arise out of their ruins, and for cultivation of the soil to be resumed (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-10.htm">Jeremiah 40:10</a>). Besides, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-30.htm">Jeremiah 52:30</a>, a third deportation of Jews is mentioned. How can this be accounted for, if, only two months after the fall of Jerusalem, the remnant of the Jewish population emigrated under Johanan ben Kareah to Egypt? Gratz shows reason for thinking that this last deportation stands in close connection with Gedaliah's death, and that consequently the interval between this latter event and the fall of Jerusalem lasted, not two months, but five years. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Elishama.</span> Perhaps the Elishama men. tioned in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12</a> as a secretary of state; or perhaps a son of David of that name (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>; "son" being taken here in a wider sense). <span class="cmt_word">And the princes of the king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> (<span class="accented">one of</span>) <span class="accented">the princes of the king. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Even ten men;</span> rather, <span class="accented">and</span> ten men.

Keil thinks it was for the sake of the people, who needed time to collect themselves and listen calmly to the revelation. Ezekiel once waited seven days (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a>); but this was owing to his own disturbed state of mind. The answer of the Lord extends to ver. 18, the last four verses being an epilogue enforcing the Divine declaration. It consists of the promise (vers. 9-12) that, if the people will remain quietly in the land, they will be protected; and of the threat (vers. 13-18) that, if they presume to migrate into Egypt, they will perish there by sword, famine, and pestilence.

Herodotus (2:158) credits him with being the first to construct a canal to the Red Sea, which seems an exaggeration (see Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note <span class="accented">ap.</span> Rawlinson), also (4:42) with having caused the circumnavigation of Africa, after which the Phoenician seamen brought back the startling news that they had had the sun upon their right hand. This energetic monarch noticed the decline of Assyria, and, at the battle of Megiddo (Herodotus, 2:159, wrongly says Magdolus or Migdol), reattached Judah to the Egyptian empire. Four years later, at the battle of Carchemish, he himself sustained a crushing defeat at the hands of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Carehemish</span>. This was the great emporium of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. Its true site was discovered by Mr. George Smith, in his last fatal journey, to be at Jerabis or Jirbas, on the right bank of the Euphrates. It was anciently a city of the Kheta (equivalent to Khittim, "Hittites"), but passed to the Assyrians, under Sargon, under whom it attained the highest commercial prosperity, especially after the overthrow of Tyre by Sennacherib. The "mana," or <span class="accented">mina</span>, "of Gargamis" is constantly referred to as a standard weight in the commercial cuneiform inscriptions. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth year,</span> etc. Marcus Niebuhr wishes to put a stop before these words, so as to make them a definition of the date of the prophecy. He thinks the date of the battle of Carchemish was the third and not the fourth year of Jehoiakim. This view, however, is very uncertain (see Keil), and it is exegetieally very unnatural to detach the closing words of ver. 2 from those which precede. The obvious inference, moreover, from the prophecy (vers. 2-12) is that it was written at or about the time of the battle; a special date for the prophecy did not require to be given. Should Niebuhr's chronological combinations, however, turn out to be correct, the mistake would probably not be that of Jeremiah, nor of his scribe, but of his editor, who may easily have fallen into error in the mere minutiae of chronology.

Cavalry, properly so called, was not employed ... The Egyptians also enlisted auxiliaries, such as Mashawash, a tribe of Libyans, who, after the defeat of a confederation of northern peoples hostile to Menephtah, into which they had entered, refused to leave Egypt, and entered the Egyptian army; the Kahakas, another Libyan tribe; the Shardanas (Sardinians); the Madjaiu, who, after having been in war with the Egyptians under the twelfth dynasty, enrolled themselves under the standard of their conquerors, and constituted a sort of gendarmerie," etc. ('Dictionnaire d'Archdologie Egyptienne,' pp. 64, 65). Among the mercenaries mentioned by Jeremiah, the Ludim deserve special mention. They are generally supposed to be a North African people (and so <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). Professor Sayce, however, thinks they may be the Lydian soldiers by whose help Psammetichus made Egypt independent of Assyria, and his successors maintained their power (Cheyne's 'Prophecies of Isaiah,' 2:287). <span class="cmt_word">Come up, ye horses;</span> rather, <span class="accented">bound</span> (or, prance), <span class="accented">ye horses.</span> The verb is literally go up, and seems to be used in the same sense, only in the Hiphil or causative conjugation, in <a href="../../par/nahum/3-3.htm">Nahum 3:3</a> (which should begin, "Horsemen making (their horses) to rear"). Ewald and others render, "Mount the horses," the phrase being substantially the same as in ver. 4 (see above). But the parallelism here is opposed to this; and the prophet has evidently been a reader of the prophecy of Nahum, as the very next clause shows. <span class="cmt_word">Rage, ye chariots;</span> rather, <span class="accented">rush madly, ye chariots</span> (alluding to <a href="../../par/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Ethioplans;</span> Hebrew, Cush; often mentioned in connection with Egypt.

The "day of Jehovah" is an expression so familiar to us that we are in danger of losing a part of its sublime meaning. It is, in brief, "that crisis in the history of the world when Jehovah will interpose to rectify the evils of the present, bringing joy and glory to the humble believer, and misery and shame to the proud and disobedient .... This great crisis is called a day, in antithesis to the ages of the Divine long suffering: it is <span class="accented">Jehovah's</span> day, because, without a special Divine interposition, there would be no issue out of the perplexities and miseries of human life." We may say, with equal truth, that there are many "days of the Lord," and that there is only one. Every great revolution is a fresh stage in the great judgment day; "<span class="accented">die Weltgesehichte ist das Weltgericht"</span> (Schiller). The <span class="accented">loci classici</span> for the expression in the prophets are <a href="../../par/amos/5-18.htm">Amos 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6, 9</a> (in <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, the phraseology closely resembles that of our passage - "for there is a day unto Jehovah Sabaoth;" Jehovah, that is, hath it in readiness in the supersensible world, where there is no time, and where all God's purposes have an ideal, but no less real existence. We might, in fact, render our passage, "but that day (is the day that belongeth) unto the Lord," etc.). The Lord here, as generally elsewhere, is that expressive form which intimates the universal lordship of the God who has revealed himself to Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The sword.</span> A comparison with <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a> suggests that it is "the sword of the Lord" which is meant - a symbolic phrase for the Divine vengeance, which meets us again in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-12.htm">Jeremiah 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-20.htm">Judges 7:20</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>); <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>. If Jehovah can be spoken of as having an Arm, a Hand, and a Bow, why not also as having a sword? Both expressions represent the self-revealing side of the Divine nature, and are not merely poetical ornaments, but correspond to awful objective realities. Divine  vengeance exists, and must exercise itself on all who oppose the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Hath a sacrifice.</span> The same figurative expression occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-6.htm">Isaiah 34:6</a>, and, developed at considerable length, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17-20</a>, where the slaughtered foes are described as fatted beasts, rams, lambs, he-goats, bullocks - animals employed in the Jewish sacrifices. This, then, is the purpose for which this immense host "rolls up from Africa" - it is that it may fall by the Euphrates, at once as a proof of God's justice, and as a warning to transgressors.

The heading does not expressly state when the prophecy was written, but from the mention of Nebuchadnezzar, both in the heading and in the prophecy itself, we may assume a date subsequent to the battle of Carchemish, for the earlier prophecies contain no reference to that redoubtable name. An important question now arises - When did Nebuchadnezzar invade and conquer Egypt? and what would be the consequences of admitting that a Babylonian subjugation of that country is historically not proven? There can be no doubt that Jeremiah did hold out such a prospect; for he not only says so here, but also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8-13</a> and Jeremiah 44:30. In the latter prophecy it is not Necho, but Hophra, in whose reign the blow is to fall. But no monumental evidence has as yet been found [see, however, postscript to this note] of anything approaching to an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar; nor do the accounts of Herodotus (2:159, etc.) at all supply the deficiency (on this, however, see further at end of note). It is true that Josephus quotes passages from Berosus, the Babylonian historian, to the effect that Nabopolassar had set a Chaldean governor over Egypt, but that this governor had revolted, and that Nabopolassar's son, Nebuchadnezzar, crushed the rebellion and incorporated Egypt into his empire. But these events happened, according to the quotation from Berosus, partly before, partly immediately after, the death of Nabopolassar, and was consequently earlier than the prophecy in this chapter. Another fact of importance must be mentioned in this connection, viz. that Ezekiel repeats the announcement of the Babylonian conquest of Egypt, of which he speaks as if it were to happen at the close of the thirteen years of Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17-21</a>). Thus there is a gradual increase in the definiteness of the announcement. Looking at our chapter by itself, we might suppose that the conquest was to take place soon after the decisive battle at Carchemish. After the murder of Gedaliah, when Jeremiah had removed to Egypt, we find him foretelling the sore punishment of Egypt in greater detail, and the name of Hophra (instead of Necho) is introduced as that of the deposed king. Finally, Ezekiel (as we have seen) specifies a definite time. Now, it is true that our knowledge of this period is somewhat incomplete. We have not the direct historical proof that could be wished as to the result of Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre, though it would be fastidious to scruple at the evidence which satisfied so cool a judgment as that of George Grote. The great historian denies, however, that Tyre at this time suffered such a terrific desolation as is suggested by a literal interpretation of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26</a>, and continues in these remarkable terms: "Still less can it be believed that that king conquered Egypt and Libya, as Megasthenes, and even Berosus so far as Egypt is concerned, would have us believe - the argument of Latchet, 'Ad Herodot.,' 2:168, is anything but satisfactory. The defeat of the Egyptian king at Carchemish, and the stripping him of his foreign possessions in Judaea and Syria, have been exaggerated into a conquest of Egypt itself" ('Hist. of Greece,' vol. 3. p. 445, note 1). Supposing Mr. Grote's view of the facts of the siege of Tyre to be correct, it is clear that the prophet's reproduction of the Divine revelation made to him was defective; that it presents traces of a stronger human element than we are accustomed to admit. Tyre had to suffer a fall; but the fall was not as yet to be so complete a one as Ezekiel, reasoning upon his revelation, supposed. It is equally possible that Jeremiah and Ezekiel, reasoning upon the revelation of the inevitable fall of Egypt, mistook the time when, in its fulness, the Divine judg. ment was to take place. The case may, perhaps, turn out to be analogous to that of an apparently but not really unfulfilled prophecy in <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-3.htm">Isaiah 43:3</a>. A literal interpretation of that passage would give the conquest of Egypt to Cyrus; as a matter of  fact, we know that it was Cambyses, and not Cyrus, who fulfilled the prophecy. It would not be surprising if we should have to admit that it was Cambyses, and not any earlier monarch, who fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah. Certain great principles of God's moral government had to be affirmed; it was of no moment whatever whether Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, or Cambyses was the instrument of their affirmation. A parallel from Isaiah may again be adduced. The shameful captivity of Egypt, and perhaps Ethiopia, which Isaiah foresaw in the time of Sargon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>), was not realized in fact until Esar-haddon despoiled Tithakah, King of Egypt and Ethiopia, of the whole of Upper Egypt. There are cases in which a literal fulfilment of prophecy may be abandoned without detriment to Divine revelation, and this seems to be one of them. And yet we must always remember that even the letter of the prophecy may some day turn out to be more nearly in harmony with facts than we have supposed, our knowledge of this period being in several respects so very imperfect. It has been acutely pointed out that the oracle given to Necho (Herod., 2:158), "that he was labouring for the barbarian," seems to imply a current expectation of an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar, and that the gradual conquest by that king of one neighbouring country after another suggests that the invasion of Egypt was at any rate the object at which he aimed. The silence of Herodotus as to a Chaldean invasion is, perhaps, not very important. He does not mention Necho's defeat by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish, nor does he ever refer to the victories over Egypt of any King of Assyria. POSTSCRIPT. - The above note is left precisely as it was written, February, 1881, in ignorance of Wiedemann's then recent discovery of a contemporary hieroglyphic inscription which, as the report of the German Oriental Society expresses it, "ratifies the <span class="accented">hitherto universally doubted</span> fact of an invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar." The hieroglyphic narrative is supplemented and confirmed by two cuneiform records, and the combined results are as follows. In the thirty-seventh year of his reign, Hophra or Apries being King of Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar undertook an expedition against Egypt, and penetrated as far as the island of Elephantine, and damaged the temple of Chnum, which stood there. His army could not, however, pass the cataracts. At Syene the Egyptian troops, under Neshor, met and repelled the invaders. Two years later, however, the Babylonians came again, were victorious over the Egyptian host under Amasis, and compelled the whole land to pay tribute. Thus we have a remarkable confirmation of Ezekiel's prophecy that Egypt should be "waste and desolate from Migdol unto Syene, even unto the border of Ethiopia" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-10.htm">Ezekiel 29:10</a>). It should be mentioned that the Babylonians are not described in the hieroglyphics by their proper name, but as "the Syrians (?), the peoples of the north, the Asiatics;" it is from a terra-cotta cuneiform tablet that we learn that, in Nebuchadnezzar's thirty-seventh year (B.C. 568-7), a war arose between him and the King of Egypt, which ended with the payment of tribute to the former (Wiedemann, in 'AEgyptische Zeitschrift,' 1878, pp. 2-6 and 87-89; ' Geschichte AEgyptens,' 1880, pp. 168-170). The value of prophecy does not, happily, depend on the minuteness of its correspondence with history, and the evidential value of the argument from such a correspondence is but secondary. Still, as long as such a correspondence can be proved, even in part, by facts such as Wiedemann has discovered, the apologist is perfectly justified in using it in confirmation of the authority of Scripture. The second prophecy falls into two parts - vers. 14-19 and 20-26 respectively.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-15.htm">Jeremiah 46:15</a></div><div class="verse">Why are thy valiant <i>men</i> swept away? they stood not, because the LORD did drive them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why are thy valiant men,</span> etc.? The literal rendering of the received text is, <span class="accented">Why is thy strong ones</span> (plural) <span class="accented">swept sway</span> (or, <span class="accented">ca</span>s<span class="accented">t down</span>)<span class="accented">? He stood not, because Jehovah thrust him!</span> It is true that the first half of the verse might, consistently with grammar, be rendered, "Why are thy strong ones swept away?" But the following singulars prove that the subject of the verb in the first verse half must itself be a singular. We must, therefore, follow the reading of the Septuagint, Vulgate, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, and many of the extant Hebrew manuscripts, and change the plural "strong ones" into the singular  "strong one." The word so rendered is elsewhere in Jeremiah one used (in the plural) of strong horses (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>); but there is no necessity to bind ourselves to this acceptation. Other possible meanings are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> strong man, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> steer, bull, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13</a> and Psalm 50:13, and (metaphorically of princes) Psalm 68:31. It is a tenable view that "thy strong one" is to be understood distributively as equivalent to "every strong one of thine." But it is certainly more plausible to regard the phrase as a synonym for Apis, the sacred bull in which the supreme god Osiris was believed by the Egyptians to be incarnate. This was a superstition (strange, no doubt, but not so ignoble as some have thought) as deeply ingrained in the Egyptian mind as any in their complicated religion. "In fact, they believed that the supreme God was with them when they possessed a bull bearing certain hieratic marks, the signs of the incarnation of the divinity" (Pierrot). His death was the signal for a mourning as general as for a Pharaoh, and the funeral ceremonies (accounts of which are given in the inscriptions) were equally splendid. M. Mariette has discovered, in the neighbourhood of Memphis, a necropolis in which the Apis bulls were successively interred from the eighteenth dynasty to the close of the period of the Ptolemies. For the Apis to be "swept away" like ordinary plunder, or "cast down" in the slaughtering trough (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-7.htm">Isaiah 34:7</a>), was indeed a token that the glory of Egypt had departed. It is a singular coincidence that the very word here employed by Jeremiah for "bull" (abbir) was adopted (like many other words) into the Egyptian language - it received the slightly modified form <span class="accented">aber</span>. The Septuagint, it should be added, is in favour of the general view of the verse thus obtained, and the authority of the <span class="accented">Egyptian-Jewish</span> version in a prophecy relative to Egypt is not slight. Its rendering of the first half is, "Why hath Apis, thy chosen calf, fled?" But the probability is that it read the Hebrew differently, "Why hath Khaph (  =   Apis), thy chosen one, fled?" This merely involves grouping some letters otherwise, and reading one word a little differently. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-16.htm">Jeremiah 46:16</a></div><div class="verse">He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To fall;</span> rather, <span class="accented">to stumble</span>. The fugitives are in such a wild confusion that they stumble over each other. The parallel passage in the earlier prophecy (ver. 12) suggests that the Egyptian warriors are here referred to, the most trustworthy portion of which, since the time of Psammetichus, was composed of mercenaries, the native troops having lost that military ardour for which they had been anciently renowned (see Herod., 2:152, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson's note <span class="accented">ap.</span> Rawlinson). Being devoid of patriotic feeling, it was natural that these hired soldiers should hasten from the doomed country, exclaiming, as the prophet puts it, <span class="cmt_word">Arise, and let us go again to our own people.</span> Greeks were probably among the speakers, at any rate, Ionians and Carians formed the mercenary troops of Psammetiehus, according to Herodotus (2:152). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-17.htm">Jeremiah 46:17</a></div><div class="verse">They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt <i>is but</i> a noise; he hath passed the time appointed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They did cry there,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">they cry there</span>, viz. the following words. But why should attention be called to the place where the cry is made? and why should the mercenaries (the subject of the preceding verb, and therefore presumably of this verb) have their exclamation recorded? Alter the vowel points (which merely represent an early but not infallible exegetical tradition), and all becomes clear. We then get a renewal of the summons in ver. 14 to make a proclamation respecting the war. The persons addressed are, not foreigners, but the children of the soil, and the summons runs thus: "Call ye the name of Pharaoh, King of Egypt, Desolation." No longer "Pharaoh," honoured by titles indicating that he, like Apis, is a Divine incarnation (<span class="accented">neb</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> lord, and <span class="accented">nuter, i.e.</span> god), but <span class="accented">Shaon</span>, the Hebrew for Desolation, is the fittest name for the fallen monarch. The custom of changing names with a symbolic meaning is no strange one to readers of the prophecies. We have met with it in this very book (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-3.htm">Jeremiah 20:3</a>); and Isaiah contains a parallel as exact as could be desired, in the famous passage in which the prophetic name (itself symbolic) of Egypt (<span class="cmt_word">Rahab</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> boisterousness, arrogance) is changed into "Rahabhem-shebheth" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Rahab! they are utter indolence"). In behalf of this view we may claim the authority of a tradition still older than that preserved in the vowel points, for the Septuagint (followed substantially by the Peshito and the Vulgate) has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">He hath passed the time appointed.</span> A difficult clause, and variously interpreted. One thing is clear, that "passed" cannot be correct, as the verb is in the Hifil or causative conjugation. We must, at any rate, render, "He hath let the time appointed pass by." This is, in fact, the simplest and most natural explanation. There was a time within which repentance might have averted the judgment of God; but this "accepted time" has been foolishly let slip.

The King of Babylon is compared to "Tabor among the mountains and Carmel by the sea." Mount Tabor is a most prominent object, owing to the wide extent of the plain of Esdraelon, in which it is situated; and a similar remark applies to Mount Carmel. The view of Tabor differs considerably according to the point from which it is taken; but "its true figure is an elongated oval" (Thomson). Carmel, so called from the rich orchards and vineyards with which it was anciently adorned, is not lofty (being only about six hundred feet above the sea), but the form in which it breaks off towards the sea has a beauty of its own. It is now deprived of its rich forest and garden culture, but is still described as "a glorious mountain."

The "daughter of Egypt" means the population of Egypt, the land being regarded as the mother of its people. <span class="cmt_word">Furnish thyself to go into captivity.</span> The rendering of the margin is, however, more exact. The "vessels of captivity [or, 'exile']" are a pilgrim's staff and wallet, with the provisions and utensils necessary for a journey (so in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-4.htm">Ezekiel 12:4</a>).

The well nourished heifer reminds of the prosperity of the fruitful Nile valley. But destruction cometh; it cometh out of the north; rather, <span class="accented">a gadfly from the north hath come upon her</span> (not, "hath come, hath come," as the received text has - a very slight change in one letter is required, supported by the versions). The figure is precisely analogous to that of the "bee in the land of Assyria" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). St. Chrysostom renders "a gadfly" (see Field, 'Origen's Hexapla,' 2:708); and so virtually Aquila and Symmachus.

On the other hand, the description will exactly apply to the Caftans and Ionians in the service of Psammetichus and Apries (Herod., 2:152, 163), who were "for many years" settled "a little below the city of Bubastis, on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile."

Egypt, or, more strictly, Egypt's grandeur - its rich and complex national life, its splendid cities, its powerful army, all combined in one, is now compared to a forest (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-14.htm">Jeremiah 21:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-6.htm">Jeremiah 22:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-13.htm">Isaiah 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-18.htm">Isaiah 10:18, 19, 33, 34</a>). It seems far fetched to suppose, with Graf and Dr. Payne Smith, that the comparison of the Chaldean warriors to wood cutters arose from their being armed with axes. It is probably true that the Israelites did not use the battle axe, but the axe is merely an accident of the description. It is the forest which suggests the mention of the axe, not the axe that of the forest, and forests were familiar enough to the Israelites.

De Dieu's explanation is, "Because the forest is so dense, so intricate, it is necessary to clear a path by cutting down the trees." But this does not seem to suit the context. Surely no other reason was required for the destruction of the "forest" than the will of the wood cutters.

"In the days of old," patriarchal and unmilitary, the fertile valley of the Nile offered a peaceful and a happy home to its teeming inhabitants; those times shall yet come again. To understand this, we must assume that during its period of depression Egypt has been but sparsely peopled, owing to the large numbers of its inhabitants carried away captive. Another explanation, "afterwards Egypt shall stay at home [i.e, 'be quiet']," though equally justifiable item the point of view of the lexicon (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-7.htm">Psalm 55:7</a>), seems less natural. Possibly <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13-16</a> is a development of our passage; it contains a promise of future remission of punishment, though a promise qualified in such a way as to be akin to a threat. The words, "And it shall no more be the confidence of the house of Israel" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a>), seem like a comment on Jeremiah's threat to "Pharaoh, and them that trust in him," in the preceding verse.

If Necho conquered Gaza at the period supposed, it would be on his way to Carchemish, and not on his return. Besides," the north" is the standing symbol for the home of the dreaded Assyrian and Babylonian foes (see on Jeremiah 1:14). Isaiah had uttered a very similar prediction when the Assyrian hosts were sweeping through Palestine (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An overflowing flood;</span> rather, torrent. The same phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>, where the "breath" of the angry God is described with this figurative expression.

It is used (but as the equivalent of a different Hebrew word) in the Authorized Version of <a href="../../par/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>:12, 13 of the confused sound made by an army in motion. In the present passage, the Hebrew word means something more definite than that in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>; it is the "crashing" of an earthquake, or (as here) the "rattling" of chariots. <span class="cmt_word">The rumbling of his wheels.</span> "Rumbling" is a happy equivalent. The Hebrew (<span class="accented">hamon</span>) is the word referred to in the preceding note as meaning an indefinite confused sound. <span class="cmt_word">The fathers shall not look back to their children,</span> etc. An awful picture, and still more effective in the concise language of the original. The Hebrew Scriptures excel (as still more strikingly, but with too great a want of moderation, does the Koran) in the sublime of terror. So overpowering shall the panic be that fathers will not even turn an eye to their helpless children. Observe, it is said "the fathers," not "the mothers." The picture is poetically finer than that in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-56.htm">Deuteronomy 28:56, 57</a>, because the shade of colouring is a degree softer. <span class="cmt_word">Feebleness of hands.</span> A common expression for the enervation produced by extreme terror (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-24.htm">Jeremiah 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>).

It is "the day of the Lord" that is meant, that revolutionary "shaking of all things" (to use Haggai's expression, <a href="../../par/haggai/2-21.htm">Haggai 2:21</a>), as to which see further in note on Jeremiah 46:10. <span class="cmt_word">To cut off...  every helper that remaineth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every ally on whom they could still reckon. This passage favours the view that the judgment upon the Philistines took place at the same time as that upon Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar's object was to isolate Tyre and Sidon as completely as possible. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant.</span> The Philistines had suffered so much from repeated invasions as to be only a "remnant" of the once powerful nation which oppressed Israel (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">The country of Caphtor.</span> Some would render "the coastland of Caphtor," but the idea of "coast" seems to be a secondary one, derived in certain passages from the context. Properly speaking, it is a poetic synonym for "land,"  and is generally applied to distant and (accidentally) maritime countries. "Caphtor" was understood by the old versions to be Cappadocia. But as the remains of the Cappadocian language point to a Persian origin of the population which spoke it, and as the Caphtorim originally came from Egypt, it is more plausible to suppose, with Ebers, that Caphtor was a coast district of North Egypt. Crete has also been thought of (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-5.htm">Jeremiah 47:5</a></div><div class="verse">Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off <i>with</i> the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - The prophet changes his style. In ecstasy or imagination, he sees the calamity which he has foretold already come to pass. Philistia is not, indeed, altogether annihilated; it was not the will of God to make a full end as yet with any of the nations round about. But it is reduced to extremities, and fears the worst. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Baldness</span>. A sign of the deepest sorrow (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). <span class="cmt_word">Ashkelon is cut off.</span> Ruins of Ashkelon are still visible. "It is evident that the walls of the old city were built on a semicircular range of rocky hills, which ended in perpendicular cliffs of various heights on the seashore. Wherever nature failed, the weak places were strengthened by the help of earthworks or masonry. On the southern and southeastern sides, the sand has penetrated the city by means of breaches in the walls, and every day it covers the old fortifications more and more, both within and without. The ancient towns alone rise distinctly, like rocky islands, out of the sea of sand. The ruins on the north are bordered by plantations of trees. They lie in such wild confusion that one might suppose that they were thrown down by an earthquake. There is no secure landing place; the strip of sand at the foot of the western wall is covered at high tide, when the waves beat against the cliffs. Still J.G. Kinnear, in 1841, found some remains of a mole, and this discovery is confirmed by Schick [the able German architect now at Jerusalem]." Thus writes Dr. Guthe, in the Journal of the German Palestine Exploration Society (1880), remarking further that, in a few generations, the ruins of Ashkelon will be buried under the drifting sand. It is partly the sand hills, partly the singular fragmentariness of the ruins of Ashkelon, which gives such an air of desolation to the scene, though, where the deluge of sand has not invaded, the gardens and orchards are luxuriant. Dr. W.M. Thomson, in the enlarged edition of  'The Land and the Book' (London, 1881, p. 173), observes that "the walls and towers must have been blown to pieces by powder, for not even earthquakes could throw these gigantic masses of masonry into such extraordinary attitudes. No site in this country has so deeply impressed my mind with sadness." <span class="cmt_word">With the remnant of their valley.</span> "With" should rather be "even." "Their valley" means primarily the valley of Ashkelon; but this was not different from the valley or low-lying plain (more commonly called the <span class="accented">Shefelah</span>) of the other Philistian towns; and the whole phrase is an enigmatical, poetic way of saying "the still surviving population of Philistia." But this addition certainly weakens the passage, and leaves the second half of the verse abnormally short. It is far better to violate the Massoretic tradition, and attach "the remnant," etc., to the second verse half. But "their valley" is still a rather feeble expression; a proper name is what we look for to make this clause correspond to those which have gone before. The Septuagint reads differently, for it renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;</span>. We know from <a href="../../par/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a> that some of the Anakim were left "in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod;" and in David's time the Philistines could still point to giants in their midst (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16-22</a>), who, like the Anakim (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20</a>), are called in the Hebrew, Rephaim. It may be objected, indeed (as it is by Keil), that the Anakim would not be traceable so late as Jeremiah's time; but Jeremiah was presumably a learned man, and was as likely to call the Philistines Anakim, as an English poet to call his countrymen Britons. No one who has given special attention to the phenomena of the Hebrew text elsewhere can doubt that "their valley" is a corruption; the choice lies between the "Anakim" of the Septuagint and the plausible correction of a Jewish scholar (A. Krochmal), "Ekron." <span class="cmt_word">How long wilt thou cut thyself?</span> Shall thy lamentation never cease? (comp. on Jeremiah 16:6). The question is in appearance addressed to "the remnant" (personified as a woman), but in reality the judicial Providence who sends the calamity.

It is not quite clear what "her little ones" in the first mentioned correction mean. Some think, the children; others, the poor; Hitzig prefers the small towns of Moab.

To the present commentator (as also to Delitzsch - see his note on Isaiah 15:5) there seems no reasonable doubt that <span class="accented">b'ki</span>, the word rendered "weeping," should rather be <span class="accented">bo</span>, "upon it," so that the passage will run, as in Isaiah, "for the going up of Luhith with weeping doth one go up if," Hitzig (whom for once we find agreeing with Delitzsch) remarks that the miswriting <span class="accented">b'ki</span> for <span class="accented">bo</span> may be easily accounted for by the fact that <span class="accented">ki</span>, "for," is the word which follows next. We have no right to ascribe to Jeremiah such an artificial and un-Hebraic an expression as that of the received text. Small as the matter may be in itself, it is not unimportant as suggesting to the <span class="accented">Old</span> Testament student a caution against the too unreserved adoption of the canon <span class="accented">Lectioni faciliori praestat ardua</span>. <span class="cmt_word">In the going down of Horonaim.</span> An interesting variation from Isaiah. The older poet, less attentive to minutiae, had said vaguely, "in the road to Horonaim;" by a slight change of expression, the younger and more reflective writer produces a striking antithesis between the ascent to the hill-town, and the descent to the hollow in which Horonaim ("double cavern") appears to have been situated. It is possible, however, that Jeremiah has preserved the original reading, and that "the road" in Isaiah, <span class="accented">l.c.</span>, is due to the carelessness of a scribe. <span class="cmt_word">The enemies have heard a cry of destruction.</span> But why this reference to the enemies? The rendering, however, is ungrammatical. The text is, literally, <span class="accented">the enemies of the cry of destruction have they heard.</span> The prophecy in Isaiah omits "the enemies of," and has a different verb for "have they heard." Can the inserted words be an intrusion from the margin? The later scribes were accustomed to insert glosses in the margin on occasions where we should have thought them entirely unnecessary for the purpose of explanation. But then why "the enemies of"? It is an insoluble enigma.

The sense remains the same. It is tempting to see an allusion to one of the towns called Aroer (as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>). But the only Aroer the prophet could be thinking of is that on the Amen (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a>), which could not be described as "in the wilderness."

This helps us to understand the idolatry into which the Jews fell during the Exile (<a href="../../par/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>); they imagined that Jehovah himself was "in captivity," and restrained from putting forth his power on behalf of his worshippers. The text reading is not Chemosh, but Chemish; the latter form does not occur elsewhere, but has been thought to illustrate the name of the Hittite city Carchemish (the Hittites or their predecessors may have been worshippers of this deity), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "castle of Chemosh."

But even if the verb in third masc. sing. be allowable after the plural noun, it is very harsh to give it such an interpretation, when the context says nothing about fire or smoke. J.D. Michaelis and Ewald, therefore, propose to change the vowel points of the first word, rendering, "The spoiler of Moab and of her cities is gone up;" and Dr. Payne Smith inclines to follow them.

But the rendering of our version is neither in itself tenable nor is it that intended by the accentuation. The rendering suggested by the latter is "his praters" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> soothsayers), as the word, no doubt, must be taken in Jeremiah 1:36; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-25.htm">Isaiah 44:25</a>.

"Sibmah," according to St. Jerome, was not more than half a mile from Heshbon.

By a touch of poetic hyperbole the prophet traces the excellence of vines such as those of En-gedi (on the western bank of the Dead Sea) to a Moabitish origin. The reference to <span class="cmt_word">the sea of Jazer</span> throws the whole passage into confusion.

In <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9, 10</a> an allusion is made to this double meaning, and so, perhaps, it may be here ("There shall be shouting, but not that of the peaceful vintagers at their work").

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a></div><div class="verse">From the cry of Heshbon <i>even</i> unto Elealeh, <i>and even</i> unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar <i>even</i> unto Horonaim, <i>as</i> an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - Based on <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4-6</a>. The cry of one town echoes to another, and is taken up afresh by its terrified inhabitants. Heshbon and Elealeh lay on eminences but a short distance apart, so that the shrill cry of lamentation would be heard far away in the southeast at Jahaz. Zoar and Horonaim both lay in the southern half of Moah (see on vers. 3, 4). <span class="cmt_word">An heifer of three years old.</span> If this is the right rendering, the phrase is descriptive of Horonaim, which may, in the time of Jeremiah, have been a "virgin fortress." But the phrase, thus understood, comes in very oddly, and in the parallel passage in Isaiah it stands, not after Horonaim, but after Zoar; it hardly seems likely that there were two Gibraltars in Moab. Another rendering (Ewald, Keil) is, "(to) the third Eglath." This involves an allusion to the fact that there were other places in Moab called Egiath or Eglah, which has been rendered highly probable by Gesenius. <span class="cmt_word">The waters also of Nimrhn.</span> Canon Tristram speaks of the "plenteous brooks gushing from the lofty hills into the Ghor-en-Numeira." Consul Wetzstein, however, says that nature appears there under so unspeakably gloomy an aspect, that the identification is impossible. He proposes a site in the Wady So'eb, about fourteen miles east of the Jordan, which with its luxuriant meadows, covered with the flocks of the Bedouin, is probably suitable to the passages in Isaiah and Jeremiah (Excursus it. in Delitzsch's 'Jesaja,' 4th edit., pp. 572, 573). So also Seetzen, who remarks that the lower part of this wady is still called Nahr Nimrin. In <a href="../../par/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> a place called Beth - nimrah is mentioned as situated in the valley (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Jordan valley); no doubt this was in the wady referred to by the prophets. "The valley" seems to have been sometimes used in a wider signification, so as to include lateral valleys like that of Nimrim. The antiquity of the name is shown by its occurrence in the Annals of Thothmos III., who penetrated into the heart of Palestine, and, in the temple of Karnak, enumerates the cities which he conquered. From before  <span class="date">B.C. 1600</span> to nearly A.D.  this secluded valley has borne precisely the same name!

The meaning of the words in Isaiah is that, the desolation being so great, the Moabites shall carry away as much of their goods as they can. In this new context, however, we can only explain this unexpected "therefore" by referring to a habit of the Israelitish mind by which that which contributed to a result was regarded as worked purposely for that result.

It was so on a former occasion (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-14.htm">Jeremiah 2:14</a>), and it is so again, now that the Ammonites are occupying the land of the Gadites. True, the present generation has lost its property, but the next is the heir to all its rights and privileges. <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> rather, <span class="accented">their King</span> - their Melech or Moloch; it is the heavenly, not the earthly king who is referred to (so in <a href="../../par/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>). The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Vulgate, however, read <span class="accented">Milcom</span>, which was the name of the Ammonite deity; this is only a different vocalizing of the consonants of the text. The actual vowel points give "malcam." This reading may, of course, be interpreted of the <span class="accented">earthly</span> king of the Ammonites. But this view ignores the obvious parallelism of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, "Chemosh shall go forth into captivity." <span class="cmt_word">Inherit</span>. The primary meaning of the word is "to take possession of, especially by force, <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-6.htm">1 Kings 21:6</a>" (Gesenius, <span class="accented">ad voc</span>.), and this is the sense evidently required here (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-10.htm">Jeremiah 8:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a></div><div class="verse">Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, <i>and</i> his priests and his princes together.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Heshbon</span>.

In <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-4.htm">Isaiah 15:4</a> and Isaiah 16:9 it is reckoned to the Moabites. There was a continual warfare between the neigh-bouring tribes of Reuben and Gad on the one hand, and the Moabites and Ammonites on the other. Let Heshbon lament, because <span class="cmt_word">Ai is spoiled</span>. The introduction of At, which is only known to us as a Canaanitish town, near Bethel, on the wrong side of the Jordan for Moab, is startling. It is replied that we have no list of the Ammonitish cities, and that there may have been another town named At. The reply is valid; but loaves a second difficulty untouched, viz. that the mention of a third place destroys the continuity of thought. First, we are made acquainted with the fall of Rabbah; then Heshbon (probably the second place in the country) is called upon to wail because <span class="accented">x</span> has been taken by storm; then the populations of the "daughter" cities are summoned to join in the lamentation over Rabbah; - is it not reasonable to conclude that the subject of the mourning is one and the same? Now, it is well known that the received text abounds in small errors arising from the confusion of similar Hebrew letters, and that among the letters most easily confounded are <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">resh.</span> Is it not an obvious conclusion that for Ai we should rather read Ar ("the city"), a name as suitable for the capital of Ammon as for that of Moab? It is true that we have no example elsewhere of Rabbah being called by the name of Ar; but in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3, 14</a> it is described as "the city," and we have to be on our guard against the argument <span class="accented">a silentio</span> - that favourite weapon of destructive  criticism! Since a conjecture must be made, it is more respectful to the prophet to choose the one which is most suitable to the context. <span class="cmt_word">Daughters of Rabbah;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> unwalled towns (as in ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">Run to and fro by the hedges;</span> rather, <span class="accented">by the enclosures</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wander about in the open country, seeking a lodging place in the enclosures of the sheepfolds (so <a href="../../par/numbers/32-24.htm">Numbers 32:24</a>, Hebrew) or the vineyards (so <a href="../../par/numbers/22-24.htm">Numbers 22:24</a>, Hebrew). <span class="cmt_word">Their king</span>; or, <span class="accented">Milcom</span> (see on ver. 1).

Observe, no allusion is made by Jeremiah to any special bitter feeling of the Edomites towards the Israelites, such as is implied in <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a>, and other passages. With regard to the fulfilment of the prophecy, we may fairly quote in the first place <a href="../../par/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-4</a>. The agents in the desolation there referred to (still fresh in Malachi's recollection) are probably the Nabathaeans (an Arab race, though writing Aramaic), who, after occupying Edom, dropped their nomad habits, devoted themselves to commerce, and founded the kingdom of Arabia Petraea. Meantime the Edomites maintained an independent existence in the midst of the Jewish colonists, till John Hyrcanus compelled them to accept circumcision about  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. In spite of this enforced religious and political union, the Edomites remained perfectly conscious of their nationality, and we find them mentioned as a distinct factor in the community in Josephus' account of the great Jewish war. They pass away from history after the destruction of Jerusalem, A.D. 70. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Teman</span> was celebrated for its "wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a practical moral philosophy, similar to that which we find in the less distinctly religions portions of the Book of Proverbs. It was this "wisdom" which formed the common element in the higher culture of the Semitic peoples, and of which the sacred narrator speaks when he says that "Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-30.htm">1 Kings 4:30</a>). One of Job's friends, Eliphaz, was a Temanite (<a href="../../par/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a>). From ver. 20, however, it appears that Teman is here used for Edom in general, of which it formed a part. "Wisdom" was doubtless cultivated throughout Idumaea (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8</a>), the "land of Uz," in which Job dwelt, was probably in the east of Edom (see on Jeremiah 25:20). <span class="cmt_word">Is their wisdom vanished?</span> The Hebrew, with its characteristic love for material symbols, has, "Is their wisdom poured out?" So in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-7.htm">Jeremiah 19:7</a>, "I will pour out [a different word, however, is used] the counsel of Judah." The body being regarded as a vessel, it was natural to represent the principle of life, both physical (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>) and intellectual (as here), under the symbol of a liquid. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-8.htm">Jeremiah 49:8</a></div><div class="verse">Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time <i>that</i> I will visit him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn back.</span> The grammatical form is peculiar (literally, <span class="accented">be made to turn back</span>).

The Dedanites, it will be remembered, were a tribe devoted to commerce (see on Jeremiah 25:23). Isaiah had already, on an earlier occasion, given the same advice as Jeremiah, viz. to leave the beaten track and take refuge in a less exposed part of the desert, where shrubs and thorn bushes ("the forest," or rather, "the thickets") would secure them to some extent from observation (<a href="../../par/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>).

Jeremiah, to justify his adoption of the outward form of his prophecy, declares that he is personally responsible for its substance. "Rumour," or as the word is elsewhere rendered, "report," is a technical term for a prophetic revelation (<a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-22.htm">Isaiah 28:22</a>); and it is from this Old Testament usage that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span> acquires its special meaning in <a href="../../par/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>. In fact, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;</span>, or bearing, is a more exact equivalent of the original. A prophet is one who has "listened in the council of God" (<a href="../../par/job/15-8.htm">Job 15:8</a>, corrected version; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>), and "when the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who can but prophesy?" (<a href="../../par/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>). Prophetic perception of Divine truth is so exceptional a thing that it can only be expressed approximately in terms of everyday life. One while it may be called a "hearing," a "report," another while a "vision" or "intuition." He who makes to hear or see is, of course, Jehovah, through the objective influence of his Spirit. It is important to study the Biblical phraseology, which has a depth of meaning too often overlooked, owing to the blunter edge which time has given to our modern speech. <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a herald.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Unto the heathen;</span> rather, unto <span class="accented">the nations.</span> There is no religious idea involved; the word <span class="accented">goyim</span> literally means "nations," and there is no reason for deviating from the primary sense.

The root-meaning is simply "continuance," whether it be continuance of strength (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>, Hebrew) or of the flow of a stream (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">Deuteronomy 21:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-24.htm">Amos 5:24</a>), or, as here, of the perennial verdure of a well watered pasturage. <span class="cmt_word">But I will suddenly make him run away from her.</span> Make whom? The lion? Such is the natural inference  from the Authorized Version, but the context absolutely forbids it. It seems useless to mention the crowd of explanations which have been offered of this "obscure and much-vexed passage," as old Matthew Poole calls it, since in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-44.htm">Jeremiah 50:44</a> we have precisely the same phrase, but with another suffix, which clears up the meaning. We may, therefore, either <span class="accented">read</span> (with the Septuagint and the Syriac Version), "For I will suddenly make them run away from it" (viz. the pasture), or keep the old reading "him" for "them," and explain "him" as meaning the Edomites. The expression used for "suddenly" is very forcible; we might render, with Ewald, "in the twinkling of an eye." <span class="cmt_word">And who is a chosen man,</span> etc.? A still more difficult clause. If the text is correct, which cannot be assumed as certain, we should probably render, with Ewald, "and will appoint over it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the land of Edom] him who is chosen," viz. Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Who will appoint me the time?</span> The same phrase is rendered in <a href="../../par/job/9-19.htm">Job 9:19</a>, "Who shall set me a time to plead?" (comp. the Latin phrase <span class="accented">dicur dicere</span>). To drag a defendant before the tribunal implies equality of rank. One might venture to do this with Nebuchadnezzar, if he were not the representative of One still mightier. Finally, <span class="cmt_word">Who is that shepherd that will stand before me?</span> The land of Edom has been likened to a pasture; it is natural that the ruler should be now described as a shepherd (comp.

(The third of the Aramaean kingdoms, that of Zobah, had ceased to exist.) Damascus had already been threatened by Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3-5</a>), and by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/17-1.htm">Isaiah 17:1-11</a>). We may infer from the prophecy that Damascus had provoked the hostility of Nebuchadnezzar, but we have as yet no monumental evidence as to the facts. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. Still an important city under the name of Hamah, situated to the north of Hums (Emesa), on the Orontes. It formed nominally the boundary of the kingdom of Israel (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), was actually a part of the empire of Solomon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), and was conquered for a short time by Jeroboam II. (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). Under Sargon it was fully incorporated into the Assyrian empire (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>); rebellious populations were repeatedly transplanted into the territory of Hamath. <span class="cmt_word">Arpad</span>. Always mentioned together with Hamath, whose fate it appears to have shared (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a>).

There is <span class="cmt_word">sorrow on the sea</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> even the sea participates in the agitation of that troublous time: somewhat as in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> the sea is represented as sympathizing in the terror produced by a Divine manifestation. But by the slightest possible emendation (viz. of <span class="accented">caph</span> into <span class="accented">beth</span>) we obtain a more natural sense - "with an unrest <span class="accented">as of</span> the sea, which cannot be quiet." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a> we read, "For the ungodly are like the troubled sea, for it cannot be quiet;" and it can hardly be doubted that Jeremiah is alluding to this passage. If he altered it at all, it would be in the direction of greater smoothness rather than the reverse. Not a few manuscripts of Jeremiah actually have this corrected reading, which should probably be adopted.

This, however, does  not suit the context, which shows that "the daughter of Damascus" personified is the speaker, so that ver. 25 ought rather to mean, "How is it that the city of praise <span class="accented">is</span> [not, '<span class="accented">is not'</span>] forsaken?" Either, then, we must suppose that "not" has been inserted by mistake - a too arbitrary step, seeing that there is no negative in the context to account for the insertion (the case is different, therefore, from <a href="../../par/job/21-30.htm">Job 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-15.htm">Job 27:15</a>, where such an insertion is at any rate justifiable); or else we must give <span class="accented">uzzebhah</span> the sense of "let go free" (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-5.htm">Exodus 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>; <a href="../../par/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>).

The title places this prophecy later than these in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-1.htm">Jeremiah 48:1-49:33</a>; viz. at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah. From this filet, and from the absence of any reference to Nebuchadnezzar as the instrument of Elam's humiliation, Ewald conjectures that the Elamites had been concerned in the events which led to the dethronement and captivity of Jehoiachin. Dr. Payne Smith is inclined to accept this hypothesis, remarking that the Elamites "appear perpetually as the allies of Merodach-baladan and his sons in their struggles for independence." We are not yet, however, in  possession of information as to the relations of Elam to the great Babylonian empire which rose upon the ruins of the Assyrian. Ewald's conjecture is a possibility, and no more. And what was Elam? One of the most ancient kingdoms in the world (see <a href="../../par/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.). Geographically it was the tract of country., partly mountainous, partly lowland, lying south of Assyria and east of Persia proper, to which Herodotus gives the name of Cissia, and the classical geographers that of Tusis or Tusiaua. This is clear, says Sehrader, from the Persian text of the Behistun inscription of Darius. It is fro-quently mentioned under the name "Ilam," or "Ilamti," in the Assyrian inscriptions, especially in those of Sargon, Sennacherib, and Assurbauipal. In B.C 721 Sargon states that he annexed a district or province of Elam (and hence, perhaps, we must explain the mention of the Elamites in the Assyrian army in <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), which was, doubtless, one cause of the embittered feeling towards Assyria of the portion which remained independent. The annals of the heroic struggle of Merodach-baladan contain repeated reference to the King of Elam. Assurbanipal made no less than three invasions of Elam, and the singular pretext for the third is, curiously enough, associated with the remarkable fourteenth chapter of Genesis. It was this - that the Elamite king had refused to deliver up an image of the goddess Nana, which Kudur-nankhundi, an ancient Elamite monarch, had carried oft, and which had remained 1635 or (perhaps) 1535 years in Elam. This king has been plausibly conjectured to be a member of the same dynasty as "Chedorlaomer [  =   Kudur-Lagamar] King of Elam." This time it was all over with Elam; Shushan itself was plundered and destroyed, and far and wide the country was laid waste. That so restless and courageous a people should have become famous among the surrounding nations was only to be expected; and it is a striking proof of this that Ezekiel, in describing the companions whom fallen Egypt would meet with in Hades, mentions "Elam and all her multitude" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>). The fact that the Septuagint has the heading twice over - first very briefly (in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-14.htm">Jeremiah 25:14</a>, where it is followed by this prophecy), and then at full length (in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-1.htm">Jeremiah 26:1</a>, at the end of the prophecy of Elam) - has been variously explained. It is, at any rate, clear that there is some confusion in the present text of this translation. In connection with this prediction it is interesting to notice one of the results of a new cuneiform discovery among some tablets acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. At the very time when Nebuchadnezzar was taking an oath of allegiance from Zedekiah, he was also engaged in hostilities against Elam. "We do not know," says Mr. Pinches, "what brought the Babylonians into hostilities with the Elamites, but the result of the expedition was to bring the whole kingdom of Elam within the boundaries of the Babylonian monarchy" (<span class="accented">Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 7:214).

The fact is that, both in the narrative in the Acts and in this prophecy, the Elamites are chiefly mentioned as representatives of the distant and less civilized Gentile nations, and the fulfilment is granted whenever a similar people to the Elamites is brought to the knowledge of the true religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/48.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 48"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 48" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/50.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 50"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 50" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/jeremiah/4.htm"><title>Jeremiah 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/jeremiah/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/jeremiah/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/jeremiah/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../jeremiah/3.htm" title="Jeremiah 3">&#9668;</a> Jeremiah 4 <a href="../jeremiah/5.htm" title="Jeremiah 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-1.htm">Jeremiah 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - The form and structure of the translation require a change.

The clause, "and not wander," seems too short; the Septuagint had a choicer reading, "and put away, etc., from his [thy] mouth, and not wander from before me." It is the close of the prophecy which we have here. The prophet subjoins a promise which he has heard from Jehovah. True, it does not appeal to Israel's self-love (as <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-18.htm">Isaiah 48:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-13.htm">Psalm 81:13-16</a>), but to a nobler feeling of responsibility for the world's welfare. Israel has been entrusted with a mission, and on the due performance of this mission hangs the weal or woe of humanity. Hence Jehovah's longing for Israel's repentance. If Israel will but "return," and obey God's commandments, all nations will be attracted to the true religion. The form of expression used for the latter statement is borrowed probably from <a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a> (it is less closely parallel with <a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>). To "bless <span class="accented">by"</span> any one is to use his name in the benediction formula. Seeing Israel so blessed through his allegiance to Jehovah, all nations shall wish themselves a similar blessing (the reverse of the process in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>). To "swear, As Jehovah liveth," means to call Jehovah to witness to the truth of a statement. This is to be done "with good faith," etc., <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">the</span> object of the oath must be consistent with honesty and probity.

We have other instances of as sudden a transition from the Israelites (in the narrower sense) to the men of Judah (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-6.htm">Isaiah 8:6-14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-1.htm">Isaiah 28:1-6</a>; in the writer's commentary). <span class="cmt_word">For thus</span>, etc. "For" is here not causal, but explanatory: "I say this not only to the men of Israel, but to you, O men of Judah, who need the admonition to repentance, how deeply!" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-2.htm">Jeremiah 5:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Break up your fallow ground</span>; the same figure as in <a href="../../par/hosea/10-12.htm">Hosea 10:12</a>. To understand it we must read the clause in connection with the following one. <span class="cmt_word">Sow not among thorns</span>. The prophet means, though he does not say so, the roots which will spring up into thorns. "Do not plant your good resolutions in a heart filled up with the roots of thorns, but first rake up the soil, and clear it of noxious germs, and then sow the seed which will grow up in a holy life" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>).

A significant passage. All the Jews were circumcised, but not all were "circumcised to the Lord." There were but too many who were "circumcised in uncircumcision" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a>), and the prophet sternly reduces ouch circumcision to the level of the heathenish rite of cutting off the hair (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; comp. Herod. 3:8). Jeremiah seems to have been specially anxious to counteract a merely formal, ritualistic notion of circumcision, sharing in this, as in other points, the influence of the Book of Deuteronomy, so lately found in the temple (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>). To him the venerable rite of circumcision (older, certainly, than Abraham) is a symbol of the devotion of the heart to its rightful Lord (comp. St. Paul in <a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-31.</span> - A revelation of grievous purport has suddenly reached the prophet. See how the foe draws nearer and nearer, and how alarm drives the scattered population to seek for refuge in the fortified cities. Can such be the issue of the promises of peace with which Jehovah has encouraged his people? Such are the contents of the first paragraph (vers. 5-10). Next,-in short, detached figures the prophet sets forth the sin of the people and its punishment. Like a scorching simoom is the former; like swift clouds, and like a whirlwind, is the onward march of the instruments of the latter. Swift, indeed, must repentance be, if it is to outrun punishment. For the northern peoples are already here (vers. 11-18). The impression is so strong on the mind of the prophet that he vents himself in language such as the last man might employ on the morrow of the final judgment day (vers. 19-26). And now, "lest what precedes might seem only poetry" (Payne Smith), the Divine decree is solemnly announced. The judgment is irrevocable; but there is a gleam of hope: "I will not make a full end." On the question whether the Scythians or the Baby-Ionians are mainly alluded to, see Introduction.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cry, gather together</span>; rather, <span class="accented">cry aloud</span>.

The same verb in Ethiopic means "to be mad." The "heart" in Old Testament language is the center of the intellectual as well as of the moral life (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/12-24.htm">Job 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-28.htm">Proverbs 15:28</a>). So St. Ephrem the Syrian says ('Works,' in Syriac, 2:316, quoted by Delitzsch), "The reason expatiates in the heart as in a palace." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ah, Lord God</span>! rather, Alas! O <span class="accented">Lord Jehovah</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> on Jeremiah 1:6). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast greatly deceived this people</span>, etc. Much difficulty has been felt in interpreting this verse, partly because it seems directly to charge Jehovah with "deceit," and partly because the prophecy, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall have peace</span>, on which this charge is founded, accords exactly with the strain of the "false prophets" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>). Hence some (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ewald) have altered the points of the verb at the beginning of the verse., so as to enable them to render. "And one shall <span class="accented">say</span>," <span class="accented">the</span> subject understood being either a "false prophet" or one of the people. This view is not in itself impossible (Keil's objection will not bear  examination), but is not absolutely necessary, for the present is not the only passage in which Jeremiah, under the influence of strong emotion, charges Jehovah with "deceit" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-7.htm">Jeremiah 20:7</a>, a synonymous word is used; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-23.htm">1 Kings 22:23</a>), and the words, "Ye shall have peace, may be meant to summarize the cheering promises in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-14.htm">Jeremiah 3:14-18</a>. Jeremiah may (it is not incorrect to conjecture) have supposed the fulfillment of his prophecy to be nearer than it really was (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>); hence his disappointment, and hence his strong language. So St. Jerome, "Quia supra dixerat, In illo tempore vocabunt Jerusalem solium Dei, etc.. et nunc dicit, Peribit cor regis, turbatur propheta et in se Deum putat esse meutitum; nec intelligit, illud multa post tempera repromissum, hoc autem vicino futurum tempore." To suppose, with Keil, that Jeremiah refers the prophecies of the "false prophets" to God as their ultimate Author, seems inconsistent with Jeremiah's own statements in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-14.htm">Jeremiah 14:14</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-13.htm">Jeremiah 5:13</a>). Moreover, we have parallels elsewhere in the prophets, as well as in the Book of Job, for the use of language with regard to Providence which a calmer judgment would condemn. A notable instance is <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-17.htm">Isaiah 63:17</a>, where the Jewish Church, through its mouthpiece the prophet, throws the responsibility of its errors upon Jehovah. Depressed by melancholy, they give way for the moment to those human "thoughts" which are not as "My thoughts." They felt the "burden of the mystery." <span class="cmt_word">Unto the soul</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. unto the life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-11.htm">Jeremiah 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall it be said to this people</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. words like these may be used with <span class="accented">reference</span> to this people. <span class="cmt_word">A dry wind</span>, etc.; literally, a clear wind (but the notions of dryness and heat are closely connected with that of heat; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>). The prophet doubtless means the east wind, which is very violent in Palestine, and, of course, quite unsuitable for the winnowing process. <span class="cmt_word">High places</span> should rather be bare <span class="accented">hills</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Toward</span>; or (is) the way cf. So Hitzig, supposing the conduct of the Jews to be likened to a wind which brings no blessing, but only drought and desolation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-12.htm">Jeremiah 4:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Even</i> a full wind from those <i>places</i> shall come unto me: now also will I give sentence against them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even a full wind from those places</span>. The passage is obscure, but this is a very possible rendering.  "Full," equivalent to "violent;" "those (places)," equivalent to the bare hills spoken of in ver. 11. Keil and Payne Smith, however, render, "a fuller wind than those," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a more violent wind than those which serve for winnowing the corn; while Hitzig (see on ver. 11) supposes "from those" to mean the persons described in ver. 11 as "the daughter of my people." <span class="cmt_word">Unto me</span>; or perhaps for me, at my beck and call. <span class="cmt_word">Now also will I</span>, etc. We must supply the other term of the antithesis from the context: "As they have sinned against me, so will I also now hold a court of justice upon them" (see on Jeremiah 1:16).

The phrase specially belongs to sins against one's neighbor - such sins as are described in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5-9</a> (Keil). "Vain" should rather be "wicked" (immoral); the root-meaning of the noun is "a breath" (the symbol of material or moral emptiness).

It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation. Ver. 19 reminds us of <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a> and Isaiah 21:3, 4, and would be quite in harmony with the elegiac tone of our prophet elsewhere; the Targum too already regards the passage as an exclamation of the prophet. On the other hand, the phrase "my tents" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!<br />The walls of my heart! My heart moaneth unto me!<br />I cannot hold my peace!<br />For thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,<br />The alarm of war!"</span> Observe, the "soul" hears; the "heart" is pained. So generally the one is more active, the other more passive. The Hebrew margin gives, for "I must writhe," "I must wait" (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/7-7.htm">Micah 7:7</a>); but this rendering does not suit the context. <span class="cmt_word">The walls of my heart</span>.

But why is "the earth" mentioned in this connection? Because the judgment upon Judah is but one act in the great general judgment which, when completed, will issue in a fresh order of things (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-14.htm">Isaiah 3:14, 15</a>, where side by side are mentioned Jehovah's judgment of "the peoples" and of "his people," and <a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24</a>, where the judgment upon the enemies of Israel is interwoven with the judgment upon "the earth"). <span class="cmt_word">Without form, and void</span>; rather, waste <span class="accented">and</span> wild (to represent in some degree the characteristic assonance of the original - tohu <span class="accented">va-bohu</span>); more literally, <span class="accented">immovable and lifeless</span>.

And as this operation is performed by dipping first into this powder a small wooden bodkin of the thickness of a quill, and then drawing it afterwards through the eyelids over the ball of the eye, we have a lively image of what the prophet (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>) may be supposed to mean" (Shaw, 'Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 229).

Bel, it is true, was originally distinct from Merodach, but ultimately identified with him. Merodach was the tutelary god of Babylon, and Nebuchadnezzar seems to have been specially addicted to his worship, though, indeed, he mentions Nebo also with hardly less honour. This is the beginning of an inscription of this king's, preserved at the India House: - "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, glorious prince, worshipper of Marduk, adorer of the lofty one, glorifier of Nabu, the exalted, the <span class="accented">possessor</span> of intelligence" (Mr. Rodwell's translation, 'Records of the Past,' 5:113). Elsewhere Nebuchadnezzar speaks of Marduk as "the god my maker," "the chief of the gods," and of himself as "his (Marduk's) eldest son, the chosen of his heart." Her images. It is a very peculiar word (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), specially frequent in Ezekiel, and also found in a chapter of Leviticus with which Ezekiel has affinities (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>). It evidently involves a sore disparagement of idol worship. The etymological meaning is "things rolled," which may be variously interpreted as "idol blocks" (Gesenius), or "doll images" (Ewald).

The burnt offering was to be sacrificed on the north side of the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>), and the four cherubim, in the vision of Ezekiel, are described as coming from the north (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>). The horror with which Babylon was regarded was intensified, apparently, by its northern position (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>), and now the "hidden" north again pours forth its swarms of warriors against Babylon herself. <span class="cmt_word">They shall remove, they shall depart;</span> rather, <span class="accented">they are fled, they are gone</span>; almost the same clause occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-10.htm">Jeremiah 9:10</a>.

But the description of the latter is a remarkable one. We are by no means to regard it as an idealized  picture of the return of the Jews under Zerubbabel, any more than we can suppose the glowing promises in the second part of Isaiah to have their sole fulfilment in that disappointing event. No; it is the characteristic of Messianic prophecy that, with "foreshortened perspective," the prophets represent as equally near events which are really separated by ages. In the Book of Isaiah, for instance, preliminary judgments are repeatedly described in terms which, properly speaking, only apply to the great final judgment. In fact, each great political revolution is a stage in the Divine drama of judgment, which will reach its close in the final cataclysm. And so too here (as well as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-46</a>.) the promise of mercy to Israel, which began to be fulfilled in the edict of Cyrus, is represented as if the still future conversion of the people of Israel were actually accomplished.

Probably enough an actual geographical name may lie at the root of this singular expression; but we are not able at present to say what it was. The prophet has, at any rate, modified it in such a way as to convey a definite meaning, symbolic of the character of Babylon (comp. on ver. 31). What was this meaning? According to Gesenius, there is an allusion to the two great blows inflicted on Israel and Judah by Assyria and Babylon respectively; but as these two powers were but the instruments of a higher Hand, this explanation would seem to be inconsistent with the prophetic teaching. Dahler, De Wette, and Keil take the two rebellions to be the spiritual ones of idolatry and pride; and there is no obvious objection to this. But the dual may be simply intended to express intensity; comp. ch. 17:18, "Destroy them with double destruction" (see note). <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of Pekod</span>; <span class="accented">i.e</span>. of punishment. But here too a geographical name very probably lies underneath. The Taylor cylinder inscription of Sennacherib mentions a Pukudu (  =   Pekod), together with Havrann (Hauran) and Nabatu (Nabathaeans); but this was the name of a tribe. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-23.htm">Ezekiel 23:23</a> we read, "The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa," etc.; and in 'Records of the Past,' 11:92, we find a town Pikudu mentioned, lying to the south of Babylon, which may, perhaps, have given its name to a district, and to this district the prophet not improbably alludes. M. Halevy conjectures that the event which corresponds to the prophecy is the decisive battle which virtually terminated the Babylonian empire. According to the newly discovered Cyrus inscription, this battle was fought near a place called Rutu, which appears to have been situated in the neighbourhood of Pukudu ('Records,' <span class="accented">l.c.</span>). About the symbolic meaning there can be no doubt: Pekod is a worthy pendant to Merathaim. Sin and punishment are so closely connected in the prophetic mind that one word sometimes  covers both notions. It is doubtful, for instance, whether the better rendering of <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-18.htm">Isaiah 5:18</a> is "draw sin as with a cart rope" or "draw punishment."

In the next chapter a similar title is conferred upon Israel, with the right to retaliate upon Babylon all the evil which Babylon had done to Zion (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20-24</a>). Compare the epithet <span class="accented">Martel</span>, "The Hammer," given to Charles, Duke of the Franks, on account of his great victory over the Saraoens at Tours; it is tempting to add "Makkabi," the epithet of Judas (Maccabaeus), but the <span class="accented">k</span> is not the same letter as that in <span class="accented">maqqab</span>, hammer.

But the cylinder inscription, translated by Sir H. Rawlinson in 1880, shows that Babylon opened its gates of its own accord, on hearing the defeat and capture of Nabonidus. There is no occasion to look for any further fulfilment of the prophecy than the surprise which must ever come upon the bystander when he sees a mighty empire suddenly pass into the hands of its enemies.

A truly grand figure. The north country (the "hidden" part of the earth, as it was called in Hebrew) is regarded by the prophet as a storehouse of young and "inexhaustible" nations, from which Jehovah can at any time "bring forth weapons of his indignation." The latter phrase, occurs again in the parallel prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-5.htm">Isaiah 13:5</a>), where it is evidently applied to the army of Medo-Persian invaders. <span class="cmt_word">For this is the work,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">For the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, hath a work</span>.

Dr. Payne Smith infers that Babylon has already fallen, and that the persons addressed are not warriors only, but plunderers of every kind. This is almost too subtle.

The Hebrew has <span class="accented">leb-kamai</span>, which is <span class="accented">Kasdim</span>, or <span class="accented">Chaldea</span>, written in the cypher called Athbash (see on Jeremiah 25:26); just as <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> in ver. 41 is equivalent to Babel. The question arises whether the prophet himself is responsible for this covert way of writing, or a scribe in later times (so Ewald). In favour of the former view it may be urged that Babylon and Chaldea receive symbolic names (though not in Athbash) in the connected chapter (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-21.htm">Jeremiah 50:21, 31, 32</a>); in favour of the latter, that the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 1, and does not express Sheshach in ver. 41, also that the clause to which Sheshach belongs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a> is of very dubious genuineness. <span class="cmt_word">A destroying wind;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the spirit</span> (<span class="accented">ruakh</span>) <span class="accented">of a</span> <span class="accented">destroyer</span> (or perhaps, of <span class="accented">destruction</span>). The verb rendered in this verse "raise up," when used in connection with <span class="accented">ruakh</span>, always means "to excite the spirit of any one" (ver. 11; <a href="../../par/haggai/1-14.htm">Haggai 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>).

This is supported by the Septuagint, Peshito, Targum, Vulgate, according to the Massoretic pointing, however, we should render "enemies." Possibly the prophet intended to suggest both meanings, <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">o</span> being so nearly related. <span class="cmt_word">Shall empty her land.</span> The original has a much mere striking word, shall pour out (for the figures, comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-12.htm">Jeremiah 48:12</a>), which occurs again in similar contexts in <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> (Hebrew, 2).

The difficulty, however, is in the first two words of the clause, which are the same in either reading. It would be much simpler to alter a single point, and render, "Let not the archer bend his bow; and let him not lift himself up in his coat of mail" (for the old word "brigandine," see on Jeremiah 46:4); which might be explained of the Babylonians, on the analogy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-6.htm">Jeremiah 46:6</a>, "Let him not bend his bow, for it will be useless;" but then the second half of the verse hardly suits the first - the prohibitions seem clearly intended to run on in a connected order. On the other hand, the descriptions, "him that bendeth," and "him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine," seem hardly a natural way of putting "the Chaldean army."

(Golden cups were not unknown in Palestine; Jehu sent some to Shalmaneser; Smith, 'Assyrian Canon,' p. 114.) So, in Nebuchadnezzar's vision of the image, the head of the image is of gold (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32, 38</a>).

The Hebrew, more forcibly, has "is broken." The Authorized Version wished, perhaps, to avoid the objection that a golden cup could not, properly speaking, be broken. But if we once begin to harmonize the language of Hebrew poetry, we shall have no end. It is not the cup which falls, but the state, considered as a house (the "breach" of God's people is constantly referred to; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Howl for her</span>.

The latter view is probably the best. How could Babylon be said to shatter her own "governors" and "viceroys" (for the prophet deliberately chooses the  Babylonian official names)? The argument from the context is not very weighty; for it is clear that the connection of the parts of this prophecy is very loose. We may assume, then, that ver. 20 begins a fresh paragraph, standing quite apart from that which precedes.

Babylon, it should be remembered, was divided nearly in half by the Euphrates. It was guarded, says Professor Rawlinson, "by two walls of brick, which skirted them along their whole length. In each of these walls were twenty-five gates, corresponding to the number of the streets which gave upon the river; and outside each gate was a sloped landing place, by which you could descend to the water's edge, if you had occasion to cross the river. Boats were kept ready at these landing places to convey passengers from side to side; while for those who disliked this method of conveyance, a bridge was provided of a somewhat peculiar construction" ('Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514). <span class="cmt_word">The reeds they have burned with fire.</span> This rendering is no doubt tenable, though it gives an unusual meaning to the first noun. The "reeds" would be those of the marshes in the neighbourhood of Babylon; and Kimchi suggests that these would be cut down to facilitate the entrance of the army into the city, Surely a very forced explanation. The natural meaning of the first noun is "pools" or "lakes," and, considering that Herodotus (1:185) speaks of a lake in connection with the defences of Babylon, it has been thought (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> by Vitringa) that the prophet may refer to something which was to happen to this and similar lakes; "burned with fire" is then regarded as a hyperbolical expression equivalent to "dried up" (comp. ver. 36). This, however, is hardly less forced than the first interpretation; and we seem almost compelled to assume s corruption of the text, and to read (for '<span class="accented">agammin</span>) '<span class="accented">armonim</span>, palaces. If "palaces" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> lofty houses, for such is the etymological meaning) were not uncommon at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), much more frequent must they have been at Babylon, Or perhaps the prophet refers to the two magnificent royal palaces, which, together with the temple of Bel, constituted the wonders of Babylon. They were on opposite sides of the river, and were guarded with triple enclosures, the circumference in the one case amounting to sixty stadia (nearly seven miles), and in the other to thirty (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 2:514, etc.).

Ewald and others render thus: "Not only must Babylon fall, O ye slain ones of Israel, but slain ones of the whole earth have fallen because of Babylon." But why this address to the slain ones of Israel? Besides, the antithesis indicated in the Hebrew is thereby destroyed. Hell explains the antithesis thus: "Just as Babylon was intent on the fall of slain ones in Israel, so also there fall because of Babylonian slain ones of all the earth," viz. because there are to be found, in the capital of the empire, people from all quarters of the world, who are slain when Babylon is conquered. A better antithesis seems to be gained if we follow the Peshito, and read, at the end of the verse, "in the whole earth." It will then be asserted by the prophet that, just as Babylon was the cause of the slaying of Israelites, so (as a punishment) the Babylonian fugitives shall be slain wherever they may wander.

A similar phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-7.htm">Jeremiah 8:7</a>. "Judgment (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>) here (as in some other passages) has acquired a technical sense.

That the poet had Jeremiah in his mind cannot be doubted. The deep knowledge of the Scriptures possessed by medieval theologians (and such was Dante) may put many Protestants to shame. Curiously enough, whereas the early commentators on Dante interpret these wild beasts of vices, the moderns find historical references to nations. On the other hand, while modern expositors explain Jeremiah's wild beasts as symbols of calamities, Rashi and St. Jerome understand them of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. <span class="cmt_word">A lion out of the forest.</span> The first of a series of figures for the cruel invaders of Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>).

But the reading of the received Hebrew text, though somewhat more difficult, is yet perfectly capable of explanation; and, slight as the difference is in the reading adopted by Ewald (it involves a mere shade of pronunciation), it is not to be preferred to the received reading.

The "adultery" may be taken both in a literal and in a figurative sense, and so also the "harlots' houses" in the next clause. It is also well worthy of consideration whether the prophet may not be referring to certain matrimonial customs handed down from remote antiquity and arising from the ancient system of kinship through women (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>).

There is a doubt about "walls," which should, as some think, rather be <span class="accented">vine-rows</span> (a change of points is involved; also of shin into sin - the slightest of all changes), or shoots, or branches (comparing the Syriac). The figure would thus gain somewhat in symmetry. However, all the ancient interpreters (whose authority, overrated by some, still counts for something) explain the word as in the Authorized Version, and, as Graf remarks, in order to destroy the vines, it' would be necessary to climb up upon the walls of the vineyard. (For the figure of the vine or the vineyard, scrap, on Jeremiah 2:21.) <span class="cmt_word">Take away... not the Lord's</span>. The Septuagint and Peshito read differently, translating "leave her foundations, for they are the <span class="accented">Lord's"</span> (supposing the figure be taken from a building). As the text stands, it is better to change <span class="cmt_word">battlements</span> into <span class="accented">tendrils</span>. Judah's degenerate members are to be removed, but the vine-stock, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>., the behooving kernel of the nation, is to be left. It is the key-note of the "remnant" which Jeremiah again strikes (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-27.htm">Jeremiah 4:27</a>).

Does not this aptly convey the impression which a long-civilized nation (and the Jews, who have been called "rude," were only so by comparison with the Egyptians and Assyrians) must derive from the tumultuous incursions of nomad hosts? The description-will therefore fit the Scythians; but it is not inappropriate to the Chaldeans, if we take into account the composite nature of their armies. <span class="cmt_word">An ancient nation</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">one</span> which still occupies its primeval seat in the north (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22</a>), undisturbed by invaders. <span class="cmt_word">Whose language thou knowest not.</span> So Isaiah of the Assyrians, "(a people) of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand."

The political rank of Jerusalem, as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, makes it difficult to realize that Jerusalem was not locally a city of Judah at all. It belonged, strictly speaking, to the tribe of Benjamin, a tribe whose insignificance, in comparison with Judah, seems to have led to the adoption of a form of expression not literally accurate (see Psalm 128:68). The true state of the case is evident from an examination of the two parallel passages, <a href="../../par/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7, 8</a>, and Joshua 18:16, 17. As Mr. Fergusson points out, "The boundary between Judah and Benjamin... ran at the foot of the hill on which the city stands, so that the city itself was actually in Benjamin, while, by crossing the narrow ravine of Hinnom, you set foot on the territory of Judah" (Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:983).

And yet these highly favored "children of Benjamin" are divinely warned to flee from their sacred homes (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4-7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gather yourselves to flee</span>; more strictly, <span class="accented">save your goods by flight</span>. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a> the same advice was given to the inhabitants of the country districts. There, Jerusalem was represented as the only safe refuge; here, the capital being no longer tenable, the wild pasture-land to the south (the foe being expected from the north) becomes the goal of the fugitives of <span class="accented">Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>In Tokoa</span>. Tokoa was a town in the wild hill-county to the south of Judah, the birthplace of the prophet Amos. It is partly mentioned because its name seems to connect it with the verb rendered <span class="cmt_word">blow the trumpet</span>. Such paronomasiae are favorite oratorical instruments of the prophets, and especially in connections like the present (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10-15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A sign of fire in Beth-hakkerem</span>; rather, <span class="accented">a signal on Beth-hakkerem</span>. The rendering of Authorized Version was suggested by <a href="../../par/judges/20-38.htm">Judges 20:38, 40</a>; but there is nothing in the present context (as there is in that passage) to favor the view that a fiery beacon is intended. Beth-hakkerem lay, according to St. Jerome, on an eminence between Jerusalem and Tekoa; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably the hill known as the Frank Mountain, the Arabic name of which (<span class="accented">Djebel el-Furaidis</span>, Little Paradise Mountain) is a not unsuitable equivalent for the Hebrew (Vineyard-house). The "district of Beth-hakkerem" is mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Nehemiah 3:14</a>. The choice of the locality for the signal was a perfect one. "There is no other tell," remarks Dr. Thomson, "of equal height and size in Palestine." <span class="cmt_word">Appeareth</span>; <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">bendeth forward</span>, as if it were ready to fall.

This passage is one of the most difficult in the book, and if there is corruption of the text anywhere, it is here. The most generally adopted rendering is, "The comely and delicate one will I destroy, even the daughter of Zion," giving the verb the same sense as in <a href="../../par/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> (literally it is, <span class="accented">I have brought to silence</span>, or perfect of prophetic certitude). The context, however, seems to favor the rendering "pasturage" (including the idea of a nomad settlement), instead of "comely;" but how to make this fit in with the remainder of the existing text is far from clear. The true and original reading probably only survives in fragments. Ver. 3 - <span class="cmt_word">The shepherds with their flocks</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">To her came shepherds with their flocks</span>; <span class="accented">they have pitched their tents round about her</span>; <span class="accented">they have pastured each at his side</span>.

The foes are dramatically described as urging each other on at the different stages of the campaign. The war is to be opened with sacrifices (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a> with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>); next there is a forced march, so as to take the city by storm, when the vigilance of its defenders is relaxed in the fierce noontide heat (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>); evening surprises the foe still on the way, but they press steadily on, to do their work of destruction by night. The rapidity of the marches of the Chaldeans impressed another prophet of the reign of Josiah - Habakkuk (see <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto us! for the day goeth away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">Alas for us! for the day hath turned</span>.

"To go up" is the technical term for the movements of armies, whether advancing (as here and <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1</a>) or retreating (as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5, 11</a>).

Hewing down trees was an ordinary feature of Assyrian and Babylonian expeditions. Thus, Assurnacirpal "caused the forests of all (his enemies) to fall" ('Records of the Past,' 3:40, 77), and Shalmaneser calls himself "the trampler on the heads of mountains and all forests "(Ibid. p. 83; comp. p. 90). The timber was partly required for their palaces and fleets, but also, as the context here suggests, for warlike operations. "Trees," as Professor Rawlinson remarks, "were sometimes cut down and built into the mound" (see next note); they would also be used for the "bulwarks" or siege instruments spoken of in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cast a mount</span>; literally, <span class="accented">pour a mount</span> (or "bank," as it is elsewhere rendered), with reference to the emptying of the baskets of earth required for building up the "mount" (mound). Habakkuk (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-10.htm">Habakkuk 1:10</a>) says of the Chaldeans, "He laugheth at every stronghold, and <span class="accented">heapeth up earth</span>, and taketh it" (comp, also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>). The intention of the mound was not so much to bring the besiegers on a level with the top of the walls as to enable them to work the battering-rams to better advantage (Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:472). <span class="cmt_word">She is wholly oppression</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">she is the city that is punished</span>; <span class="accented">wholly oppression is in the midst of her</span>.

The ear is constantly dinned with the sounds of oppression, and the eye pained with the sight of the bodily sufferings of the victims. The word for" sickness" is applicable to any kind of infirmity (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3, 4</a>), but the context clearly limits it here to bodily trouble.

The phrase equivalent to "receive correction" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-30.htm">Jeremiah 2:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-3.htm">Jeremiah 5:3</a>), and means to accept the warning conveyed in the Divine chastisement.

Unwilling as the people are to hear it, the disclosure must be made. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall thoroughly glean</span>, etc. "Israel" has already been reduced to a "remnant;" the ten tribes have lost their independence, and Judah alone remains (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-15.htm">Jeremiah 5:15</a>). Even Judah shall undergo a severe sifting process, which is likened to a gleaning (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-13.htm">Isaiah 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-9.htm">Jeremiah 49:9</a>).

If the text is correct, the speaker here addresses the leader of the gleaners. Keil thinks this change of construction is to emphasize the certainty of the predicted destruction. But it is much more natural (and in perfect harmony with many other similar phenomena of the received text) to suppose, with Hitzig, that the letter represented in the Authorized Version By "thine" has arisen by a mistaken repetition of the first letter of the following word, and (the verbal form being the same for the infinitive and the imperative) to render <span class="accented">turning again the hand</span>. In this case the clause will be dependent on the preceding statement as to the "gleaning" of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">Into the baskets</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto the shoots</span>. The gleaners will do their work with a stern thoroughness, laying the hand of destruction again and again upon the vine-shoots.

The text has "pour it out." The sudden transition to the imperative is certainly harsh, and excuses the <span class="accented">conjectural emendation</span> which underlies the rendering of the Authorized Version. If we retain the imperative, we must explain it with reference to Jeremiah's inner experience. There are, we must remember, two selves in the prophet (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6</a>), and the higher prophetic self here addresses the lower or human self, and calls upon it no longer to withhold the divinely communicated burden.

There is, however, no other passage in which the word has this reference. The words rendered "what is among them," or "what (shall happen) in them," seem unnaturally laconic, and not as weighty as one would expect after the solemn introduction. If correct, they must of course refer to the Israelites. But Graf's conjecture that the text is corrupt lies near at hand. The least alteration which will remove the difficulties of the passage is that presupposed by the rendering of Aquila (not Symmachus, as St. Jerome says; see Field's 'Hexapla') and J. D.

Possibly this was to avoid a supposition which might have occurred to some readers (it has, in fact, occurred to several modern critics) that the "only son" was Adonis, who was certainly "mourned for" by some of the Israelites under the name of Thammuz (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), and whose Phoenician name is given by Philo of Byblus as <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;</span> (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. probably <span class="accented">Yakhidh</span>, only begotten, the word used by Jeremiah; comp. <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;</span>, equivalent to Berith). M. Renan found a vestige of the ancient festival of Adonis at Djebeil (the Phoenician Gebal) even at the present day. There would be nothing singular in the adoption of a common popular phrase by the prophet, in spite of its reference to a heathen custom (comp. <a href="../../par/job/3-8.htm">Job 3:8</a>), and the view in question gives additional force to the passage. But the ordinary explanation is perfectly tenable and more obvious. The phrase, "mourning [or, 'lamentation'] for an only begotten one," occurs again in <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>. In the last-mentioned passage it is parallel with "bitter weeping for a firstborn." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-27.htm">Jeremiah 6:27</a></div><div class="verse">I have set thee <i>for</i> a tower <i>and</i> a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have set thee</span>, etc.; literally, <span class="accented">as an assayer have I set thee among my people</span>, <span class="accented">a fortress</span>. Various attempts have been made to avoid giving the last word its natural rendering, "a fortress." Ewald, for instance, would alter the points, and render "a separator [of metals]," thus making the word synonymous with that translated "an assayer;" but this is against Hebrew usage. Hitzig, assuming a doubtful interpretation of <a href="../../par/job/22-24.htm">Job 22:24</a>, renders "... among my people without gold," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "without there being any gold there for thee to essay" (a very awkward form of expression). These are the two most plausible views, and yet neither of them is satisfactory. Nothing remains but the very simple conjecture, supported by not a few similar phenomena, that <span class="accented">mibhcar</span>, a fortress, has been inserted by mistake from the margin, where an early glossator had written the word, to remind of the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, "I have made thee this day a fortress-city," '<span class="accented">it mibhcar</span>). In this and the following verses metallurgic phraseology is employed with a moral application (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22, 25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a></div><div class="verse">They <i>are</i> all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: <i>they are</i> brass and iron; they <i>are</i> all corrupters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grievous revolters</span>; literally, <span class="accented">rebels of rebels</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Walking</span>; rather, <span class="accented">going about</span>, as a peddler with his wares (so <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-19.htm">Proverbs 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>).

The objection to this rendering is that the burning of the bellows would involve the interruption of the process of assaying. We might, indeed, translate "are scorched" (on the authority of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-4.htm">Ezekiel 15:4</a>), and attach the word rendered "of the fire" to the first clause; the half-verse would then run: "The bellows are scorched through the fire; the lead is consumed," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the bellows are even scorched through the heat of the furnace, and the lead has become entirely oxydized. But this requires us to alter the verb from the masculine to the feminine form of third sing. perf. (reading <span class="accented">tammah</span>). It is better, therefore, to give the verb (which will be Kal, if the <span class="accented">nun</span> be radical) the sense of "snorting," which it has in Aramaic and in Arabic, and which the corresponding noun has in Hebrew (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/39-20.htm">Job 39:20</a>; <a href="../../par/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>). The masculine form of the verb rendered "is consumed" is still a difficulty; but we have a better right to suppose that the first letter of <span class="accented">tittom</span> was dropped, owing to its identity with the second letter, than to append (as the first view would require us) an entirely different letter at the end. This being done, the whole passage becomes clear: "The bellows puff, (that) the lead may be consumed of the fire." In any case, the general meaning is obvious. The assayer has spared no trouble, all the rules of his art have been obeyed, but no silver appears as the result of the process. Lead is mentioned, because, before quicksilver was known, it was employed as a flux in the operation of smelting, <span class="cmt_word">Plucked away</span>; rather, <span class="accented">separated</span>, like the dross from the silver.

The phrase is repeated three times to express earnestness of the speakers (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-29.htm">Jeremiah 22:29</a>, "O earth, earth, earth"). These false prophets evidently retained a large amount of the old materialistic faith of the Semitic nations (to whom the Israelites belonged by race), which localized the presence and the power of the divinity. The temple was, in fact, their palladium, and as long as it stood, the national independence appeared to them to be secured. They faithfully handed on the teaching of those prophets of the last generation, who, as Micah tells us (<a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), were wont to "lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us."

Jeremiah attacks this false confidence in the temple of Jerusalem, by pointing to the destruction of an earlier sanctuary, of which very little is known, indeed only so much as to give an edge to our desire for more. It is certain, from <a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>, that the tabernacle and the ark found a resting-place at Shiloh (an Ephraimitish town to the north of Bethel), nearly the whole of the period of the judges, or more exactly between the latter days of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) and the death of Eli (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3</a>). Manifestly, then, there must have been some sort of "house," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. temple, at Shiloh; a mere tent would not have been sufficient for so long a period. This presumption is confirmed by the language of Jeremiah, and by the expressions of the narrative books. The fate which the prophet is bidden to announce for the existing temple is analogous to that which fell upon "Jehovah's place in Shiloh." The latter was, therefore, not merely a deportation of the ark, such as is referred to in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>. And when the narrator of the times of Samuel speaks of Eli as "sitting by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-9.htm">1 Samuel 1:9</a>), is it more natural to suppose t the word "temple" is here applied to the tabernacle, or that there was really a house, however rude, as sacred in the eyes of the faithful as was afterwards the splendid temple at Jerusalem? The latter view is strongly confirmed by <a href="../../par/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, "All the time that the house of God in Shiloh existed" (Authorized Version is misleading), and <a href="../../par/judges/19-18.htm">Judges 19:18</a>, where the Levite travelling to Mount Ephraim says, "I am going to the house of Jehovah." It is no doubt strange at first sight that so little information is given us as to this central sanctuary of the true religion; but are there not other omissions (especially in the history of the judges), which are equally strange as long as we look upon the Old Testament as primarily an historical document? We do know something, however, and more than is generally suspected; for when the right translation is restored in <a href="../../par/judges/18-31.htm">Judges 18:31</a>, it follows, from a comparison of this and the preceding verse, that the temple of Shiloh was destroyed simultaneously with the captivity of the northern tribes. The impression produced by this emphatic announcement of Jeremiah is revealed to us by a later passage in his book (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26.htm">Jeremiah 26</a>.).

The word is peculiar (<span class="accented">kavvanim</span>), and perhaps entered Palestine together with the foreign rite to which the cakes belonged. Various conjectures have been offered as to their nature, but without any demonstrable ground. Sacrificial cakes were not uncommon. Hosea refers to the luscious raisin-cakes used by idolaters (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To the queen of heaven.</span> This title of a divinity only occurs in Jeremiah (here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17-19, 25</a>). It reminds us, first, of titles (such as "queen of the gods") of the Babylonic-Assyrian goddesses, Bilat (Beltis) and Istar, who, though divided in later times, were "originally but two forms of the same goddess" (Sayce, <span class="accented">Transactions of Society of Biblical Archaeology</span>, 3:169). It is, however, perhaps an <span class="accented">objection</span> to the view that Bilat or Istar is intended, that neither here nor in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44.htm">Jeremiah 44</a>. is there any allusion to that characteristic lascivious custom which was connected in Babylonia with the worship of Istar (Herod., 1:199). The phrase has, however, another association. It reminds us, in the second place, of the Egyptian goddess Neith, "the mother of the gods." The first mention of "the queen of heaven" in Jeremiah occurs in the reign of Jehoiakim, who was placed on the throne by Pharaoh-Necho, one of the Saite dynasty (Says was the seat of the worship of Neith). If the "queen of heaven" were a Babylonic-Assyrian goddess, we should have looked for the introduction of her cultus at an earlier period (e.g. under Ahaz). But it was in accordance with the principles of polytheism (and the mass of the Jews had an irresistible tendency to polytheism), to adopt the patron-deity of the suzerain. Subsequently Judah became the subject of Nebuchadnezzar; thus it was equally natural to give up the worship of an Egyptian deity. Jewish colonists in Migdol would as naturally revert to the cultus of the Egyptian "mother of the gods" (see Gratz, 'Monatsschrift,' Breslau, 1874, pp. 349-351). The form of the word rendered "queen" being very uncommon, another reading, pronounced in the same way, obtained currency. This should be rendered, not "frame," or "workmanship" (as Authorized Version, margin), but "service." The context, however, evidently requires a person.

Inferentially, this doctrine appears from the narrative of the Fall, and still more clearly from Isaiah's description of Paradise regained (11.). Hosea speaks of sufferings of the animals arising out of the guilt of Israel (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>), and a consciousness of the "solidarity" of all living creatures is ascribed to a Ninevite king in the Book of Jonah (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7, 8</a>). In general, the origin of this community of suffering is left mysterious, but in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12</a> it is expressly stated as the cause of the Deluge, that "all flesh [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. both man and beast.] had corrupted its way upon the earth;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. apparently, that contact with man had led to a corruption of the original innocence of the lower animals. It is a common experience that intercourse between Christianized (not to say civilized) man and the domestic animals produces a sometimes pathetic change in the psychic phenomena of the latter. Is the reverse process utterly inconceivable?

The prophet here appears to deny <span class="accented">in tote</span> that Jehovah at Mount Sinai had given any injunctions on the subject of sacrifice. But the prophet must at any rate be consistent with himself; he cannot utter anything by Divine command which is fundamentally at variance with other equally authoritative declarations. Do the statements of Jeremiah elsewhere justify us in accepting <span class="accented">the</span> words in their literal, superficial meaning? There are three other passages which have a claim to be considered. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-26.htm">Jeremiah 17:26</a> the prophet draws a picture of the happy condition in which the Jews might be, were they only obedient. One of the features of this picture is that the Jews would still bring all the various kinds of sacrifices to the house of Jehovah. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-14.htm">Jeremiah 31:14</a> a similar description is closed with the promise to "satiate the soul of the priests with fatness," implying that there would be a great abundance of thank offerings in regenerate Israel. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Jeremiah 33:11</a>, among other blessings of the future, the prophet mentions the praiseful exclamations of those who would bring the sacrifice of thanksgiving. These passages do not contain any statement respecting the origin of the sacrificial system; but they do expressly assert that Jehovah contemplates that system with pleasure, and apparently that he designs it to be permanent among his people Israel. Let us now turn to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-17.htm">Jeremiah 33:17-24</a>. Here the prophet, in the Name of Jehovah, declares that there is a Divine covenant "with the Levites, the priests," who shall never "want a man before me... to do sacrifice continually." A covenant with the priests implies a covenant with the people, the priests being the representatives of the people. This passage, therefore, is more distinct than those previously quoted; it does appear to maintain that the range of the Sinaitic covenant included the duties of the priesthood, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sacrifices. On the other hand, it should be observed that the genuineness of this latter passage is not beyond dispute, the whole section in which it occurs (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-14.htm">Jeremiah 33:14-26</a>) being omitted in the Septuagint. We have now to inquire, Is there a real discrepancy between the words of Jeremiah (strictly speaking, of Jehovah) in the verse now before us, interpreted literally, and the passages adduced above? Are they more inconsistent than such an utterance as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a> (first half of verse), which appears to deny the utility of sacrifices altogether? If the latter may be explained as a forcible oratorical exaggeration, why not also the present passage? Jeremiah sees the people attaching a pernicious importance to the opus <span class="accented">operatum</span> of sacrifice. On one occasion he tells them that Jehovah cares not for sacrifices; he means, as the context shows, the sacrifices of men without spiritual sensibilities. On another, that Jehovah never commanded their fathers to sacrifice; he means (may we not presume?) the mere outward forms of the ritual, divorced from the sentiment and practice of piety, which, as Hosea tells us (<a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>), Jehovah "delights in and not [equivalent to 'more than'] sacrifice." There is, therefore, no fundamental inconsistency between the passage before us and the three passages first quoted, and if so there can be no real discrepancy with the last-mentioned passage, for the priests (as was remarked) perform their functions on behalf of the people, and the permanence of Jehovah's covenant with the priests depended on the spiritual life of the people they represented (read <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33.htm">Jeremiah 33</a>, as a whole). This view seems less arbitrary than that of Ewald, who thinks that the sacrifices spoken of in our passage are merely the free-will offerings of the rich; and than that of Dahler, who interprets, "My chief care was not to prescribe rules for holocausts and sacrifices, but this is what I commanded thee above all," viz. moral obedience. According to it, the prophet's denial is not absolute, but relative - relative, that is, to the notion of sacrifices entertained by the Jews whom he addresses. Of course, Graf's view, that the denial is absolute, will equally well suit the context. The people were surprised at Jeremiah's objurgations, because they thought they had fulfilled the claims of the covenant. Jeremiah's purpose is equally well fulfilled whether his denial is qualified or unqualified, absolute or relative. Our object has been to separate the exegesis of our passage from a still doubtful controversy, and to offer a tenable view of it, based upon grounds purely internal to Jeremiah. It may be suggested, however, to the student of Leviticus, that even if the Levitical legislation in its present form were proved to be of a pest-Exile date, it would still be doubtful whether any believing temple-worshipper could help assuming that Jehovah had, from the first existence of the nation, given his direct sanction to the offering of sacrifices. If so, it is comparatively unimportant (except with regard to the progressive revelation of the strictness of the law of truth) whether the Levitical code was given to Moses at Mount Sinai in its present form or not.

These birds are again mentioned together in <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a> (the psalm of Hezekiah), where special reference is made to the penetrating quality of their note. "The whooping or trumpeting of the crane rings through the night air in spring, and the vast flocks which we noticed passing north near Beersheba were a wonderful sight." The introduction of the swallow in the Authorized Version is misleading, as that bird is not a regular migrant in Palestine. The note of the swift is a shrill scream. "No bird is more conspicuous by the suddenness of its return than the swift," is the remark of Canon Tristram, who saw large flocks passing northwards over Jerusalem, on the 12th of February ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 208). It is an interesting fact that the swift bears the same name (<span class="accented">sus</span>) in the vernacular Arabic as in the Hebrew of Jeremiah. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment</span>; better, <span class="accented">the law</span> (see on Jeremiah 5:4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">How do ye say, We <i>are</i> wise, and the law of the LORD <i>is</i> with us?

Jeremiah is evidently addressing the priests and the prophets, whom he so constantly described as among the chief causes of Judah's ruin (comp. Ver. 10; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-9.htm">Jeremiah 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>), and who, in Isaiah's day, regarded it as an unwarrantable assumption on the part of that prophet to pretend to instruct them in their duty (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-9.htm">Isaiah 28:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The law of the Lord is with us</span>. "With us;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in our hands and mouths. (comp. Psalm 1:16). The word <span class="accented">torah</span>, commonly rendered" Law," is ambiguous, and a difference of opinion as to the meaning of this verse is inevitable. Some think these self-styled "wise" men reject Jeremiah's counsels on the ground that they already have the divinely given Law in a written form (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>), and that the Divine revelation is complete. Others that <span class="accented">torah</span> here, as often elsewhere in the prophets (e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-4.htm">Isaiah 42:4</a>), simply means "instruction," or "direction," and describes the authoritative counsel given orally by the priests (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>) and prophets to those who consulted them on points of ritual and practice respectively. The usage of Jeremiah himself favors the latter view (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-8.htm">Jeremiah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>; and especially Jeremiah 26:4, 5, where "to walk in my <span class="accented">Torah"</span> is parallel to "to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets." The context equally points in this direction. The most natural interpretation, then, is this: The opponents of Jeremiah bade him keep his exhortations to himself, seeing that they themselves were wise and the divinely appointed teachers of the people. To this Jeremiah replies, not (as the Authorized Version renders) <span class="cmt_word">Lo, certainly in vain made he it</span>, etc.; but, <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">behold I for a lie hath it wrought - the lying pen of the scribes</span> (so Authorized Version, margin). <span class="accented">Soferim</span> (scribes) is the term proper to all those who practiced the art of writing (<span class="accented">sefer</span>); it included, therefore, presumably at least, most, if not all, of the priests and prophets of whom Jeremiah speaks. There are indications enough that the Hebrew literature was not entirely confined to those whom we look up to as the inspired writers, and it is perfectly credible that the formalist priests and false prophets should have availed themselves of the pen as a means of giving greater currency to their teaching. Jeremiah warns his hearers to distrust a literature which is in the set-vice of false religious principles - a warning which prophets in the wider sense of the term ('The Liberty of Prophesyings') still have but too much occasion to repeat, tit is right, however, to mention another grammatically possible rendering, which is adopted by those who suppose <span class="accented">torah</span> in the preceding clause to mean the Mosaic Law: "Yea, behold, the lying pen of the scribes hath made (it) into a lie;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the professional interpreters of the Scriptures called scribes have, by their groundless comments and inferences, made the Scriptures (especially the noblest part, the Law) into a lie, so that it has ceased to represent the Divine will and teaching. The objections to this are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the necessity of supplying an object to the verb - the object would hardly have been omitted where its emission renders the meaning of the clause so doubtful; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that this view attributes to the word <span class="accented">soferim</span> a meaning which only became prevalent in the time of Ezra (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6, 11</a>).]

The phrase to pass away is constantly used of an invading host; e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10, 40</a>.

It is a little difficult to find a rendering which shall suit all the passages in which <span class="accented">rosh</span> (gall) is mentioned. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> (and so <a href="../../par/job/20-16.htm">Job 20:16</a>) it is clearly used for "venom" in general; and yet in Ver. 32 of the same chapter it obviously means a plant. Another general application of the term seems to have been to bitterness in general, the ideas of bitterness and poisonousness being taken as interchangeable. The Authorized Version may therefore stand.

Some species of highly venomous serpent is clearly intended; more than this we cannot say. The root probably means "to hiss." Canon Tristram thinks of "a very beautifully marked yellow serpent, and the largest of the vipers found in the Holy Land," called the <span class="accented">Daboia xantheina</span>.

The people again becomes the speaker. The form of the speech reminds one of a proverb. When the harvest was over and the fruit-gathering ended, the husbandmen looked for a quiet time of refreshment. Judah had had its "harvest-time" and then its "fruit-gathering;" its needs had been gradually, increasing, and, on the analogy of previous deliverances (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-4.htm">Isaiah 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-10.htm">Isaiah 33:10</a>), it might have been expected that God would have interposed, his help being only delayed in order to be the more signally supernatural. <span class="cmt_word">But we are not saved</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">delivered</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Is there</i> no balm in Gilead; <i>is there</i> no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - No hope or remedy is left; again a proverbial expression. <span class="cmt_word">No balm in Gilead</span>. Gilead appears to have been celebrated in early times for its balsam, which was expected by Ishmaelites to Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>) and by Jewish merchants to Tyro (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>). It was one of the most costly products of Palestine (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>), and was prized for its medicinal properties in cases of wounds (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-11.htm">Jeremiah 46:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-8.htm">Jeremiah 51:8</a>). Josephus mentions this balsam several times, but states that it only grew at Jericho ('Antiq.,' 15:4,2), Tristram searched for balsam in its ancient haunts, but in vain; he thinks Jeremiah means the <span class="accented">Balsamodendron gileadense</span> or <span class="accented">opobalsamum</span>, which in Arabia is used as a medicine both internally and externally. But if Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 24:22) may be followed in his wide use of the term "balsam" so as to include the exudations of the "lentisens" or mastick tree, then "balm of Gilead" is still to be found; for the mastick tree "grows commonly all over the country, excepting in the plains and the Jordan valley" ('Nat. Hist. of Bible,' p. 336). <span class="cmt_word">Is there no physician there?</span> We hear but little of physicians in the Old Testament. They are only mentioned again in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> (but with reference to Egypt, where medicine was much cultivated), and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-12.htm">2 Chronicles 16:12</a>; <a href="../../par/job/13-4.htm">Job 13:4</a>. From the two latter passages we may, perhaps, infer  that physicians were rarely successful; and this is certainly the impression produced by Ecclus. 38:15, "He that sinneth before his Maker, let him fall into the hand of the physician." The remedies employed in the Talmudic period quite bear out this strong saying (see Lightfoot, 'Horae Hebraical,' on <a href="../../par/mark/5-26.htm">Mark 5:26</a>). The physicians of Gilead, however, probably confined themselves to their one famous simple, the balsam. <span class="cmt_word">Is not the health...  recovered</span>?

There is a sad, stern irony in these words, which remind us of Isaiah's (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-22.htm">Isaiah 5:22</a>) "valiant men - for drinking wine" and of our own prophet's repetition of himself in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10</a>, "Their valor is - untruth."

Such was the result of clinging to an unprogressive religion - one which refused to be spiritualized by the prophets. Certainly, if the established religion was so inefficacious, it was self-condemned. Hero we find the prophet depicting a state of society in which the elementary bonds are already dissolved, and suspicion becomes the natural attitude even of a good man. We find a very similar picture in the last chapter of Micah - a chapter, it is true, which stands apart from the rest of the book, as it implies a greater development of wickedness than the rest of Micah and the contemporary prophecies of Isaiah would lead us to expect. Are these prophetic descriptions just and accurate? We may allow something, no doubt, for the warmth of feeling natural to every human preacher, even under the influence of inspiration; but we must not allow ourselves to explain away the obvious meaning of the prophets. The latter and their disciples were "the salt" of their country; and in proportion as their influence declined, the natural effects of a non-moral, purely ritualistic religion showed themselves on a larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">Every brother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. every fellow-tribesman or fellow-citizen. <span class="cmt_word">Will utterly supplant</span>. There is nothing in the context to suggest an allusion to <a href="../../par/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> (Jacob). The verb has its common sense of deceiving. The tense should be the present, not the future, both here and in the next verse. <span class="cmt_word">Will walk</span>; rather, <span class="accented">goeth about</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>).

Purification, not destruction, is the object of the judgment which is threatened! Strange that mercy should find place, after the offence of the criminal has been found so grievous l But, lest we should expect too favorable an issue, the prophet adds, in the name of Jehovah, <span class="cmt_word">For how shall I do</span>? or rather, <span class="accented">How should I act? How otherwise should I act?</span> The continuation is a little doubtful. The Hebrew has," by reason of the daughter of my people;" but this can hardly be right.

To give an idea of the greatness of the impending blow, all the skilled mourners are sent for to raise the cry of lamentation. But no, this is not enough. So large will be the number of the dead that all the women must take their part in the doleful office. The description of the mourning women is as true to modern as to ancient life in the East. "And, indeed," says Dr. Shaw, a thoughtful traveler and an ornament of Oxford in the dark eighteenth century, "they perform their parts with such proper sounds, gestures, and commotions, that they rarely fail to work up the assembly into some extraordinary pitch of thoughtfulness and sorrow" ('Travels in Barbary and the Levant,' 2nd edit., p. 242; comp. <a href="../../par/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a>).

(For the figure, comp. <a href="../../par/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">The children from without</span>. The ideal of Zechariah is that "the streets of the city should be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof" (Jeremiah 8:5). But the pitiless reaper, Death, shall cut off even "the playful child from the street" (so we might render more literally). Streets, in the parallel clause, means the "broad places" where men congregate to toll the news. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-22.htm">Jeremiah 9:22</a></div><div class="verse">Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall gather <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak, Thus saith the Lord</span>.

The following words are mistranslated in the Authorized Version, and should run, not <span class="cmt_word">even</span>, but <span class="accented">and</span>, <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the carcasses of men shall fall</span>; etc. It is most improbable, however, that a fresh Divine revelation should begin with "and." With other points, the word rendered "speak" would mean "pestilence." Possibly the word fell out of Ver. 21, where it would find an excellent place in the second clause (as an explanatory parallel to "death," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-50.htm">Psalm 78:50</a>), which would thus obtain greater roundness and symmetry. <span class="cmt_word">As the handful</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as thickly as one heap of corn succeeds another under the deft hand of the leaper. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise <i>man</i> glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty <i>man</i> glory in his might, let not the rich <i>man</i> glory in his riches:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - These two verses were hardly composed for their present position, though a connection may, of course, be thought out for them. Perhaps a comparison of <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17, 18</a>, may help us. There the prophet looks forward to a complete desolation resulting from the Chaldean invasion, and yet declares that he can even exult in his God. So here. All subjects of boasting have been proved untrustworthy; but one remains - not wisdom, not valor, not riches, but the knowledge of the revealed God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-24.htm">Jeremiah 9:24</a></div><div class="verse">But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I <i>am</i> the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these <i>things</i> I delight, saith the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The knowledge of God relates to three leading attributes, the combination of which is very instructive. <span class="cmt_word">First, loving-kindness.</span> This is not to be understood in a vague and general sense of the love of God to all mankind; the term has a special connotation with regard to the Israelitish people. God shows loving-kindness to those with whom he is in covenant; hence the combination "loving-kindness and faithfulness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>, corrected version), and as here (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/5-7.htm">Psalm 5:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5, 6</a>), "mercy and righteousness." Israel is weak and erring, and needs mercies of all sorts, which Jehovah, in his "loving-kindness," vouchsafes. <span class="cmt_word">Next, judgment, or justice.</span> Jehovah is a King, helps the poor and weak to their right, and punishes the wrong-doer (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-12.htm">Jeremiah 21:12</a>). Then, <span class="cmt_word">righteousness</span> - a similar but wider term. This is the quality which leads its subject to adhere to a fixed rule of conduct. God's rule is his covenant; hence "righteousness" shows itself in all such acts as tend to the full realizing of the covenant with Israel, including the "plan of salvation." It is by no means to be confined to exacting penalties and conferring rewards. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-25.htm">Jeremiah 9:25</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all <i>them which are</i> circumcised with the uncircumcised;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - A further enforcement of the doctrine that no outward privileges, if dissociated from inward moral vitality, will avail. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - All them which are <span class="cmt_word">circumcised with the uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the circumcised in uncircumcision</span>, or, as Ewald turns it, "all the uncircumcised-circumcised." But what does this enigmatical expression signify? Hitzig, Graf, and apparently Dr. Payne Smith, think that it has a twofold meaning: that, as applied to the Jews, it means circumcised in the flesh, but not in heart, and, as applied to the heathen, simply uncircumcised (the one-half of the phrase neutralizing the other, like "a knife without the blade," "angels with horns and hoofs," etc.). The latter meaning, however, is surely very improbable, and it would only become necessary if it were proved that circumcision was practiced by none of the nations mentioned but the Jews. This is not the case. There is no doubt that the Egyptians were circumcised in very early times (see the drawing of a bas-relief in the Temple of Chunsu at Karnak, given by Dr. Ebers in his 'Egypten und die Bucher Meets'). The assertion that only the priests underwent the operation has no older evidence than that of Origen (edit. Lommatzsch, 4:138), "in whose time it is quite possible that the Egyptians, like the later Jews, sought to evade a peculiarity which exposed them to ridicule and contempt." As to the Ammonites and Moabites, we have, unfortunately, no information. With regard to the Edomites, it is true that, according to Josephus ('Antiq.,' 13:9, 1), they were compelled to accept circumcision by John Hyrcanus. But it is still quite possible that, at an earlier period, the rite was practiced, just as it was among the ancient Arabs, the evidence for which is beyond question (see the writer's article, "Circumcision," in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 9th edit.). (On the statement that "all these [the] nations are uncircumcised," see below.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a></div><div class="verse">Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all <i>that are</i> in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all <i>these</i> nations <i>are</i> uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel <i>are</i> uncircumcised in the heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All that are in the utmost corners</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all that</span> <span class="accented">are corner-clipped</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. that have the hair cut off about the ears and temples. Herodotus tells us, speaking of the Arabs, "Their practice is to cut the hair in a ring, away from the temples" (3:8); and among the representatives of various nations, colored figures of whom are given in the tomb of Rameses III., we find some with a square place shaved just above the temples. The hair below this shaven place was allowed to grow long, and then plaited into a leek. It is to such customs that Jeremiah alludes here and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-23.htm">Jeremiah 25:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-32.htm">Jeremiah 49:32</a>. A prohibition is directed against them in the Levitical Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all these nations are uncircumcised</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the nations</span>, etc. Another obscure expression. Does it mean (taken together with the following clause), "The Gentile peoples are uncircumcised in the flesh, and the people of Israel is equally so in heart?" But this does not agree with facts (see above, on Ver. 25). It is safer, therefore, to assume that "uncircumcised" is equivalent to "circumcised in uncircumcision" (Ver. 25). The next clause will then simply give the most conspicuous instance of this unspiritual obedience to a mere form. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jeremiah/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jeremiah 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jeremiah/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jeremiah 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jeremiah 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
