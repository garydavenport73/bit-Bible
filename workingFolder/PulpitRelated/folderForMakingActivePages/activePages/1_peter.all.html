It is the Greek form of the name, which the Lord Jesus himself had given to the great apostle; first, by anticipation, in the spirit of prophecy (<a href="../../par/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>); and again when the prophecy was already in a measure fulfilled, and Simon was proving himself to be indeed a stone, built upon the Rock of Ages, which is Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). It was his Christian name; he must have prized that name as the gift of Christ, reminding him always, of his confession and of the Savior's promise, urging him to maintain throughout life that rock-like steadfastness which was indeed characteristic of him, but in which he had more than once very sadly failed. The use of the Greek form seems to indicate that the Epistle was originally written in Greek, and gives some slight support to the view that it was addressed to Gentile converts as well as to Hebrew Christians. <span class="cmt_word">An apostle of Jesus Christ</span>. He does not add any assertion of the truth of his apostleship, as St. Paul often does; his apostolic dignity had not been questioned; the false brethren, who so often disputed the authority of St. Paul, had never assailed St. Peter. He does not join other names with his own in the address, though he mentions at the close of his Epistle Marcus - probably the John Mark who accompanied St. Paul in his first missionary journey - and Silvanus - probably the Silas of the Acts of the Apostles, and the Silvanus whom St. Paul associates with himself in addressing the Church of the Thessalonians. He describes himself as "an apostle of Jesus Christ." All Christians who knew the gospel history knew that St. Peter was one of the first-called apostles, one of the three who were nearest to the Lord, one who had received the apostolic commission in a marked and special manner direct from Christ. But he calls himself simply an apostle, not the prince of the apostles; he claims no superiority over the rest of the apostolic college. The impulsive forwardness which had once been the prominent defect in his noble character had passed away; he had learned that difficult lesson which the Lord had impressed upon the apostles when he set the little child among them as their example; he was now, in his own words, "clothed with humility." To the strangers scattered; literally, <span class="accented">to the elect sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus</span>, etc. "The dispersion" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) was the recognized term (comp. <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-35.htm">John 7:35</a>; 2 Macc. 1:27) for the Jews who were scattered over Gentile countries. The gospel of the circumcision was committed unto Peter (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7</a>); Paul and Barnabas were to go unto the heathen; James, Cephas, and John unto the circumcision (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>). But St. Peter had been taught to call no man common or unclean; he did not forget that God had made choice that the Gentiles by his mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe (<a href="../../par/acts/15-7.htm">Acts 15:7</a>); he can scarcely have intended to maintain in this Epistle that exclusiveness into which he once relapsed, and for which he was rebuked by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11-14</a>). He certainly uses the word here rendered "strangers" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) metaphorically in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a>);'and we cannot but think that, by "the sojourners of the dispersion," he means, not merely the Jewish Christians of Asia Minor, but all Christian people dispersed among the heathen. We shall see, as we proceed in the study of the Epistle, that the writer contemplates Gentile as well as Jewish readers. Those readers were sojourners for a brief time on earth (perhaps the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> marks the <span class="accented">passing</span> character of their sojourn). "Here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come;" they were dispersed here and there among the unbelievers, but they were one body in Christ. Compare Bengel's brief comment, "Advents in terra, in coelo, electis." Throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Bengel says," He mentions the five provinces in the order in which the names naturally occurred to one writing from the East." This is not precisely accurate, for Cappadocia lies to the south-east of Galatia, and Bithynia to the north-east of Proconsular Asia; but yet the general arrangement of the names seems to furnish a slight argument 'in favor of the view that the Babylon from which St. Peter wrote was the famous city on the Euphrates. The Churches of Galatia and Asia (by "Asia" St. Peter means Proconsular Asia, that is Mysia, Lycia, and Carla; Phrygia also was commonly reckoned as belonging to it, but not always, see <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9, 10</a>) were founded by St. Paul and his companions; those of Pontus possibly by Aquila, who, like the other Aquila who translated the Old Testament into Greek, was a Jew of Pontus (<a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>). Of Cappadocia all that we know from the New Testament is that dwellers in Cappadocia, as well as in Pontus and Asia, were in Jerusalem at the Pentecostal outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and heard the great sermon of St. Peter, by which three thousand souls were added to the Church. The Cappadocian Churches may have owed their origin to some of these men, or to some of St. Paul's converts from Galatia or Lycaonia. St. Paul himself had once "assayed to go into Bithy-nia, but the Spirit suffered them not" (<a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>); that province may have received the word of God from Troas; the famous letter of Pliny, written about the year 110, shows how widely the faith of Christ had spread throughout the district. We notice that the missions of the Church in Asia Minor had now covered a field considerably larger than that reached at the date of the Acts of the Apostles. We notice also that many of the Churches addressed by St. Peter were founded by St. Paul or his converts. There was no rivalry between the two great apostles. There had been jealousies among the twelve (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-1.htm">Matthew 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-24.htm">Matthew 20:24</a>, etc.); there had been differences between St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>); but they were children no longer - they were full-grown Christians now. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-2.htm">1 Peter 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Elect</span>. This word, in the Greek, is in the first verse; the Greek order is "to the elect sojourners of the dispersion." We begin already to notice coincidences with the teaching of St. Paul. St. Paul insists strongly on the doctrine of election; St. Peter holds it no less clearly. Holy Scripture constantly ascribes all that is good in us to the choice or election of God. The sacred writers do not enter into the many difficulties which lie around this central doctrine: they do not attempt to explain its relations to that other great truth, taught in Scripture and revealed in consciousness - the freedom of the human will; their statements of the two apparently conflicting doctrines balance, but do not explain, one another; they seem to recognize the fact that we are in the presence of an insoluble mystery; and they teach us by their silence that the proper attitude of the Christian, when brought face to face with mystery, is rest in the Lord, humble childlike confidence in his love and wisdom. According to the foreknowledge of God the Father. St. Peter sets in the forefront of his Epistle the mystery of the blessed Trinity and the Divine plan of human salvation. It is, however, a question whether the words just quoted should be taken, as in the Authorized Version, with "elect" or with "apostle." Many ancient authorities take the latter view. 'Thus we should have a description of St. Peter's apostleship, such as we often read at the opening of St Paul's Epistle. He was, like St. Paul, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God; he was chosen before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blame; like St. Paul, he had received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1, 5</a>). There is much to be said in favor of this connection. But, on the whole, the balance of the sentence, and the general usage of similar language in the New Testament, lead us to prefer the common view, and to regard St. Peter's words as a description of the origin, progress, and end of God's election. The origin is the grace of God the Father. He chose his elect before the foundation of the world. He predestinated them unto the adoption of children; and that according to the good pleasure of his will (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4, 5</a>). It is interesting to note that the substantive "foreknowledge" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs nowhere else in Holy Scripture except in St. Peter's Pentecostal speech (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). We mark the agreement of St. Peter and St. Paul (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>, "Whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son;" comp. also <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). Election is "<span class="accented">according</span> to the foreknowledge of God the Father;" but not simply, as the Arminians taught, <span class="accented">ex praevisis meritis</span>; for we cannot separate foreknowledge and predestination; the foreknowledge of an Almighty Creator must imply the exercise of choice and will; what he knoweth, that he also willeth; <span class="accented">eligendos facit Deus</span> (in the well-known words of St. Augustine), <span class="accented">non invenit</span>. Thus in ver. 20 "foreknown," the more exact rendering of the Revised Version must imply the "foreordained" of the old translation. But that foreknowledge is the foreknowledge of God the Father, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, but our Father also. He careth for his children; we must trust in him. The potter makes one vessel for honor, another for dishonor; but he makes none for destruction. A veil of awful mystery hangs round the relations which exist between the Almighty and his creatures; but "God is Love." Through sanctification of the Spirit; rather, <span class="accented">in</span>, as in the Revised Version. We have the same words in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which St. Peter uses here, is almost peculiar to St. Paul; it occurs eight times in his Epistles; once in the Epistle to the Hebrews; but elsewhere only here in the New Testament. Like other verbals of the same form, it may have either an active or a passive meaning. Perhaps the former is the more suitable here. God's election places the Christian in the sphere of the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit; he lives in the Spirit, he walks in the Spirit, he prays in the Holy Ghost; and the blessed Spirit sanctifieth the elect people of God: he worketh in them that holiness (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) without which they cannot see God (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>); they have their fruit, the fruit of the Spirit, unto holiness (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>). The fundamental idea of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which is represented by the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, seems to be, "separation, purity," though some connect it with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and regard it as meaning originally "fresh, new, young," and so "pure, shining, bright" (see Delitzsch, on <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>). By the word "spirit" we might, if we took the words apart from the context, understand the spirit of man, which is sanctified by the Holy Spirit of God; but the context shows that St. Peter is thinking of the work of the three blessed Persons of the Holy Trinity. Unto obedience. Obedience is the work of the Spirit; for the fruit of the Spirit is love, and "if a man love me, he will keep my words." Thus election has its origin in the foreknowledge of the Father; it is wrought out in the sanctifying influences of the Spirit as its sphere, and it issues in active obedience. Obedience is the sign and test of God's election: "By their fruits ye shall know them." The end of election is obedience first, then everlasting life. And sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. The word <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, sprinkling, occurs also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> (comp. also Hebrews 9:19). In both places there is an evident reference to the events related in <a href="../../par/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, where we read that "Moses took the blood, arid sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the Lord hath made with you." We observe that in this place also ceremonial sanctification (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10</a>) and the promise of obedience (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>) preceded the sprinkling of blood. "The blood of sprinkling" is called by the Lord himself the blood of the new covenant (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/14-24.htm">Mark 14:24</a>), the blood by which the covenant of grace was ratified and inaugurated. Moses sprinkled the blood of the old covenant once upon the people; the blood of the new covenant was shed once for all upon the cross; but it is ever fresh in its efficacy and power; still we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus; still, if we abide in him, we have our "hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience;" still, "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light,...  the blood of Jesus Christ his Son is cleansing us from all sin." Those who are elect unto obedience are elect unto the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ; the loving obedience of faith keeps them in the presence of the cross, within the cleansing range of the one all-sufficient sacrifice. Thus we have in this verse the concurrence of the three blessed Persons in the scheme of salvation - the choice of the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, the redeeming work of the Son. Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied. St. Peter uses the familiar salutation of St. Paul; possibly he quotes it, for he was plainly familiar with St. Paul's Epistles - he refers to them expressly in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15, 16</a>, and Sylvanus, the old companion of St. Paul, was now with him. He unites into one expression the Greek and Hebrew salutations, the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of the Greeks under its Christian aspect of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, the favor of God; and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrews - the peace which is the fruit of grace, which is the blessed possession of those on whom the favor of God abideth. That grace and peace is granted to all the elect of God. St. Peter prays that it may be multiplied, that his readers may be blessed with an ever-increasing measure of that heavenly gift. He uses the same form of salutation in his Second Epistle. It is interesting to observe that the phrase, "<span class="accented">Peace</span> be multiplied unto you," occurs also in the proclamation of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>), and in that of Darius (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>),both written in Babylon, the city from which St. Peter now sends the message of peace. The anarthrousness of these two verses is remarkable; in the original there is not one article in vers. 1, 2. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The Greek word rendered "blessed" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is used by the New Testament writers only of God; the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is said of men. St. Peter adopts the doxology used by St. Paul in writing to the Churches at Corinth and Ephesus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-3.htm">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>), the last being one of those to which this Epistle is addressed. It is a question whether the genitive, "of our Lord Jesus Christ," depends on both substantives or only on the last. The Greek will admit either view, and there are high authorities on both sides. On the whole, the first seems the most natural interpretation. The Lord himself had said, "I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God" (<a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>). He could not say, "our God," for the relations are widely different; he could say, "my God," as he had said upon the cross; for, in the well-known words of Theophylact, "he is both the God and the Father of one and the same Christ; his God, as of Christ manifest in the flesh; his Father, as of God the Word." So St. Paul, after using this same form of salutation in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>, speaks of God in the seventeenth verse as "the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory" (comp. also <a href="../../par/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-3.htm">Colossians 1:3</a>). Which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; rather, <span class="accented">begat</span>, as in the Revised Version. St. Peter refers our regeneration back to the great fact of the resurrection of Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is "the First-begotten of the dead" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>); we are "buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>). The Church, "which is his body" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-23.htm">Ephesians 1:23</a>), died with him in his death, rose with him in his resurrection. Christians individually are baptized into his death, "that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life" (<a href="../../par/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>). The resurrection of Christ was in a real sense the birth of the Church. Therefore St. Peter, who in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> speaks so strongly of the effect of holy baptism, here refers oar regeneration to that without which baptism would be an empty ceremony, the resurrection of our Lord. God's great mercy (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4, 5</a>, "God, who is rich in mercy.... hath <span class="accented">quickened</span> us together with Christ") is the first cause of our new birth, Christ's resurrection is the means through which it was accomplished. St. Peter alone of the New Testament writers uses the word here rendered "hath begotten again" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); it occurs also in ver. 23. But our Lord himself, and his apostles St. James and St. Paul, teach the same truth to similar words (see <a href="../../par/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). Some commentators, as Luther, Bengel, etc., connect the words, "by the resurrection," etc., not with "hath begotten us again," but with the word "<span class="accented">lively"</span> or "living" - a hope that liveth through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This connection is grammatically possible, and gives a good and true meaning; it is the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ which makes the Christian's hope living and strong; but the other explanation seems more natural, and is supported by such passages as <a href="../../par/romans/4-25.htm">Romans 4:25</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a> of this Epistle. The heavenly inheritance is the ultimate end of our regeneration; the hope of that inheritance is the present joy of the Christian life. St. Paul reminds the Ephesian Christians that when they were without Christ they had no hope (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>); but God according to his great mercy begat us again into a new life, and one important aspect of that new life is hope, the hope of ever-deepening fellowship with God now, of everlasting life with God in heaven. That hope is living; it is "pervaded with life, carrying with it in undying power the certainty of fulfillment (<a href="../../par/romans/5-5.htm">Romans 5:5</a>), and making the heart joyful and happy." (Huther); "it has life in itself, and gives life, and has life as its object" (De Wette). And it liveth, it doth not perish like the hopes of this world, but it lives on in ever fuller joy till it reaches its consummation in heaven; even there "hope <span class="accented">abideth</span>," <span class="accented">forever</span> in heaven there will be, it seems, a continual progress from glory to glory, nearer and nearer to the throne. St. Peter is the apostle of hope. "<span class="accented">He</span> loves," <span class="accented">says</span> Bengel, "the epithet living, and the mention of hope."

There are no tendencies to corruption there, no possibilities of defilement, not even that fading which must pass over the fairest things of earth. Reserved in heaven for you. The many mansions in our Father's house have been kept from the beginning, and still are kept for his elect; Satan cannot rob them of it, as he robbed man of the earthly paradise. Some of the Greek commentators find in the words, "in heaven," an argument against the millenarians. Some manuscripts read "for us," but the received reading is best supported. St. Peter passes from one person to another, as St. Paul often does, sometimes addressing his readers directly, sometimes including himself among them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Who are kept by the power of God. "Hereditas servata est," says Bengel, "heredes custodiuntur?" The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is a military word. "The governor under Areas the king <span class="accented">kept</span> [guarded] the city of the Damascenes" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>); the peace of God shall <span class="accented">keep</span> ("guard." <a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>) the hearts of those who trust in him, - they are guarded by a heavenly host; "The angel of the Lord encampeth around them that fear him;" they are guarded by, or rather, according to the exact rendering, <span class="accented">in</span> the power of God. His power is all around them; it is the sphere in which they live and move; no harm can reach them in that all-embracing shelter. Through faith. Faith, the evidence of things not seen, realizes the presence of the heavenly guard, and gives courage and confidence to the Christian when assailed by temptations and dangers; the servant of Elisha feared no more the hosts of Syria, when he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about his master. Faith is the instrument by means of which we grasp the Divine strength, so that it is made perfect in our weakness. Unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. By "salvation" St. Peter means not merely present deliverance from sin, but everlasting life, the joy of our Lord, the deep, full blessedness of his elect in heaven. Eye hath not seen it yet, it hath not entered into the heart of man. But it is ready to be revealed; the veil which now hides it from us will be withdrawn in the last time, when the last page of this world's history shall have been written, when the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and the eternal purpose of God shall have been fulfilled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherein ye greatly rejoice.</span> Is the word "wherein" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>) to be referred to the whole sentence, and to be understood of the Christian's present privileges and hopes? or is it to be taken in a temporal sense with the words immediately preceding it, "in the last time"? Authorities are divided. Of those who take the latter view some regard "the last time" - as the object of the Christian's joyful hope - he rejoices now in the hope of the glory of God; others give the verb a quasi-future sense - " wherein ye will greatly rejoice." But the former connection seems more natural; the Christian rejoices in his present and future blessings - in the new birth, in the hope of the heavenly inheritance, in the assured protection of God. The verb (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) is a strong expression; it means "to exult, to leap for joy." St. Peter may have had in his thoughts the well-remembered sermon on the mount, where the same word occurs (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>), and, as here, in connection with sorrows and persecutions. It is used of our Lord himself in <a href="../../par/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>, of the Philippian gaoler's joy in his newborn faith (<a href="../../par/acts/16-34.htm">Acts 16:34</a>), as well as of the joy of the blessed in heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>). There is, therefore, nothing unsuitable in taking the verb in its proper present signification; the Christian's experience is often, like St. Paul's, "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing." Some commentators, following St. Augustine, regard the verb as imperative. Though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations. The word rendered "for a season" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a little) may mean that the present suffering is but little compared with the future glory; it may cover both meanings (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, "Our light affliction, which is but for a moment"). St. Peter, like St. Paul, enforces the lesson that that light affliction, which seems sometimes so heavy, is sent in love and wisdom; the words, "if need be," imply his belief that these trials were necessary for his readers' salvation - they would work for them "a tar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." The words, "ye are in heaviness," represent the aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, having been put to grief; it refers to definite afflictions, known to St. Peter, which had been suffered by those to whom he is writing. The words, "manifold temptations," remind us of <a href="../../par/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That the trial of your faith.</span> The words of ver. 6, "if need be," point to the purpose and end of the temptations. St. Peter proceeds to develop his meaning. The word rendered "trial" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) means rather "test or proof;" it is explained by Dionysius of Halicarnassus ('Rhet.,' I1) as that at which, when one looks, he is able to form a judgment. Cremer says it is "not only the means of proof itself, e.g. the touchstone, but also the trace of the metal left thereon. Hence here and in <a href="../../par/james/1-3.htm">James 1:3</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is the result of the contact of faith with temptations, that in virtue of which faith is recognized as genuine - the verification of faith." Dr. Heft ('Notes on Select Readings') prefers the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is given by two of the better cursives. He says, "<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the instrument of trial, not even the process of trial, much less the thing fried; while it is only the thing tried that can be compared, as here, to gold refined in the fire." Compare the use of the cognate word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-9.htm">2 Corinthians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-4.htm">Romans 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>. Being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">more precious than gold</span>. Gold is the most precious of metals, faith is more precious far; the proof of faith is more momentous beyond all comparison than the proof of gold. Gold perishes; "Consumitur annulus usu," says the poet; "Aurum cummundo perit," says Bengel; but "Now abideth faith, hope, charity," says the apostle. Gold is tried with fire; as by the purifying fire gold is purged of dross (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>), so by the refining fire of temptations the faithful are cleansed from pride and self-reliance and the pollutions of sin.

The Christians of Asia Minor had not seen the gracious face of the Lord, as St. Peter had. But though they had never known him after the flesh, they knew him by the inner knowledge of spiritual communion, and, having learned to love him, had attained the blessing promised to those who had not seen, but yet had believed. St. Peter may possibly be thinking of his well-remembered interview with the risen Lord (<a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>). He has here the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span>, expressive of reverential love, which Christ had used in his first two questions; not the word of warm human affection (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ) which he himself had employed in his three answers. In whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. The words, "in whom" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "on whom now not looking, but believing"), are to be taken with the participles "seeing" and "believing," not with "ye rejoice." St. Peter insists on the necessity and blessedness of faith as earnestly as St. Paul does, though with him the antithesis is rather between faith and sight than between faith and works. As a tact, St. Peter's readers had never seen the Lord; now, though not seeing him with the outward eye, they realized his presence by faith, and in that presence they rejoiced. The verb is that used in ver. 6 - they rejoiced greatly, they exulted, and that though they saw him not. Human love needs the seen presence of the beloved one to complete the fullness of its joy (2 John 12); but their joy was even amid afflictions unspeakable - like all our deepest and holiest feelings, not to be expressed in words; and it was glorified by the unseen presence of Christ. His chosen behold even now, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, and, beholding, are changed into the same image from glory to glory. Joy in the Lord is a foretaste of the joy of heaven, and is irradiated by glimpses of the glory that shall be revealed. Others, as Huther and Alford, again give to the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye rejoice," a quasi-future sense. The word for "unspeakable" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is found only here.

Salvation is present as well as future.

God's elect receive it in various measures now; in its blessed fullness it will be manifested hereafter. It is the end which faith ever holds in view, pressing towards it as the prize of the high calling. It is the salvation especially of souls; for, as Bengel says," Anima praecipue salvatur; corpus in resurreetione participat."

There is no article, and the verbs are aorist. St. Peter illustrates the glory and greatness of our salvation (mark how he loves to repeat the word) by showing that it was the subject of the searching study of prophets and of the contemplation of angels. St. Peter was a diligent student of the prophetic books, and constantly quotes them, both in his Epistles and in his speeches recorded in the Acts. Here he gives us a very remarkable glimpse into the conditions of the prophetic consciousness. The scheme of our salvation was in some way revealed to the prophets; the mode of the revelation, whether by vision or otherwise, is not made known to us. Every point of contact between the infinite and the finite is enveloped in mystery; we can only know the fact - there was such a revelation. That salvation was so magnificent a prospect that it concentrated upon itself the rapt attention and deepest interest of those to whom the promise was revealed. Prophets inquired and searched diligently. The revelation was real, but it was not complete, not distinct in its details. God revealed so much of the coming salvation as was sufficient to support his servants in their trials, and to quicken their faith in the Messiah. Prophets searched diligently, as miners seeking treasure; they prayed, and thought, and meditated, and exercised all their intellectual energies in the effort to comprehend the revelation which had been vouchsafed to them. Daniel was a remarkable example of this searching (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-2.htm">Daniel 9:2, 3</a>). The revelation came to the prophet from God; the prophet received it, but could not comprehend it in all its depth and height - he searched diligently. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thoughts beyond their thoughts<br />To those high bards were given."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Christian Year.'</span>) (Compare the song of Zacharias, <a href="../../par/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68-79</a>.) Who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you? He defines the prophets, of whom he speaks as those who prophesied of the favor of God manifested in the redemption of mankind through his blessed Son. "Grace and truth came by Jesus Christ" (<a href="../../par/john/1-17.htm">John 1:17</a>). St. Paul loved to dwell on the grace of God; so did St. Peter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify; or, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">did point unto</span>. The Authorized Version neglects the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle says that the Spirit of Christ dwelt in the prophets. The words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> cannot mean "the Spirit which bears witness of Christ," as Bengel and others. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ (see <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). He is not only sent from the Father by the Son, but he proceedeth from the Father and the Son. This important statement involves also the pre-existence and the Divinity of Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56, 58</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-5.htm">Jude 1:5</a>, in the best-supported reading). The prophets felt within them the working of the Spirit. They knew that the mysterious voice which filled their souls was his voice. Its utterances were not always clear; they were sometimes obscure and mystical, but the heart of the prophets was stirred to the utmost; they sought with earnest prayer and devout thought into the purposes of God announced in the revelation. Especially they asked, as the apostles asked the Lord on the Mount of Olives, "When shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of thy coming?" At what time would the Messiah be revealed? What would be the distinctive character, the marks, the signs, of that time? "Prophetae ab ipso habentes donum in ilium prophetarunt" ('Ep. Barnab.,' 100. 5). When it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow; rather, <span class="accented">the sufferings for Christ</span> (destined for Christ), <span class="accented">and the glories after these</span>. Compare St. Peter's speech (<a href="../../par/acts/3-18.htm">Acts 3:18</a>), "Those things which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled." So St. Paul, in his speech before King Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/26-22.htm">Acts 26:22, 23</a>), asserts that he had said "none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead." The doctrine of a suffering Messiah was a stumbling-block to the Jews. The apostles could not understand it till after the Savior's resurrection; Peter himself had recoiled from it with horror, and had been rebuked by the Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22, 23</a>); now, taught by the Spirit, he understands the foreshadowings of the sufferings of Christ, which the Spirit of Christ had testified to the prophets. The Lord himself had expounded, on the day of his resurrection, the things concerning himself, beginning at Moses and all the prophets: "Ought not Christ," he said, "to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>). Some think that St. Peter is referring mainly to the prophets of the New Testament, and that the words, "the sufferings of Christ," are to be understood mystically of Christ suffering in his Church, as "the afflictions of Christ" in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. But the context does not require this explanation, and the parallel passages quoted above seem to preclude it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things.</span> It was revealed to them, whether in answer to their search as in the case of Daniel, or as part of the original revelation made to them, that the vision was for many days (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>). Compare St. Peter's quotations from the prophetic Scriptures in <a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>. The best manuscripts read here, "unto you." The prophets, doubtless, like Abraham, rejoiced to see the day of Christ; they saw it by faith, and were glad (<a href="../../par/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>); but they saw it in the far distance; they desired to see and hear what the apostles saw and heard, but the time was not yet (see <a href="../../par/matthew/13-16.htm">Matthew 13:16, 17</a>). <span class="accented">They did minister the things</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they were made the instruments of revealing them; they presented them to the devout for their spiritual food and support.

St. Peter claims for those who evangelized Asia Minor (St. Paul and his companions) the same authority which was possessed by the ancient prophets; they preached as fulfilled the great truths which the prophets foretold as future. The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets; the same Spirit worked and preached through the apostles; nay, he dwelt in them in fuller measure, for he had been sent down from heaven on the great Day of Pentecost, and it was by his aid that the apostles and evangelists preached. Which things the angels desire to look into. The salvation which God's elect receive is so full of glory and mysterious beauty, that not only did the prophets of old search diligently, but even an gels (there is no article) desire to look into it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means "to stoop sideways;" it is used of persons standing outside a place who stoop in order to look in. "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of the verb," says Huther, "indicates that the angels stand outside the work of redemption, inasmuch as it is not for them, but for man (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>)." The same verb occurs in <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-5.htm">John 20:5, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-12.htm">Luke 24:12</a>, in which last place it is used of Peter himself, when he stooped to look into the empty sepulcher on the morning of the Lord's resurrection. St. Paul has a similar thought in <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold wisdom of God." The attitude of the golden cherubim, whose wings covered the mercy-seat and whose faces were toward it (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>), seems to imply the same rapt, reverent attention.

St. Peter sums up in the word "wherefore" all the blessings, privileges, and hopes which he has enumerated; on these he founds his exhortations. <span class="accented">Gird up</span>.

But the same metaphor, expressed in similar words, is common. St. Peter alludes, doubtless, to the Lord's exhortation, "Let your loins be girded about;" perhaps also the solemn words of <a href="../../par/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18</a>, "signifying by what death he should glorify God," were present to his thoughts. <span class="accented">The loins of your mind</span>.

Be sober. The Christian must be sober in his use of the gifts of God; he must be sober also in his habits of thought; he should preserve a calm, collected temper.

The Christian's hope must be directed to, set towards (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> with accusative), the continual growth in grace ("He giveth more grace," <a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). That grace is being brought now, being borne in upon the soul in the present revelation of Jesus Christ. "It pleased God," says St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "to reveal his Son in me." So now the Lord manifests himself to those who walk in the path of loving obedience. Each gift of grace kindles the hope of a nearer manifestation, a fuller revelation; grace is continually brought, till at length the full unspeakable gift of grace is realized at the glorious revelation of Jesus Christ at his second advent. This seems better than to give the present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> a future sense, and to understand the revelation of Jesus Christ only of his final coming in glory.

The word "ignorance" is to be taken closely with "lusts" - "the former lusts which were in the time of your ignorance." It seems to imply that St. Peter is addressing Gentiles as well as Jews; top, though ignorance is attributed to the Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), it was ignorance, not of the moral law, as here, but of the Person and office of Christ.

"If" does not imply doubt; it introduces an hypothesis which, being taken for granted, involves a duty. Apparently there is here a reference to the Lord's Prayer, as in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>. You call on God as your Father; then pass your time in fear (comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>, "If I be a Father, where is mine honor?"). He called you first; now ye call on him. The translation of the Revised Version is more exact than the Authorized Version, "If ye call on him as Father."

The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "without respect of persons," occurs nowhere else in the New Testament; but the thought is familiar. St. Peter himself had said, when he was sent to receive Cornelius into the Church, "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons" (<a href="../../par/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>). The disciples of the Pharisees had said the same of our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>). The Lord said (<a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>), "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son." But the Father is "Fens judicii," as Didymus says (quoted by Alford), "judicante Filio, Pater est qu;. judicat," for the Son judges as his Delegate; as it was through the Son that the Father made the worlds. He judges according to every man's work, regarding, not distinctions of rank, or wealth, or nationality, but only the character of the work. Observe that the word "work" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is in the singular number, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. God judges according to every man's work as a whole, according to the whole scope and meaning of his life as issuing from the one governing principle, whether faith or selfishness. So Bengel, "Unius hominis unum est opus, bouum malumve." Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear. The verb here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, corresponds with the noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> ("conversation") of ver. 15; both might be rendered (as Dean Plumptre suggests) by "conduct" (noun or verb) - "in all your conduct" in ver. 15; and here, "conduct yourselves." The word "sojourning" reminds us of ver. 1 of this chapter and of <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, in which last place we have the corresponding Greek word. We are sojourners here, life is short; but the character of that short life determines our eternal condition; therefore live in fear. St. John says, "Perfect love casteth out fear;" but there is no contradiction, as some have said, between the two holy apostles; for the fear which cannot coexist with perfect love (it may in various measures coexist with imperfect love) is slavish fear, selfish fear of death and punishment. The fear which St. Peter and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>) commend is holy fear - the fear of a son for a loving father, the fear of displeasing God before whom we walk, God who gave his blessed Son to die for us, God who will judge us at the last. This fear is not cowardice. Our Lord said (<a href="../../par/luke/12-4.htm">Luke 12:4</a>), "Be not afraid of them that kill the body....  Fear him," etc. They who fear God need fear nothing else but God.

Doubtless no human language can adequately express the mystery of the atonement. That stupendous fact transcends human reason, and cannot be exactly defined in human words. But the Lord himself describes it as a ransom" a ransom for many," given in their stead. Reverence keeps us from pressing the illustration in all its details. It may be that the correspondence between the atonement and the redemption of a slave from an earthly master is not exact in all points. But the illustration comes from the Lord himself, who is the Truth; it must be true as far as human language permits, as far as human reason can comprehend. It teaches, as plainly as words can express, the doctrine of vicarious satisfaction: he gave his life, not only in behalf of us, but also instead of us - a ransom for our sins.

St. Peter seems to be thinking mainly of Gentile Christians; he would scarcely describe the sinful conversation of Israelites as "handed down from your fathers" (Revised Version) without some qualification. Habits are transmitted from fathers to children; habitual custom is made an excuse for many shortcomings, but "unus Pater imitandus" (Bengel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot</span>, (<span class="accented">even the blood</span>) <span class="accented">of Christ</span>. <span class="accented">Precious</span>, as opposed to the "corruptible things" of ver. 18; it is precious, because it is the blood of Christ. Christ's holy body saw not corruption; gold and silver must perish at last; the precious blood in its virtue and efficacy abideth evermore. The blood of Christ is compared with that of a lamb. The lambs and other animals offered as sacrifices were to be without blemish (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19, 20, 21</a>); Christ was without sin, pure, harmless, undefiled. The blood of animals could never take away sin; yet it is written, "The life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh atonement for the soul" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). That blood prefigured the precious blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all sin. The sacrifices of the Law directed the faith of the pious Israelite to the one great Sacrifice, the Propitiation for the sins of the whole world. Probably St. Peter derived the comparison from the well-remembered words of the Baptist, reported by his brother Andrew, "Behold the Lamb of God!" The reference may be to the Paschal lamb ("Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us," <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>) - the blood of that lamb cannot, indeed, be regarded as a ransom from Egyptian bondage, but it saved the Israelites from the destroying angel - or to any sacrificial lamb. The apostle seems to be passing from the idea of ransom or price to that of expiation. The verb "ye were redeemed," the silver and gold, direct the thoughts to price; the blood and the lamb, to expiation. The two ideas are closely connected; the two illustrations combined give a fuller view of the blessed meaning of the Savior's death than either of them alone could do.

But the foreknowledge of God implies the exercise of his will, therefore the "foreordained" of the Authorized Version, though not here an exact translation, is true in doctrine. St. Peter had asserted the same great truth in his sermon on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; comp. also Acts 3:18 and Acts 4:28). He had heard the words, "before the foundation of the world," again and again from the lips of Christ; he may possibly have read them in the Epistle to the Ephesians (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). The incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ were not the result of a change of purpose to meet unforeseen circumstances; they were foreseen and foreordained in the eternal counsels of God.

The thought shows the greatness of God's love for his elect. The eternal Son was manifested for their sake; it gives an additional stimulus for Christian effort. That <span class="accented">raised</span> him up from the dead, and gave him glory. St. Peter returns to the "after-glories," which he had mentioned in ver. 11. The death of Christ is the atonement for sin; his resurrection and ascension are the grounds of our confidence and hope. They throw back a halo of Divine glory upon the awful cross; they bring out the beauty and the dignity of the atoning sacrifice; they show that it is accepted, that the work of our redemption is complete. The Resurrection held a very prominent place in the preaching of St. Peter, and, indeed, of all the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32-36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-15.htm">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-10.htm">Acts 4:10</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, etc.).

The resurrection and the glory of Christ not only inspire the Christian with confidence in God, but they also give his faith the character of hope; they fill it with hope. Christ had promised that where he is there should his servant be; he had prayed that those whom the Father had given him should be with him where he is, to behold his glory. He is in heaven, on the right hand of God. Thus the Christian's faith assumes the attitude of hope; he hopes to be where Christ is, to see him as he is, to be made like unto him. This is "the hope of glory" for which we offer our thanksgivings. St. Peter is the apostle of hope.

In this sense it implies consecration to God's service, and an inward cleansing of the heart from all that defiles - from sensual desires, from hypocrisy, from selfishness.

Our hearts must be purified in the obedience of the truth before that unfeigned love can dwell in them (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>, which is an exact parallel). See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently; literally, <span class="accented">love one another from the heart</span>. The word "pure" is omitted in two of the most ancient manuscripts; it may be a gloss, but it is most true and suitable. Christian love must he from the heart, true and pure. The word rendered "fervently" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) means, literally, "intensely," with all the energies strained to the utmost. It is interesting to observe that the only other place where the adverb occurs is in <a href="../../par/acts/12-5.htm">Acts 12:5</a> (according to the reading of the most ancient manuscripts), where it is used of the prayer offered up for St. Peter himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a></div><div class="verse">Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Being born again</span>; rather, <span class="accented">having been begotten again</span>. St. Peter repeats the verb used already in ver. 3. It is the highest argument for brotherly love; the children of the one Father are all brethren; they should "love as brethren" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>). Not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth forever. The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) means, properly, "sowing;" but, like <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/luke/8-11.htm">Luke 8:11</a>), it stands also for the seed; and here the epithets "corruptible" and "incorruptible" seem to necessitate this second meaning. In the passage quoted from St. Luke, the seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is identified with the Word. "The seed is the Word of God." Here there seems to be a distinction. God's elect are begotten again of incorruptible seed through the  Word. The use of different prepositions, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> apparently implies a difference between the seed and the Word. In the conversation with Nicodemus the Lord had said, "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." And he continues, "That which is born of the flesh [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to correspond with the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of St. Peter] is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit;" where the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "that which is begotten of the Spirit," correspond very nearly with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "those who are begotten again of incorruptible seed." Then the incorruptible seed is the Holy Spirit of God, the Source of all spiritual life; it is the Spirit that "beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God;" "To be spiritually minded is life." Comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>, "Whosoever is born of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) cloth not commit sin: for his seed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) abideth in him: and he cannot sin because he is born of God"). There is a different explanation of this last passage: "God's seed, that is, his children, abide in him." But on the whole, it seems to be parallel with this verse, and to teach the same doctrine, that the first gift of the Spirit is the germ of spiritual life, and that that precious germ, abiding in the true children of God, lives and energizes "till we come... unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>). But if the Holy Spirit of God is, in the deepest sense, the Seed of the new birth, the Word is the instrument. God's elect are begotten again <span class="accented">through</span> the Word, the Word preached, heard, read, pronounced in holy baptism. The Word preached by St. Peter on the great Day of Pentecost was the means by which three thousand souls were led to be baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost (comp. <a href="../../par/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>, "Of his own will begat he us with the Word of truth"). Again, the Word preached derives its power from the personal Word, from him who is the Word of God. "All things were made through him" (John L 3; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>); and as the first creation was through him, so is the new creation. He is "the Beginning of the creation of God" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>); for he is our Life, the life hidden in the heart. He is the Word of life: "He that hath the Son hath life" (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-12.htm">1 John 5:12</a>); "Through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>). It is through the Lord Jesus Christ that we receive the grace of the new birth. The words, "which liveth and abideth," may be connected with the Divine Name: "God, who liveth and abideth; "or, as in our version, with "the Word." The last connection seems most suitable here (comp. ver. 25, "The Word of the Lord abideth for ever;" and <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, "The Word of God is quick and powerful'). The most ancient manuscripts omit the words, "forever."

St. Peter quotes <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, in illustration of his assertion that the Word of God abideth forever. The quotation is from the Septuagint. St. Peter follows that version in omitting part of ver. 7; but he slightly varies the words, writing (according to the most ancient manuscripts), "all the glory thereof," instead of "all the glory of man;" and in the next verse, "the Word of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>," instead of "the Word of our God." The first variation shows an acquaintance with the original Hebrew. St. James refers to the same passage from Isaiah in <a href="../../par/james/1-10.htm">James 1:10, 11</a>.

Compare the transition from <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in St. Peter's speech recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36, 37</a>. The Revised Version renders the last half of the verse, <span class="accented">And this is the Word of good tidings which was preached unto you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">This is the Word which was preached as good tidings</span>. Here St. Peter recognizes the gospel which had been preached in Asia Minor as the Word of the Lord which abideth for ever. St. Paul and his companions were the missionaries from whom those provinces had heard the Word of God.

The paraphrase of the Authorized Version gives the general meaning; but the adjective means literally, "reasonable" or "rational." The apostle is not thinking of natural milk, but of that nourishment which the Christian reason can regard as milk for the soul - spiritual food, pure and simple and nourishing, capable of supporting and strengthening those newborn babes who not long ago had been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the Word of God. The adjective occurs only in one other place of Holy Scripture (possibly St. Peter may have read it there) - <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, where it means the service of the sanctified reason as opposed to the mechanical observance of formal rites.

The "if" does not imply doubt; the apostle supposes that they have once tasted, and urges them, on the ground of that first taste, to long for more. The first experiences of the Christian life stimulate God's people to further efforts. The words are a quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, "Oh taste and see that the Lord is good!" This makes it less probable that St. Peter is intentionally playing, as some have thought, on the similarity of the words <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.

But St. Peter is simply quoting the words of the psalm, and applying them to the metaphor of milk. It is possible that there may be an under-current of allusion to the Lord's teaching in <a href="../../par/john/6.htm">John 6</a>. The Lord himself is the Bread of life, the food of the soul. The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is not infrequently used of food (see <a href="../../par/luke/5-39.htm">Luke 5:39</a>).

The ', living Stone" is Christ; the "Lord" of <a href="../../par/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a> is Jehovah. St. Peter passes from the figure of milk to that of a chief cornerstone. So St. Paul, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>, after saying that he had fed his Corinthian converts "with milk, and not with meat," passes first to the figure of laborers on the land, and then to that of builders upon the one foundation "which is Jesus Christ." This, like so many other coincidences, indicates St. Peter's knowledge of St. Paul's Epistles. St. Peter may have been thinking of his own name, the name which Christ gave him when Andrew brought him to the Lord; though the Greek word here is not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;</span> the solid native rock on which the temple is built, nor a piece of rock, an unhewn stone, but a stone shaped and wrought, chosen for a chief corner-stone. But the apostle does not mention himself; he omits all reference to his own position in the spiritual building; he wishes to direct his readers only to Christ. He is plainly referring to the Lord's own words in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, where Christ applies to himself the language of <a href="../../par/psalms/118.htm">Psalm 118</a>, He described himself as a Stone; St. Peter adds the epithet "<span class="accented">living"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). The figure of a stone is inadequate, all figures are inadequate, to represent heavenly mysteries. This stone is not, like the stones of earth, an inert mass; it is living, full of life; nay, it gives life, as well as strength and coherence, to the stones which are built upon it: for the Lord hath life in himself - he is risen from the dead, and is alive for evermore. <span class="cmt_word">Disallowed indeed of men.</span> St. Peter slightly varies the quotation, and attributes to men in general the rejection ascribed in the psalm and in the Gospel to the "<span class="accented">builders</span>." "<span class="accented">He</span> was despised and rejected of men." In his speech before the Sanhedrin (<a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>), he had directly applied the prophecy to the chief priests. But chosen of God, and precious; rather, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">with God elect, precious</span>, or perhaps better, <span class="accented">honored</span>; a reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>. He was rejected of the builders, but chosen of God; despised of men, but with God held in honor. The adjective is not the same as that rendered "precious" in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>: <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> there marks the preciousness of the blood of Christ in itself; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here, the honor with which God "hath highly exalted him." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also, as lively stones</span>; rather, <span class="accented">living stones</span>. The word is the same as that used in ver. 4. Christians are living stones in virtue of their union with the one living Stone: "Because I live, ye shall live also." <span class="cmt_word">Are built up a spiritual house</span>; rather, <span class="accented">be ye built up</span>. The imperative rendering seems more suitable than the indicative, and the passive than the middle. The Christian comes; God builds him up on the one Foundation. The apostle says," Come to be built up; come that ye may be built up." The parallel passage in <a href="../../par/jude/1-20.htm">Jude 1:20</a>, "But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith," might seem to point to a reflexive rendering here; but the verb used by St. Jude is active, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Jude is apparently thinking of the human side of the work, St. Peter of the Divine; in the deepest sense Christ is the Builder as well as the Foundation, as he himself said in words doubtless present to St. Peter's mind, "Upon this rock I will build my Church." That Church is the antitype of the ancient temple - a building not material, but spiritual, consisting, not of dead stones, but of sanctified souls, resting on no earthly foundation, but on that Rock which is Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An holy priesthood</span>; rather, for (literally, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented">a holy priesthood</span>. The figure again changes; the thought of the temple leads to that of the priesthood. The stones in the spiritual temple are <span class="accented">living</span> stones; they are also priests. According to the original ideal of the Hebrew theocracy, all Israelites were to be priests: "Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, a holy nation" (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This ideal is fulfilled in the Christian Church; it is a holy priesthood. Here and in ver. 9 the Church collectively is called a priesthood; in the Book of the Revelation (Revelation 1:6; 5:10; 20:6) Christians individually are called priests, Bishop Lightfoot says, at the opening of his dissertation on the Christian ministry, "The kingdom of Christ has no sacred days or seasons, no special sanctuaries, because every time and every place alike are holy. Above all, it has no sacerdotal system. It interposes no sacrificial tribe or class between God and man." He continues, "This conception is strictly an ideal, which we must ever hold before our eyes...  but which nevertheless cannot supersede the necessary wants of human society, and, if crudely and hastily applied, will lead only to signal failure. As appointed days and set places are indispensable to her efficiency, so also the Church could not fulfill the purposes for which she exists without rulers and teachers, without a ministry of reconciliation, in short, without an order of men who may in some sense be designated a priesthood." The whole Jewish Church was a kingdom of priests; yet there was an Aaronic priesthood. The Christian Church is a holy priesthood; yet there is an order of men who are appointed to exercise the functions of the ministry, and who, as representing the collective priesthood of the whole Church, may be truly called priests. <span class="cmt_word">To offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</span> The priest must have somewhat to offer (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>). The sacrifices of the ancient Law had found their fulfillment in the one all-sufficient Sacrifice, offered once for all by the great High Priest upon the altar of the cross. But there is still sacrifice in the Christian Church. That one Sacrifice is ever present in its atoning virtue and cleansing power; and through that one Sacrifice the priests of the spiritual temple offer up daily spiritual sacrifices - the sacrifice of prayer and praise (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>), the sacrifice of alms and oblations (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>), and that sacrifice without which prayer and praise and alms are vain oblations, the sacrifice of self (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). These spiritual sacrifices are offered up through Jesus Christ the great High Priest (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>); they derive their value only from faith in his sacrifice of himself; they are efficacious through his perpetual mediation and intercession; through him alone they are acceptable to God. They are offered through him, and they are acceptable through him. The Greek words admit of either connection; and perhaps are intended to cover both relations.

Compare the use of the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> in <a href="../../par/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a>. St. Peter proceeds to quote the prophecy (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>) to which he has already referred. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone, elect, precious.</span> The passage is taken from the Septuagint, with the emission of some words not important for the present purpose. St. Paul quotes the same prophecy still more freely (<a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). The rabbinical writers understand it of Hezekiah, but the earlier Jewish interpreters regarded it as Messianic. <span class="cmt_word">And he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</span> The Hebrew words literally mean "shall not be in haste;" the Septuagint appears to give the general meaning. He that believeth (the Hebrew word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, means "to lean upon, to build upon," and so "to trust, to confide") shall not be flurried and excited with vain fears and trepidation; his mind is stayed on the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">Unto you therefore which believe <i>he is</i> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto you therefore which believe he is precious</span>; rather, <span class="accented">unto you therefore which believe is the honor</span>. The apostle applies the last clause of the prophecy to his readers: they believe, they are built up by faith upon the chief Cornerstone; therefore the honor implied in the words of the prophet, "He that believeth on him shall not be confounded" is theirs. There may also be in the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, honor, an echo of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("precious," literally, "held in honor") of ver. 6; and thus the further meaning may be implied, "The worth which the stone has it has for you who believe" (Wiesinger, quoted by Huther). But the first explanation is nearer to the Greek. <span class="cmt_word">But unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the Head of the corner</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">for such as disbelieve</span>. St. Peter repeats the words of the hundred and eighteenth psalm, quoted by our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>, and by himself in <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>. The builders, the priests and teachers of the Jewish Church, rejected the living Stone; but it became, and indeed through that rejection, the Head of the corner. "He became obedient unto death ... therefore God also highly exalted him." If this psalm is post-Exilic, as most modern critics think, the cornerstone, in its first application, may be Israel regarded as a whole. The great builders, the rulers of Assyria, Babylon, Persia, had despised that stone; but it was chosen of God, and now it was set in Zion. It is possible, as Hengstenberg and Delitzsch suggest, that the building of the second temple may have recalled to the mind of the psalmist Isaiah's prophecy of the chief Corner-stone. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <i>even to them</i> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense</span>. St. Peter combines <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a> with his first quotations, as St. Paul also does (Ram. 9:33), both apostles quoting from the Hebrew, not from the Septuagint, which is quite different, inserting two negatives. The living Stone is not only made the Head of the corner to the confusion of the disobedient, but becomes also to their destruction a Stone of stumbling; they fall on that Stone, and are broken (<a href="../../par/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>). That Stone is a Rock (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), the Rock of Ages, the Rock on which the Church is built; but to the disobedient it is a Rock of offense (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">in Attic Greek</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is properly the catch or spring of a trap, which makes animals fall into the trap; then a stumbling-block - anything which causes men to fall. We cannot fail to notice how St. Peter echoes the well-remembered words of our Lord, recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18, 23</a>. Peter was himself then a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, a rock of offense. Even to them <span class="cmt_word">which stumble at the Word, being disobedient</span>; literally, <span class="accented">who being disobedient stumble at the Word - the</span> relative referring back to "them which be disobedient" in ver. 7. This seems better than (with Huther and others) to take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "who stumble, being disobedient to the Word." <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, literally," unbelieving," contains here, as frequently, the idea of disobedience, willful opposition. St. Peter seems to come very near to St. John's use of <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> for the personal Word, the Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto also they were appointed</span>. "Whereunto" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;</span>) cannot refer back to ver. 5; God had appointed them to be built up in his spiritual house, but they were disobedient. It must refer either to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> - sin is punished by sin; for sin in God's awful judgment hardens the heart; the disobedient are in danger of eternal sin (<a href="../../par/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>, according to the two oldest manuscripts) - or, more probably, to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; it is God's ordinance that disobedience should end in stumbling; but that stumbling does not necessarily imply condemnation (see <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). The word, the preaching of Christ crucified, was to the Jews a stumbling-block (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). But not all stumbled that they might fall. Nevertheless, perseverance in disobedience must end in everlasting death.

The pronoun "ye" is emphatic. St. Peter is drawing a contrast between the disobedient and unbelieving Jews and Christian people whether Jews or Gentiles; he ascribes to Christians, in a series of phrases quoted from the Old Testament, the various privileges which had belonged to the children of Israel. The words, "a chosen generation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>), are from <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-20.htm">Isaiah 43:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>.

The whole Christian Church is addressed as an elect race, one race, because all its members are begotten again of the one Father. <span class="cmt_word">A royal priesthood</span>. Instead of "holy," as in ver. 5, St. Peter has here the epithet "royal." He follows the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; the Hebrew has "a kingdom of priests." The word "royal" may mean that God's elect shall sit with Christ in his throne, and reign with him (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>), and that in some sense they reign with him now over their lower nature, their desires and appetites; or, more probably, the priesthood of Christians is called "royal" because it belongs to the King - "a priesthood serving Jehovah the King, just as we speak of 'the royal household'" (Weiss, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">An holy nation.</span> Also from <a href="../../par/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>.

The literal meaning of the Greek words used by St. Peter is "a people for acquisition," or "for keeping safe," the verb having the sense of "gaining, acquiring," and also that of "preserving, keeping for one's self" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>; also <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "The Church of God, which he purchased (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) with his own blood"). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should show forth the praises of him.</span> That ye should tell out, publish abroad.

The word here rendered "<span class="accented">strangers"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is equivalent to the classical <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and means "foreign set-tiers, dwellers in a strange land." The second word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, translated "strangers" in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.) means "visitors" who tarry for a time in a foreign country, not permanently settling in it. It does not contain the ideas associated with the modern use of "<span class="accented">pilgrim</span>;" though that word, derived kern the <span class="accented">Latin peregrinus</span>, originally meant no more than "sojourner." St. Peter is plainly using the words metaphorically his readers were citizens of the heavenly country; on earth they were sojourners. Both words occur in the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/psalms/39-12.htm">Psalm 39:12</a> (38:13 in the Greek), with the same metaphorical meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</span> Strangers and pilgrims should remember their distant home, and not follow the practices of the strange land in which they sojourn. The lusts of the flesh are all those desires which issue out of our corrupt nature (temp. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-21</a>).

"<span class="accented">Non</span> mode impediunt," says Bengel, "sod oppugnant; grande verbum" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>). St. Peter uses the word "<span class="accented">soul"</span> here for the whole spiritual nature of man, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-9.htm">1 Peter 1:9, 22</a>.

The Churches to which St. Peter wrote were in Gentile countries; they must be careful, for the honor of their religion, to set a good example among the heathen - a warning, alas! too often neglected in modern as well as in ancient times. <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak against you as evil-doers</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wherein</span>, in the matter in which they speak, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in reference to manner of life.

Suetonius calls them a "genus hominum superstitionis novae et maleficse" ('Vit. Neron.,' 1 Peter 16.). Probably the grosser accusations of Thyestean banquets, etc., came later. <span class="cmt_word">They may by your good works, which they shall be hold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> The word rendered, "which they shall be bold" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, or, according to some of the older manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, beholding), occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-2.htm">1 Peter 3:2</a>. It implies close attention; the Gentiles watched the conduct of the Christians, narrowly scrutinizing it to discover faults and inconsistencies. The use of the corresponding substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a> is a coincidence to be noticed. It is not probable that there is any reference to the heathen use of the word in connection with the Eleusinian Mysteries. St. Peter hopes that this close observation of the lives of Christian people would lead the Gentiles to glorify God; he was thinking, perhaps, of our Lord's words in the sermon on the mount: "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.' Perhaps in the following clause also we may trace an echo of the Savior's words in <a href="../../par/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>, "<span class="accented">Because</span> thou knewest not the time of thy visitation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, as here). St. Peter hopes that the holy lives of Christians may be made the means of saving many Gentile souls in the time of visitation; that is, when God should visit the heathen with his converting grace, seeking to draw them to himself, whether by gracious chastisement or by the preaching of his servants. This seems more natural than to understand the words of God's visitation of the Christians in the persecutions which were impending; though it is true that many Gentiles were won to Christ by the calm and holy bearing of suffering Christians.

The word for "ordinance" is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which in classical Greek means "foundation," as of a city; but in the New Testament is used elsewhere only of the works of God, in the sense of "creation," or "a creature" (see <a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, etc.). Hence some, as De Wette, translate the words, "to every human creature," supporting their view by <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>.

Certainly "there is no power but of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>); but the form which that power assumes is a human institution. St. Peter bids his readers to submit themselves to the <span class="accented">de facto</span> form of government. <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord's sake.</span> Not from human motives, as fear of punishment; but for the Lord's sake, because "the powers that be are ordained of God," and in obeying them we obey the ordinance of God. Christians were commonly accused of insubordination, of doing "contrary to the decrees of Caesar" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>); they must show by their conduct that these accusations are false, that the progress of the gospel be not hindered. <span class="cmt_word">Whether it be to the king, as supreme</span>. By "the king" is meant the Roman emperor, who was frequently so described in the Greek writers. Nero was emperor when St. Peter wrote. Christians were to obey even him, wicked tyrant as he was; for his power was given him from above, as the Lord himself had said of Pilate (<a href="../../par/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>).

Some commentators, following Calvin, understand the pronoun of the Lord. Certainly, governors are sent through him; he "ordereth all things, both in heaven and earth." But it seems more natural in this place to refer the pronoun to the nearer substantive, the king; it was through the Roman emperor that the various governors, legates, etc., were sent from time to time (as the Greek present participle implies) to administer the provinces. <span class="cmt_word">For the punish-meat of evil-doers, and for the praise of them that do well.</span> Observe the close resemblance to <a href="../../par/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3, 4</a>. St. Peter recognizes the Roman sense of justice which we see in men like Festus and Gallio. At first the Jews were the persecutors of the Christians; the Roman magistrates were their protectors. St. Peter wrote before the great outbreaks of Roman persecution; he was himself to suffer under that emperor whose authority he upheld.

The Greek word rendered "put to silence" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) means literally "to muzzle" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/22-12.htm">Matthew 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Honour all <i>men</i>. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Honor all men.</span> St. Peter illustrates the well-doing which he enjoins in ver. 15, drawing out his general exhortation into four rules of conduct. First, he bids us give honor to all men. The Christians of Asia Minor saw heathenism and vice all around them; they heard of the abominable life of Nero and his courtiers at Rome. They were conscious of a great and elevating change which had passed over themselves; St. Peter has just been enumerating the dignities and privileges of the Christian life. But they must not be lifted up; they must despise no one, but honor in all men the handiwork of God, created after God's own image, though sadly marred and defaced by sin. Respect is due to all men, of course in varying degrees and to be shown in different ways; but in some sense it is due to all, to the humblest and even to the worst. The aorist imperative (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) seems to lay down this principle as a sharp, definite rule, to be accepted at once, and to be applied as need arises, according to the circumstances of each case. The three following imperatives are present; the duties which they prescribe are viewed as continuous, recognized elements in well-doing. There was something new and strange in the command to honor all men; it is expressed forcibly, once for all, by the aorist imperative. <span class="cmt_word">Love the brotherhood</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, brotherhood, is peculiar to St. Peter; it stands for the aggregate of Christian brethren regarded as one body in Christ. The Lord bids us "love our enemies." St. Peter's rule does not weaken the force of the Savior's precept. But love must vary in depth and degree according to the varying relations of life; and the love which true Christians feel for the like-minded must be one of its strongest forms. <span class="cmt_word">Fear God. Honor the king.</span> The holy fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God as the King of kings will lead us to give due honor to earthly princes, who rule by his controlling providence. It was especially necessary to urge the fear of God as a motive, when the king to be honored was such as Nero. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">Servants, <i>be</i> subject to <i>your</i> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Servants</span>.

St. Peter may have used it as a less harsh term, in Christian kindliness and courtesy; or he may have chosen it purposely to include the large class of freedmen and other dependents who were to be found in the houses of the great. The frequent mention of slaves in the Epistles shows that many of the first Christians must have been in a condition of servitude (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). It was only natural that men should feel uneasy and irritable under the yoke of slavery as they came to learn the equality of all men in the sight of God, and to understand the blessed privileges and the high hopes of Christians. The apostles counseled submission and resignation to the will of God. Slavery was an unnatural institution; it must in time disappear under the softening influences of the gospel. But Christian slaves were to wait in faith and patience. The sacred writers use language of studied moderation, carefully avoiding any expressions which might be regarded as exciting to violence or revolutionary outbreaks. <span class="cmt_word">Be subject to your</span> <span class="cmt_word">masters with all fear</span>. The participle <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> seems to look back to the imperative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 13; the relation of slaves to their lords being one of the ordinances of man alluded to there (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>, where St. Paul bids slaves to be obedient to their masters "with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ"). The holy fear of God, by whose providence they were set in that lowly station, would involve the fear of failing in their duty to their masters. <span class="accented">All fear</span>; not only fear of punishment, but also fear of neglecting duty. <span class="cmt_word">Not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward</span>. Servants must not make the character of their masters an excuse for disobedience; if their masters are froward (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, literally, "crooked, perverse"), still they must be submissive to the wilt of God.

It is probably used literally here; blows were a common occurrence in the life of slaves. To be patient when suffering deserved punishment is often difficult, but it is no more than a simple duty; it would not be for the glory of religion. Christian slaves ought to do their duty to their masters, and not deserve punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it patiently</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but if doing well, and suffering</span>.

The Greek for "example" is <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> word which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means a copy set by a writing or drawing master, which was to be exactly reproduced by his pupils (see 2 Macc. 2:28, in the Greek). The life of Christ is our model. In particular St. Peter urges us to imitate the Lord's patience in suffering undeserved afflictions. In the last clause the figure is changed to that of a guide along a difficult route, so difficult that those who follow must put their feet in his footprints. We should follow his steps, one by one, closely following him, as the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> means (comp. <a href="../../par/mark/16-20.htm">Mark 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10, 24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</span> St. Peter is quoting the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, almost exactly, the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, sin, being substituted for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, lawlessness ("violence" in our version). We should notice that the Messiah, whose example is here set before Christian slaves, is called by the prophet "the Servant of Jehovah" (Isaiah lit. 13). Slaves were often tempted to deceit and guile; they must look to the Lord Jesus, and strive to copy his innocence and his truth. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be found, is sometimes said to be used, by a Hebraism, for the simple verb "to be." Winer says, "Between these two verbs, however, there is always this distinction, that, whilst <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, indicates the quality of a thing in itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> indicates the quality in so far as it is discovered, detected, recognized, in the subject" ('Greek Grammar,' 65:8). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <i>himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>). The Lord again and again denounced the hypocrisy and unbelief of the Pharisees; he bade Caiaphas remember the coming judgment. But that was the language of prophetic warning, the sternness of love. He sets before them the impending punishment, that they may take heed in time and escape from the wrath to come. In the midst of his strongest invective against the sins and hollow unreality of Pharisaism there is an outburst of the deepest love, the tenderest concern (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). But committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. The verb "committed" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) is without an object in the original. Most commentators supply "himself," or "his cause;" others, "his sufferings;" some, as Alford, "those who inflicted them." Perhaps the last explanation is the best: he left them to God, to God's mercy, if it might be; to his judgment, if it must be. There may be a reference to his prayer, "Father, forgive them." Compare by contrast the language of Jeremiah, speaking in the spirit of the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-20.htm">Jeremiah 11:20</a> and Jeremiah 20:12). There is a curious reading, entirely without the authority of existing Greek manuscripts, represented by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Tradebat judicanti se injuste</span>, as if the words were understood of the Lord's submitting himself "to one who judged unrighteously," that is, to Pilate. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a></div><div class="verse">Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who his own self, bare our sins in his own body on the tree.</span> St. Peter has thus far spoken of our Lord as our Example of patient endurance; but he seems to feel that, although this is the aspect of the Savior's sufferings most suitable to his present purpose, yet it is scarcely seemly to dwell upon that most momentous of all events, the death of Christ our Lord upon the cross, without mentioning its more solemn and awful import. A martyr may be an example of patient suffering; he cannot bear our sins. The apostle proceeds to unfold the contents of the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 21. The Lord <span class="accented">died for</span> us: but what is the meaning of the preposition? Was it that his example might stimulate us to imitate his patience and his holy courage? This is a <span class="accented">true</span> view, but, taken alone, it would be utterly inadequate. The death of the Son of God had a far deeper significance. The <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span> used here and elsewhere is explained by the more precise <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> of <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, in which last passage both propositions are combined. The Lord died, not only in our behalf, but in our stead. He gave "his life a ransom for many;" "he is the Propitiation for our sins." St. Peter exhibits here, with all possible emphasis, this vicarious aspect of the Savior's death. "He bore our sins <span class="accented">himself</span>." The pronoun is strongly emphatic; he bore them, though they were not his own. They were <span class="accented">our</span> sins, but <span class="accented">he</span> bore them - he alone; none other could bear that awful burden. <span class="accented">He bare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle is evidently quoting <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the Hebrew verb is ?and the Septuagint Version is <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>; comp. vers. 4 and 11 (in ver. 11 there is another Hebrew verb) of the same chapter. In the Old Testament "to bear <span class="accented">sins"</span> or "iniquity" means to suffer the punishment of sin, whether one's own sin or the sin of others (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1, 17</a>, and many similar passages). In the description of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement in <a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>. it is said (Ver. 22) that the scapegoat "shall bear upon him [the Hebrew is ; the Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>] all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited," where the scapegoat is represented as bearing the sins of the people and taking them away. Compare also the great saying of the Baptist, "Behold the Lamb of God. which taketh away the sin of the world!" where the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be rendered with equal exactness, "who beareth," or "who taketh away." The Lord took our sins away by taking them upon himself (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>). As Aaron put the sins of the people upon the head of the scapegoat (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>), and the goat was to bear them upon him unto a land not inhabited, so the Lord laid on the blessed Savior the iniquity of us all, and he bare our sins in his own body on to the tree, and, there dying in our stead, took them away. He bare them on himself, as the scapegoat bare upon him the iniquities of Israel. It was this burden of sin which made his sacred body sweat great drops of blood in his awful agony. He bare them on to the tree (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); he carried them thither, and there he expiated them (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>, "Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many," where the same Greek word is used - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>). Another interpretation takes <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in its sacrificial sense, as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, and regards the cross as the altar: "<span class="accented">He</span> bore our sins on to the altar of the cross." The Lord is both Priest and Victim, and the verb is used in the sacred writings both of the priest who offers the sacrifice and of the sacrifice which bears or takes away sin. But the sacrifice which the Lord offered up was himself, not our sins; therefore it seems best to understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> here rather of victim than of priest, as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a> and the Greek Version of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>. The thought of sacrifice was doubtless present to the apostle's mind, as it certainly was to the prophet's (see ver. 10 of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.). The word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is used for the cross twice in St. Peter's speeches in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/5-30.htm">Acts 5:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>). It is also so used by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness.</span> The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. Bengel understands it differently. He says that as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means "to become the slave of some one," so <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> may mean to cease to be a slave. But this would require the genitive, not the dative, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and the ordinary translation is more suitable to the following context. The word is several times used in Herodotus in the sense of "having died;" more literally, "having ceased to be." The tense (aorist) seems to point to a definite time, as the time of baptism (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>). Righteousness here is simply the opposite of sin - obedience, submission to the will of God. Bengel says, "Justitia tota una est; peccatum multiplex." <span class="cmt_word">By whose stripes ye were healed</span>. The apostle is quoting the Septuagint rendering of <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c8;</span> means the mark or weal left on the flesh by a scourge (comp. Ecclus. 28:17, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The slaves, whom the apostle is addressing, might perhaps not infrequently be subjected to the scourge; he bids them remember the more dreadful flagellation which the Lord endured. They were to learn patience of him, and to remember to their comfort that those stripes which he, the holy Son of God, condescended to suffer are to them that believe healing and salvation. Faith in the crucified Savior lifts the Christian out of the sickness of sin into the health of righteousness.

The apostle is probably still thinking of the great prophecy of Isaiah, and here almost reproduces the words of the sixth verse, "All we like sheep have gone astray." He who had been thrice charged to feed the sheep and the lambs of Christ would think also of the parable of the lost sheep, and of the people of Israel who were "as sheep having no shepherd" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls</span>; literally, <span class="accented">but ye returned</span> (the verb is aorist); that is, at the time of their conversion.

Christ is the Shepherd of our souls. The quotation from Isaiah doubtless brought before St. Peter's thoughts the sweet and holy allegory of the good Shepherd, which he had heard from the Savior's lips (comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; also <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>.). The word "bishop" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is used in a similar connection in <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, "Take heed...  to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" comp. also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, "I will both search my sheep, and seek them out," where the Greek word for "seek them out" is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>.

There must have been Christian masters in Asia Minor, as is plain from <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-1.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>. But we notice that St. Paul, though he has a few words for masters, addresses slaves at much greater length. Probably Christian masters were comparatively few, while large numbers of slaves had embraced the religion which could do so much to comfort and elevate the oppressed. Again, the immediate purpose of the apostle is to inculcate submission to authority; therefore, having enforced upon Christian servants the example of their Lord, he proceeds to speak of the duty of Christian wives. Christianity was in its infancy; it was to be the means of abolishing slavery, and of raising woman to her proper place in society; but as yet slaves were cruelly oppressed, and women were ill treated and despised. Aristotle tells us that among the barbarians (and a large proportion of the population in the greater part of Asia Minor was barbarian, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> non-Greek) the woman and the slave hold the same rank ('Pol.,' I. 2:4). In Greek communities the case was different; but even among the Greeks women occupied a very subordinate position. Christianity would introduce a great and sweeping change in the relations of the sexes, as well as in the relations of master and slave. But the change must be gradual, not violent; it must be brought about by the softening and purifying influences of religion, not by revolt against recognized customs and established authority. Indeed, Christianity would introduce an element of division - the Lord had said so (<a href="../../par/luke/12-51.htm">Luke 12:51-53</a>); families would be divided. It could not be otherwise; Christians must not set even family ties above the love of Christ. But Christian wives must be peacemakers; they must, as far as possible, live at peace even with unbelieving husbands. They would often have much ill treatment to endure in those coarse, cruel days; they must bear it with the quiet strength of gentleness. <span class="cmt_word">Be in subjection to your own husbands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">submitting yourselves.</span> The participle, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, seems to look back to the imperative, "submit yourselves," in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The present participle implies that this voluntary submission is to be habitual. The adjective "your own" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) emphasizes the duty. <span class="cmt_word">That, if any obey not the Word, they also may without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives</span>. There is a well-supported reading, "Even if any." Husband and wife would often be converted together; but if this should not be the case, and if the unbelieving husband should set himself in direct opposition to the Word of God (for the words "believe not" have more than a negative meaning, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a>), still Christian wives must submit themselves. They must do this for the glory of God, and with the hope of saving their husbands' souls; that those unbelieving husbands may be won to Christ and to everlasting life by the silent eloquence of the quiet self-restraint and holy behavior of their wives, without argument or preaching on the wives' part. A self-denying holy life will do more to win those with whom we live in close intercourse than even holy words, and much more than debate and controversy. This seems to be the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> rather than the other possible interpretation, "without the preaching of the Word." <span class="accented">Be won</span>; literally, <span class="accented">be gained.</span> Each soul converted is a gain to Christ, to the kingdom of heaven, to itself, in this case also to the wife who is the happy instrument of saving her husband (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19, 20</a>). The word rendered "conversation" here, as elsewhere, means "conduct, behavior." (Compare, on the whole subject, the teaching of St. Paul, <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-18.htm">Colossians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-11</a>.)

St. Peter is the apostle of hope. <span class="cmt_word">Adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands.</span> The apostle bids Christian women to consider the example of the saintly women of the Old Testament. With their hope resting upon God, they could not care for finery and costly jewels.

St. Peter singles out Sarah, as the mother of the chosen people. She obeyed her husband habitually (the imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is the reading of some of the oldest manuscripts; the aorist, also well supported, would represent her obedience as a whole, the character of her life now past); she called him lord (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>,  <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.) <span class="cmt_word">Whose daughters ye are</span>; literally, w<span class="accented">hose children ye became.</span> This is another indication that the Epistle is addressed, not only to Jewish Christians, but also, and that in large measure, to Gentile converts. Gentile women became by faith the daughters of Sarah; just as we read in St. Paul's Epistles that "they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>); and that Abraham is "the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised" (<a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>); comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-22.htm">Galatians 4:22-31</a>, where St. Paul tells us that we, like Isaac, are the children of promise; children, "not of the bondwoman, but of the free." <span class="cmt_word">As long as ye do well</span>. This clause represents one Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("doing good"). Some commentators regard the words from "even as Sara" to "whose daughters ye are" as a parenthesis, and refer the participle to "the holy women" mentioned in ver. 5. This does not seem natural. It is better to regard the second half of this verse as a continuous sentence, and to understand the participle as meaning "if ye do well." The doing well, etc., is a mark that Christian women have become children of Sarah by faith. <span class="cmt_word">And are not afraid with any amazement</span>. The Greek word for "amazement" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) does not occur in any other place of the New Testament, though we meet with the corresponding verb in <a href="../../par/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>:87. There seems to be a reference to <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>, "Be not afraid of sudden fear ' (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is "dismay, scared terrified excitement," very different from the calm thoughtful <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the fear lest they should fail in proper respect for their husbands, and that out of the holy fear of God, which St. Peter inculcates upon wives (ver. 2). The Christian wife might often experience cruel treatment from an unbelieving husband, but she was not to live in a flutter of excited terror; she was to be calm and quiet, trusting in God. As to the construction, the accusative may be cognate, as the Authorized Version takes it; or the accusative of the object, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25</a>. The last view is, perhaps, the -most suitable: "And are not afraid of any sudden terror." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with <i>them</i> according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye husbands</span>. As wives are exhorted to be in subjection to their own husbands, so husbands also must do their duty to their wives. The construction (participial as in ver. 1) seems, like ver. 1, to look back to <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-13.htm">1 Peter 2:13</a>. The relation, indeed, is no longer directly one of subjection, and marriage is an ordinance of God; but Christian husbands must submit themselves to the duties arising out of the marriage tie; and marriage involves a civil contract, though to us Christians it is a holy estate instituted of God, and a parable of the mystical union that is betwixt Christ and his Church. St. Peter, we observe, does not consider the case of a Christian husband with an unbelieving wife; probably that would be very uncommon. <span class="cmt_word">Dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel</span>; literally, <span class="accented">living together with the feminine as with the weaker vessel.</span> This connection seems best suited to the balance of the sentence, and also to the sense. The apostle bids the husband, first, to give due consideration to his partner on the ground of her comparative weakness; and, secondly, to give her due honor as being an heir, like himself, of the grace of life. The disparity of the sexes was the cause of the degradation of woman among the heathen; Christianity makes it the ground of tender consideration. Christian love should abound in knowledge (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-9.htm">Philippians 1:9</a>); it should throw its softening light upon all the relations of life. Man and woman are alike vessels - vessels made by God for his service (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-6.htm">Jeremiah 18:6</a>, etc.; also <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4, 5</a>); the woman is the weaker, and must, for that very reason, be treated with gentleness. For "according to knowledge," comp. <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5</a>. Christians must be thoughtful; they must consider what becomes them in all the relations of life; not act carelessly and at random. <span class="cmt_word">And as being heirs together of the grace of life</span>; rather, <span class="accented">rendering honor as to those who are also fellow-heirs</span>, or, according to another well-supported reading, <span class="accented">rendering honor</span> (<span class="accented">to them</span>) <span class="accented">as being also fellow-heirs</span> (<span class="accented">with them</span>). The sense is not materially affected: husband and wife are joint-heirs of the grace of life, that is, of God's gracious gift of everlasting life. <span class="cmt_word">That your prayers be not hindered</span>; or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">be not cut</span> off. If husband and wife live together without mutual reverence and affection, there can be no sympathy in united prayer; the promise made by Christ in <a href="../../par/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a> cannot be realized. Nor can either pray acceptably if they live at variance; jealousies and bickerings are opposed to the spirit of prayer; they hinder the free flow of prayer, and mar its earnestness and devotion.

Some commentators take these words with the preceding: "Ye were called to bless others, that so ye may inherit a blessing." But, on the whole, it seems better to connect them with the following clause: <span class="cmt_word">That ye should inherit a blessing.</span> Christians bless others, not in order that they should inherit a blessing, but because it is God's will and their duty; and that duty follows from the fact that God has made them inheritors of his blessing.

Perhaps the meaning is best given by Bengel, "Qui vult ita vivere, nt ipsum non taedeat vitro" - " Who wishes to live so that he will not weary of life;" so that he may love it, so that he may have a life really worth living. There is a love of life which can only lead to the loss of the true life (<a href="../../par/john/12-25.htm">John 12:25</a>).

The word "refrain" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, literally, "let him make it cease") implies a natural tendency to sins against charity.

God's people must turn away from evil and do good, because the all-seeing eye is upon them; they will find strength to do so, because God heareth prayer. Perhaps when the apostle was writing these words he remembered how once "the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter." <span class="cmt_word">But the face of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> is against them that do evil.</span> The preposition in the two clauses is the same (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, over, or upon).

"Righteousness" here seems synonymous with "that which is good" in the last verse. Christians had often to suffer, not only because of their confession of Christ, but because of the purity of their lives, which was a standing reproach to the heathen. Compare St. Augustine's well-known saying, "Martyrem tacit non poena, sed causa." <span class="cmt_word">And be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled</span>. From <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-12.htm">Isaiah 8:12</a>. The genitive may be taken as objective: "Be not afraid of the terror which they cause;" or as subjective, "with the terror which they feel." The former view is more suitable here.

Whichever translation is adopted, St. Peter here substitutes the Savior's Name where the prophet wrote, "the Lord of hosts, Jehovah Sabaoth" - a change which would be nothing less than impious if the Lord Jesus Christ were not truly God. "Sanctify him," the apostle says (as the Lord himself teaches us to say, in the first words of the Lord's Prayer); that is, regard him as most holy, awful in sanctity; serve him with reverence and godly fear; so you will not "be afraid of their terror." The holy fear of God will lift you above the fear of man. "Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-13.htm">Isaiah 8:13</a>; see also <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-23.htm">Isaiah 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>). St. Peter adds the words, "in your hearts," to teach us that this reverence, this hallowing of the Name of God, must be inward and spiritual, in our inmost being. <span class="cmt_word">And be ready always to give an answer to every man</span>; literally, <span class="accented">ready always for an apology to every man.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is often used of a formal answer before a magistrate, or of a written defense of the faith; but here the addition, "to every man," shows that St. Peter is thinking of informal answers on any suitable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">That asketh you a reason of the here that is in you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">an account concerning the hope.</span> Hope is the grace on which St. Peter lays most stress; it lives in the hearts of Christians. Christians ought to be able to give an account of their hope when asked, both for the defense of the truth and for the good of the asker. That account may be very simple; it may be the mere recital of personal experience - often the most convincing of arguments; it may be, in the case of instructed Christians, profound and closely reasoned. Some answer every Christian ought to be able to give. <span class="cmt_word">With meekness and fear</span>. The best manuscripts read, "but with meekness and fear." The word "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>) is emphatic; argument always involves danger of weakening the spiritual life through pride or bitterness. We must sometimes "contend earnestly for the faith;" but it must be with gentleness and awe. We should fear lest we injure our own souls by arrogant and angry controversy; we should seek the spiritual good of our opponents; and we should entertain a solemn awe of the presence of God, with a trembling anxiety to think and to say only what is acceptable unto him.

St. Peter uses it three times; St. Paul, very frequently. There is a close connection between this clause and the preceding verse. A good conscience is the best reason of the hope that is in us. An apology may be learned, well-expressed, eloquent; but it will not be convincing unless it comes from the heart, and is backed up by the life. Calvin (quoted by Huther) says, "Quid parum auctoritatis habet sermo absque vita." <span class="cmt_word">That, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers.</span> The Revised Version follows the Sinaitic Manuscript in reading, "Wherein ye are spoken against," and omitting "as of evil-doers? It is possible that the received reading may have been interpolated from <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, where the same words occur; except that there the mood is indicative, here, conjunctive, "wherein they may possibly speak evil of you." <span class="cmt_word">They may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ</span>; rather, as the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they may be put to shame</span>; that is, "proved to be liars" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-14.htm">2 Corinthians 7:14</a>). The word translated "falsely accuse" is that which is rendered "despitefully use" in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>. <a href="../../par/luke/6-28.htm">Luke 6:28</a>. It is a strong word. Aristotle defines the corresponding substantive as a thwarting of the wishes of others out of gratuitous malice ('Rhet.,' 2:2). For "good conversation," see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15, 18</a>. The Christian's life is in Christ, in the sphere of his presence, he dwelling in us, and we in him (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, etc.).

St. Peter meets the common objection that suffering could be borne more easily if it were deserved; the Christian must take the cross, if it comes, as from God, sent for his good (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-19.htm">1 Peter 2:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If the will of God be</span> <span class="cmt_word">so;</span> literally, <span class="accented">if the will of God should so will.</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> denotes the will in itself; <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, its active operation (Wirier, 3:65. <span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing</span>. The construction is participial, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-20.htm">1 Peter 2:20</a>. As there, the participle expresses, not merely the circumstances, but the cause of the suffering; they would have to suffer, not simply while they were doing well, but because they did Well. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because Christ also once suffered.</span> Two of the oldest manuscripts read "<span class="accented">died</span>;" but "suffered" corresponds best with the previous verse. The connection is - It must be better to suffer for well-doing, because Christ himself, the All-innocent One, thus suffered, and they who so suffer are made most like unto him. The apostle refers us again to that transcendent Example which was ever before his eyes (compare the close parallel in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26-28</a>). Christ suffered once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); so the sufferings of the Christian are soon over" but for a moment." <span class="accented">For sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>); concerning sins, on account of sins; he, himself sinless, suffered concerning the sins of others. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span> is constantly used in connection with the sin offering in the Septuagint (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-25.htm">Leviticus 6:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-8.htm">Leviticus 5:8-11</a>, etc.; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-6.htm">Hebrews 10:6, 8, 18, 26</a>). The Just for the unjust; literally, <span class="accented">just for unjust.</span> There is no article. The apostle began to speak of the death of Christ, both here and in 1 Peter it., as an example; in both places he seems to be led on by an instinctive feeling that it is scarcely seemly for the Christian to mention that stupendous event without dwelling on its deeper and more mysterious meaning. The preposition used in this clause (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>) does not necessarily convey the idea of vicarious suffering, as <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>) does; it means simply "in behalf of," leaving the character of the relation undetermined; here the context implies the particular relation of substitution (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>; also St. Peter's description of our Lord as "the Just," in <a href="../../par/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That he might bring us to</span> <span class="cmt_word">God.</span> The Vatican and other manuscripts read "you." St. Peter opens out one of the deeper aspects of the death of Christ. The veil that hid the Holiest was then rent in twain, and believers were invited and encouraged to draw near into the immediate presence of God. The verb used here is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>; the corresponding substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>) occurs in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>; also in <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>. In those places it is rendered "access" - we have access to the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit.</span> The Greeks words are, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, the article <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> inserted before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in the received text being without authority. We observe the absence of any article or preposition, and the exact balance and correspondence of the two clauses. The two datives must be taken in the same sense; it is impossible to regard one as the dative of the sphere, and the other as the dative of the instrument; both are evidently datives of "the sphere to which a general predicate is to be limited" (Winer, 31:6. a); they limit the extent of the participles (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-35.htm">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>). Thus the literal translation is, "Being put to death in flesh, but quickened in spirit." For the antithesis of "flesh" and "spirit," common in the New Testament, comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>, "Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness;" and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, "Manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit;" see especially the close parallel in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>, "That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." It seems to follow, from the opposition of flesh and spirit, and from a comparison of the passages quoted above, that by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in this verse we are to understand, not God the Holy Ghost, but the holy human spirit of Christ. In his flesh he was put to death, but in his spirit he was quickened. When the Lord had said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit;" when he bowed his head, and gave up the spirit; - then that spirit passed into a new life. So Bengel excellently says, "Christus, vitam in semet ipso habens, et ipse vita, spiritu vivere neque desiit, neque iterum coepit; sed simulatque per mortificationem involucre infirmitatis in carne solutus erat, <span class="accented">statim</span> vitae solvi nesciae virtus modis novis et multo expeditissimis sese exserere coepit." Christ, being delivered from the burden of that suffering flesh which he had graciously taken for our salvation, was quickened in his holy human spirit - quickened to new energies, new and blessed activities. So it shall be with those who suffer for well-doing; they may even be put to death in the flesh, but "if we die with him, we shall also live with him." It is far better (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to depart and to be with Christ, to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord. They that are Christ's shall, like their Master, be quickened in the spirit; they pass at once into the new life of Paradise; their works follow them thither; it may be, we cannot tell, they will be employed in blessed work for Christ, being made like unto him not only in some degree during their earthly life, but also in the intermediate state of rest and hope. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in which</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>). The Lord was no longer in the flesh; the component parts of his human nature were separated by death; his flesh lay in the grave. As he had gone about doing good in the flesh, so now he went in the spirit - in his holy human spirit. <span class="accented">He went.</span> The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) occurs again in ver. 22, "who is <span class="accented">gone</span> into heaven." It must have the same meaning in both places; in ver. 22 it asserts a change of locality; it must do the like here. There it is used of the ascent into heaven; it can scarcely mean here that, without any such change of place, Christ preached, not in his own Person, but through Noah or the apostles. Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a> (the Epistle which seems to have been so much in St. Peter's thoughts), "Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?" <span class="accented">And preached</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). It is the word constantly used of the Lord from the time when "Jesus began to preach (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>). Then, himself in our human flesh, he preached to men living in the flesh - to a few of his own age and country. Now the range of his preaching was extended;  himself in the spirit, he preached to spirits: "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>; spiritu, spiritibus." says Bengel; "<span class="accented">congruens sermo."</span> He preached <span class="accented">also</span> to the spirits; not only once to living men, but now also to spirits, even to them. The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> calls for attention; it implies a new and additional fact; it emphasizes the substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The preaching and the condition of the hearers are mentioned together; they were spirits when they heard the preaching. It seems impossible to understand these words of preaching through Noah or the apostles to men who passed afterwards into the state of disembodied spirits. And he preached in the spirit. The words seem to limit the preaching to the time when the Lord's soul was left in Hades (<a href="../../par/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>). Huther, indeed, says that "<span class="accented">as</span> both expressions (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) apply to Christ in his entire Person, consisting of body and soul, what follows must not be conceived as an activity which he exercised in his spirit only, and whilst separated from his body." But does <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> apply to body and <span class="accented">soul?</span> Men "are not able to kill the soul." And is it true, as Huther continues, that the first words of this verse are not opposed to the view that Christ preached in his glorified body, "inasmuch as in <span class="accented">this</span> body the Lord is no longer <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>, but entirely <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>?

He preached to "the spirits <span class="accented">in prison</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span>)."

It cannot mean the whole realm of the dead, but only that part of Hades in which the souls of the ungodly are reserved unto the day of judgment. Bengel says, "In carcere puniuntur sontes: in <span class="accented">custodia</span> servantur, dum experiantur quid facturus sit judex?"

Omit the word "once" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>), which is without authority. <span class="accented">Wherein</span>; literally, <span class="accented">into which</span>; they were saved by entering into it. The last words may mean, "they were carried safely through the water," or, "they were saved by water;" that is, the water bore up the ark (<a href="../../par/genesis/7-17.htm">Genesis 7:17, 18</a>). The argument of ver. 21 makes the second interpretation the more probable. The verse now before us limits the area of the Lord's preaching: without it we might have supposed that he preached to the whole multitude of the dead, or at least to all the ungodly dead whose spirits were in prison. Why does St. Peter specify the generation that was swept away by the Flood? Did they need the preaching of the Christ more than other sinful souls? or was there any special reason why that grace should be vouchsafed to them rather than to others? The fact must have been revealed to the apostle; but evidently we are in the presence of a mystery into which we can see only a little way. Those antediluvians were a conspicuous instance of men who suffered for evil doing (see ver. 17); as Christ is the transcendent Example of one who suffered for well-doing. It is better to suffer with him than with them: they are in prison. His chosen are with him in Paradise. But St. Peter cannot rest in the contemplation of the Lord's death as an example; he must pass on to the deeper, the more mysterious aspects of that most stupendous or' events. The Lord suffered concerning sins, for the sake of unrighteous men; not only did he die for them, he did not rest from his holy work even while his sacred body lay in the grave; he went and preached to some whose <span class="accented">sins</span> had been most notorious, and most signally punished. The judgment had been one of unexampled awfulness; eight souls only were saved in the ark, many thousands perished. It may be that St. Peter mentions the fewness of the saved to indicate one reason for this gracious visit. It seems that the awful destruction of the Deluge had made a deep impression upon his mind; he mentions it twice in his Second Epistle (2 Peter 2:5; 3:6); he saw in it a solemn anticipation of the last tremendous judgment. Doubtless he remembered well how the Lord, in his great prophetic discourse upon the Mount of Olives, had compared the days of Noah to the coming of the Son of man (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>); those words seem to give a special character to the Deluge, separating it from other lesser judgments, and investing it with a peculiar awfulness. It may be that the apostle's thoughts had dwelt much upon the many mysterious problems (such as the great destruction of infant life) connected with it; and that a special revelation was vouchsafed to him to clear up some of his difficulties. These spirits, in prison at the time of the descent into Hades, had aforetime been disobedient. The Greek word (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) means literally "disbelieving;" but here, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-7.htm">1 Peter 2:7</a> and elsewhere, it stands for that willful unbelief which sets itself in direct opposition to the will of God. They were guilty of unbelief, and of the disobedience which results from unbelief. Noah was a "preacher of righteousness" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>, where the Greek word is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, the substantive corresponding with the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> here); the vast structure of the ark was a standing warning as it rose slowly before their eyes. The long-suffering of God waited all those hundred and twenty years (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>), as now the Lord is "long-suffering to usward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). But they heeded neither the preaching of Noah nor the long-suffering of God; and at last "the Flood came, and took them all away. So shall also the coming of the Son of man be." Eight only were saved then; they doubtless suffered for well-doing; they had to endure much scorn and derision, perhaps persecution. But they were not disobedient. "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house." The eight were brought safe through (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); they were saved through the water; the water bore them up, possibly rescued them from persecution. But the rest perished; the destruction of life was tremendous; we know not how many thousands perished: they suffered for evil-doing. But the degrees of guilt must have varied greatly from open pro-faulty and hostility to silent doubt; while there were many children and very young persons; and it may be that many repented at the last moment. It is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing; but even suffering for evil-doing is sometimes blessed to the salvation of the soul; and it may be that some of these, having been "judged according to men in the flesh," now "live according to God in the spirit" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>). For it is impossible to believe that the Lord's preaching was a "concio damnatoria." The Lord spoke sternly sometimes in the days of his flesh, but it was the warning voice of love; even that sternest denunciation of the concentrated guilt and hypocrisy of the Pharisees ended in a piteous wail of loving sorrow. It cannot he that the most merciful Savior would have visited souls irretrievably lost merely to upbraid them and to enhance their misery. He had just suffered for <span class="accented">sins</span>, the Just for the unjust: is it not possible that one of the effects of that suffering might have been "to bring unto God" some souls who once had been alienated from God by wicked works, but had not wholly hardened their hearts; who, like the men of Tyro and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, had not the opportunities which we enjoy, who had not been once enlightened and made partakers of the heavenly gift and the powers of the world to come? Is it not possible that in those words, "which <span class="accented">sometime</span> were disobedient," there may be a hint that that disobedience of theirs was not the "eternal sin" which, according to the reading of the two most ancient manuscripts in <a href="../../par/mark/3-29.htm">Mark 3:29</a>, is the awful lot of those who have never forgiveness? The Lord <span class="accented">preached</span> to the spirits in prison; that word (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) is commonly used of the heralds of salvation, and St. Peter himself, in the next chapter, tells us that "the gospel was preached (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) to them that are dead." The gospel is the good tidings of salvation through the cross of Christ. The Lord had just died upon the cross: is it not possible that, in the moment of victory, he announced the saving power of the cross to some who had greatly sinned; as at the time of his resurrection "many bodies of the saints who slept arose"? There is one more question which forces itself upon us - What was the result of this preaching? Did the spirits in prison listen to the Savior's voice? Were they delivered from that prison where they had been so long confined? Here Scripture is almost silent; yet we read the words of hope in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>, "For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." The good news was announced to them that they might live; then may we not dare to hope that some at least listened to that gracious preaching, and were saved even out of that prison by the power of the Savior's cross? May we not venture to believe, with the author of the ' Christian Year,' that even in that dreary scene the Savior's eye reached the thronging band of sou]s, and that his cross and Passion, his agony and bloody sweat, might (we know not how or in what measure) "set the shadowy realms from sin and sorrow free?" It seems desirable to add a brief summary of the history of opinion on this much-controverted passage. The early Greek Fathers appear to have held, with one consent, that St. Peter is here speaking of that descent into Hades of which he had spoken in his first great sermon (<a href="../../par/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>). Justin Martyr, in his' Dialogue with Trypho' (sect. 72), accuses the Jews of having erased from the prophecies of Jeremiah the following words: "The Lord God of Israel remembered his dead who slept in the land of the tomb, and descended to them to preach to them the good news of his salvation." Irenseus quotes the same passage, attributing it in one place to Isaiah, in another to Jeremiah, and adds that the Lord's purpose was to deliver them and to save them (<span class="accented">extrahere eos et salvare cos</span>). Tertullian says that the Lord descended into the lower parts of the earth, to make the patriarchs partakers of himself (<span class="accented">compotes sui</span>; 'De Anima,' c. 55). Clement of Alexandria quotes Hermas as saying that "the apostles and teachers who had preached the Name of the Son of God and had fallen asleep, preached by his power and faith to those who had fallen asleep before them" ('Strom.,' 2:9). "And then," Bishop Pearson, from whose notes on the Creed these quotations are taken, continues, "Clement supplies that authority with a reason of his own, that as the apostles were to imitate Christ while they lived, so did they also imitate him after death, and therefore preached to the souls in Hades, as Christ did before them." The earliest writers do not seem to have thought that any change in the condition of the dead was produced by Christ's descent into Hades. The Lord announced the gospel to the dead; the departed saints rejoiced to hear the glad tidings, as now the angels rejoice over each repentant sinner. Origen, in his second homily on 1 Kings, taught that the Lord, descending into Hades, brought the souls of the holy dead, the patriarchs and prophets, out of Hades into Paradise; no souls could pass the flaming sword till he had led the way; but now, through his grace and power, the blessed dead who die in the Lord enter at once into the rest of Paradise - not yet heaven, but an intermediate place of rest, far better than that from which the saints of the old covenant were delivered. In this view Origen was followed by many of the later Fathers. But St. Peter says nothing of any preaching to departed saints. Christ "went and preached," he says, "unto the spirits in prison, which sometime were disobedient." Hence Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and others were led to suppose that the Lord not only raised the holy dead to a higher state of blessedness, but preached also to the disobedient, and that some of these believed, and were by his grace delivered from "prison." Some few, as Cyril of Alexandria, held that the Lord spoiled the house of the strong man armed (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), and released all his captives. This Augustine reckoned as a heresy. But in his epistle to Euodius (Ep. 99 and 164) Augustine, much exercised (as he says, "vehementissime commotus") by the difficulties of the question, propounded the interpretation which became general in the Western Church, being adopted by Bode, Thomas Aquinas, De Lyra, and later by Beza, Hammond, Leighton, Pearson, etc. "The spirits in prison," he says, "are the unbelieving who lived in the days of Noah, whose spirits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> souls, had been shut up in the flesh and in the darkness of ignorance, as in a prison [comp. ' Paradise Lost,' 11:723]. Christ preached to them, not in the flesh, inasmuch as he was not yet incarnate, but in the spirit, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his Divine nature (<span class="accented">secundum divinitatem</span>)." But this interpretation does not satisfy St. Peter's words. The hypothesis that Christ preached through the instrumentality of Noah does not adequately represent the participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>; the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> cannot be taken metaphorically of the flesh in which the soul is confined. If, with Beza, we understand it as meaning "who are now in prison," we escape one difficulty, but another is introduced; for it is surely forced and unnatural to make the time of the verb and that of the dative clause different. The words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;</span> must describe the condition of the spirits at the time of the Savior's preaching. Some commentators, as Socinus and Grotius, refer St. Peter's words to the preaching of Christ through the apostles. These writers understand <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of the prison of the body, or the prison of sin; and explain St. Peter as meaning that Christ preached through the apostles to the Jews who were under the yoke of the Law, and to the Gentiles who lay under the power of the devil; and they regard the disobedient in the time of Noah as a sample of sinners in any age. But this interpretation is altogether arbitrary, and cannot be reconciled with the apostle's words. Other views are - that our Lord descended into hell to triumph over Satan (on which see Pearson on the Creed, art. 5.); that his preaching was a <span class="accented">concio damnatoria - an</span> announcement of condemnation, not of salvation (which is disproved by <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-6.htm">1 Peter 4:6</a>); that the spirits in prison were holy souls waiting for Christ, the prison being (according to Calvin) "specula, sire ipse excubandi actus;" that they were heathens, who lived according to their light, but in idolatry. We may mention, in conclusion, the monstrous explanation of the heretic Marcion, that they were those who in the Old Testament are called ungodly, but were really better than those whom the Old Testament regards as saints.

Thus the literal translation will be, "Which (as) antitype is saving you also, (namely) baptism;" that is, the water which is saving you is the antitype of the water of the Flood. That water was made the means of saving a few; it bore up the ark in which they were. It saved them, perhaps, from the malice of the ungodly; it saved them from that corruption which was almost universal; it was the means of saving the race of men as by a new birth through death into a new life, a new beginning; it washed away the evil, those who suffered for evil-doing, and so saved those who had doubtless been suffering for well-doing. Thus it is the figure (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of the antitype (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baptism; the two (the water of the Flood and the water of baptism) correspond as type and antitype.

Here the water of the Flood is the prophetic foretype; baptism is the accomplishment. "Baptism," St. Peter says, "is saving you," the few Christians, separating you from the vast number of Gentiles, whom in some sense it condemns through their rejection of God's offered mercy (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-7.htm">Hebrews 11:7</a>), saving you from the corruption of their evil example, bringing you into the ark of Christ's Church, bearing up that ark through the grace of the new birth. The apostle says, "Baptism is saving you;" he does not say, "hits saved;" he is using the present tense in its proper sense of an incomplete action; it brings us into a state of salvation, into covenant with God. But it is only the beginning, the birth; the growth must follow; the death unto sin, the new birth unto righteousness, must be realized in actual life; otherwise, alas! we shall have received the grace of God in vain (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>). (<span class="cmt_word">Not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God.)</span> St. Peter hastens to explain his statement. Baptism doth save us, but not the mere outward ceremony; you may "make clean the outside" with the most scrupulous care; you may be very careful in putting away the filth of the flesh (or, if the genitive is to be regarded as subjective, with Bengel, the flesh may put away its filth); but more is needed than the old Jewish washings, the frequent purifications.

Observe that St. Peter uses the word here rendered "putting away" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) again in the Second Epistle (1. 14) of putting off the earthly tabernacle (comp. also <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a>, where he uses the corresponding participle, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). The next clause presents great difficulty. Is the genitive subjective or objective? What is the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>? The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs only in one other place in the Greek Scriptures (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a> [in the Authorized Version, 4:17D, where it is translated "demand;" the corresponding verb is of frequent occurrence; as in <a href="../../par/romans/10-20.htm">Romans 10:20</a>, "them that asked not after me;" and <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-7.htm">2 Kings 11:7</a> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-7.htm">2 Samuel 11:7</a>, in the Authorized Version), where it is joined with the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, as in this verse. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> seems to mean an "inquiry," and the genitive is probably subjective. The inner meaning of baptism is not that the flesh puts away its filth, but that a good conscience inquires after God. The outward and visible sign doth not save if separated from the inward and spiritual grace. The first is necessary, for it is an outward sign appointed by Christ; but it will not save without the second; those who draw near to God must have their bodies washed with pure water, but also their hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-22.htm">Hebrews 10:22</a>). The inner cleansing of the soul results in a good conscience, a consciousness of sincerity, of good intentions and desires, which will instinctively seek after God. And that good conscience is the effect of baptism, when baptism has its perfect work, when those who have once been grafted into the true Vine abide in Christ, when those who have once been baptized in one Spirit into one body keep the unity of the Spirit, Christ dwelling in them, and they in Christ. Archbishop Leighton explains the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> as "the whole correspondence of the conscience with God, and with itself as towards God, or in the sight of God." If the genitive is regarded as objective, the meaning will be, "an inquiry addressed to God for a good conscience;" the soul, once awakened, seeks continually fuller purification, hungers and thirsts after righteousness. This gives a good sense, but seems less suitable in this context. It is possible also to join the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of a good conscience in relation to God; but it seems much more natural to connect it with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. Some commentators follow AEcumenius in paraphrasing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; they take the ground that, in legal language, the word was used in the sense of a contract, and they see in St. Peter's words a reference to the covenant made with God in baptism, and to the questions and answers in which, from the earliest times, that covenant was expressed; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> being used in a general sense so as to cover answers as well as questions. This is a possible alternative, but the word seems to have acquired this meaning in later times. <span class="cmt_word">By the resurrection of Jesus Christ</span>. These words refer back to "baptism doth also now save us." Baptism derives its saving effect from the resurrection of our Lord; without that resurrection it would be an empty form (see note on 1 Peter 1:3).

It is better to suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing, for he who is the signal Example, who suffered, the Just for the unjust, is now exalted to the right hand of the Majesty on high; and "is able to save them to the uttermost that come to God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them." <span class="cmt_word">Angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him</span>. God "hath set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come."

The words seem to include, especially when read in comparison with <a href="../../par/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, the evil angels also; they are made subject against their will to Christ; they asked him once if he was come to torment them before the time.

The words "for us" are omitted in some ancient manuscripts; they express a great truth already dwelt upon in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2.htm">1 Peter 2</a>. and 3. Here the apostle is insisting upon the example of Christ, not on the atoning efficacy of his death. Arm yourselves likewise with the same mind. The word rendered "mind" (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is more exactly "thought" (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>, the only other place where it occurs in the New Testament); but it certainly has sometimes the force of "intention, resolve." The Christian must be like his Mustier; he must arm himself with the great thought, the holy resolve, which was in the mind of Christ - the thought that suffering borne in faith frees us from the power of sin, the resolve to suffer patiently according to the will of God. That thought, which can be made our own only by faith, is the Christian's shield; we are to arm ourselves with it against the assaults of the evil one (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin.</span> The thought is that of <a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6-11</a>. Some translate the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "that," and understand it as giving the content of the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "Arm yourselves with the thought that," etc.; but this does not give so good a sense, and would seem to require <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x28;</span> " this thought," rather than "the same thought." Some, again, understand this clause of Christ; but this seems a mistake. The apostle spoke first of the Master; now he turns to the disciple. Take, he says, for your amour the thoughts which filled the sacred heart of Christ - the thought that suffering in the flesh is not, as the world counts it, an unmixed evil, but often a deep blessing; for, or because, he that suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin. If, when we are called to suffer, we offer up our sufferings to Christ who suffered for us, and unite our sufferings with his by faith in him, then those sufferings, thus sanctified, destroy the power of sin, and make us cease from sin (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-2.htm">1 Peter 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">That he no longer should live the rest of <i>his</i> time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh.</span> On the whole, it seems better to connect this clause with the imperative: "Arm yourselves with the same mind, that ye no longer should live the rest of your time;" rather than with the clause immediately preceding: "He that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; that he no longer should live," etc.; though both connections give a good sense. The Greek word for "live" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) occurs only here in the New Testament. Bengel says, "Aptum verbum, non die fur de brutis.' "In the flesh "<span class="accented">here</span> means simply "in the body," in this mortal life. "<span class="accented">The</span> rest of your time" suggests the solemn thought of the shortness of our earthly pilgrimage: bye for eternity. <span class="cmt_word">To the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</span> The datives are normal; they express the pattern or rule according to which our life ought to be fashioned. God's will is our sanctification (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>). That will is ever the same, a fixed, unchanging rule; the lusts of men are shifting, uncertain, restless. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">For the time past of <i>our</i> life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the time past may suffice.</span> The words, "of our life" and "us," are not found in the best manuscripts. St. Peter could not include himself among those who wrought the will of the Gentiles. The Greek word for "will" here is, according to the best manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; in ver. 2 "the will of God" is <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The general distinction is that <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> implies choice and purpose, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> merely inclination (compare, in the Greek, <a href="../../par/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13, 14</a>). The change of word seems to point to such a distinction here. God's will is a fixed, holy purpose; the will, or rather wish, of the Gentiles was uncertain inclination, turned this way or that way by changeful lusts. The perfect infinitive, "to have wrought," implies that that part of life ought to be regarded as a thing wholly past and gone. The whole sentence has a tone of solemn irony. "Fastidium peccati apud resipiscentes" (Bengel); comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-21.htm">Romans 6:21</a>. St. Peter is here addressing Gentile Christians. Fronm&uuml;ller's objection is peculiar: "Suppose that the readers of Peter's Epistle had formerly been heathens, his reproaching them with having formerly done the will of the Gentiles would surely be singular." They had done the will of the Gentiles; they were now, as Christians, to do the will of God. When we walked in lasciviousness, <span class="cmt_word">lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings,</span> and abominable idolatries; better, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">and to have walked.</span> There is no pronoun. Lusts are the hidden sins of unclean thought, which lead to outbreaks of lasciviousness. The Greek word for "revellings" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) is one often used of drunken youths parading the streets, or of festal processions in honor of Bacchus. The word translated "banquetings" means rather "drinking-bouts." The word for "abominable" is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, unlawful, nefarious,  contrary to the eternal principles of the Divine Law; "quibus sanctissimum Dei jus violatur" (Bengel). St. Peter is probably referring, not only to the sin of idolatry in itself, but also to the many licentious practices connected with it. After the persecution of Nero, in which St. Peter perished, Christianity was regarded by the state as a <span class="accented">religio illicita.</span> Christianity was condemned by the law of Rome; idolatry is opposed to the eternal Law of God. This verse could not have been addressed to Hebrew Christians.

The word for "excess" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is found here only in the New Testament; it means" an overflowing;" the <span class="accented">rendering sentina</span> ("a sewer" or "cesspool") is doubtful. The word rendered "riot" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) occurs also in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>, and is used in the adverbial form in describing the recklessness of the prodigal son (<a href="../../par/luke/15-13.htm">Luke 15:13</a>). It means that lost state in which a man is given up to self-indulgence, and saves neither reputation, earthly position, nor his immortal soul. <span class="cmt_word">Speaking evil of you</span>; better, perhaps, translated literally, <span class="accented">blaspheming.</span> The words "of you" are not in the original; they who revile Christians for well-doing are blasphemers, they speak really against God.

We naturally refer these last words to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> of the preceding verse. The apostle seems to be meeting an objection. The Thessalonian Christians feared lest believers who fell asleep before the second advent should lose something of the blessedness of those who should be alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord. On the other hand, some of St. Peter's readers may, perhaps, have thought that those who had passed away before the gospel times could not be justly judged in the same way as those who then were living. The two classes, the living and the dead, were separated by a great difference: the living had heard the gospel, the dead had not; the living had opportunities and privileges which had not been granted to the dead. But, St. Peter says, the gospel was preached also to the dead; they too heard the glad tidings of salvation (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). Some have thought that the word "<span class="accented">dead"</span> is used metaphorically for the dead in trespasses and sins. But it seems scarcely possible to give the word a literal sense in ver. 5 and a metaphorical sense in ver. 6. Some understand the apostle as meaning that the gospel had been preached to those who then were dead, before their death; but it seems unnatural to assign different times to the verb and the substantive. The aorist <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> directs our thoughts to some definite occasion. The absence of the article (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) should also be noticed; the words assert that the gospel was preached to dead persons - to some that were (lead. These considerations lead us to connect the passage with <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19, 20</a>. There St. Peter tells us that Christ himself went and preached in the spirit "to the spirits in prison;" then the gospel was preached, the good news of salvation was announced, to some that were dead. The article is absent both here and in ver. 5 (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). All men, quick and dead alike, must appear before the judgment-seat of Christ; so St. Peter may not have intended to limit the area of the Lord's preaching in Hades here, as he had done in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3.htm">1 Peter 3</a>. There he mentioned one section only of the departed; partly because the Deluge furnished a conspicuous example of men who suffered for evil-doing, partly because he regarded it as a striking type of Christian baptism. Here, perhaps, he asserts the general fact - the gospel was preached to the dead; perhaps (we may not presume to dogmatize in a matter so mysterious, about which so little is revealed) to all the vast population of the underworld, who had passed away before the gospel times. Like the men of Tyre and Sidon, of Sodom and Gomorrah, they had not seen the works or heard the words of Christ during their life on the earth; now they heard from the Lord himself what he had done for the salvation of mankind. Therefore God was ready to judge the quick and the dead, for to both was the gospel preached. <span class="cmt_word">That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live  according to God in the spirit.</span> The gospel was preached to the dead for this end (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), that they might be judged indeed (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>), but nevertheless live (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The last clause expresses the end and purpose of the preaching; the former clause, though grammatically dependent upon the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, states a necessity antecedent to the preaching (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>, "God be thanked that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart;" and Romans 8:10, "If Christ be in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." The meaning seems to be - the gospel was preached to the dead, that, though they were judged, yet they might live. They had suffered the judgment of death, the punishment of human sin. Christ had been put to death in the flesh (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) for the sins of others; the dead had suffered death in the flesh for their own sins. They had died before the manifestation of the Son of God, before the great work of atonement wrought by his death; but that atonement was retrospective - he "taketh away the sin of the <span class="accented">world</span>;" its saving influences extended even to the realm of the dead. The gospel was preached to the dead, that, though they were judged according to men (that is, after the fashion of men, as all men are judged), yet they might live in the spirit (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>, "To deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "might he judged," is aorist, as describing a single fact; the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, "might live," is present, as describing a continual state. <span class="accented">According to God.</span> God is Spirit; and as they that worship him must worship in spirit, so they who believe in him shall live in spirit.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the end of all things is at hand.</span> The mention of the judgment turns St. Peter's thoughts into another channel. The end is at hand, not only the judgment of persecutors and slanderers, but the end of persecutions and sufferings, the end of our great conflict with sin, the end of our earthly probation: therefore prepare to meet your God. The end is at hand: it hath drawn near. St. Peter probably, like the other apostles, looked for the speedy coming of the Lord. It was not for him, as it is not for us, "to know the times or the seasons" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). It is enough to know that our own time is short. When St. Peter wrote these words, the end of the holy city, the center of the ancient dispensation, was very near at hand; and behind that awful catastrophe lay the incomparably more tremendous judgment, of which the fall of Jerusalem was a figure. That judgment, we know now, was to be separated by a wide interval from the dale of St. Peter's Epistle. But that interval is measured, in the prophetic outlook, not by months and years. We are now living in "the last times" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). The coming of our Lord was the hennaing of the last period in the development of God's dealings with mankind; there is no further dispensation to be looked for. "Not only is there nothing mere between the Christian's present state of salvation and the end, but the former is itself already the end, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the beginning of the end" (Schott, quoted by Huther). <span class="cmt_word">Be ye therefore sober</span>; rather, <span class="accented">self-restrained, calm, thoughtful.</span> The thought of the nearness of the end should not lead to excitement and neglect of common duties, as it did in the case of the Thessalonian Christians, and again at the approach of the thousandth year of our era. <span class="cmt_word">And watch unto prayer;</span> rather, <span class="accented">be sober unto prayers.</span> The word translated "watch" in the Authorized Version is not that which we read in our Lord's exhortation to "watch and pray." The word used here (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) rather points to temperance, abstinence from strong drinks, though it suggests also that wariness and cool thoughtfulness which are destroyed by excess. The Christian must be self-restrained and sober, and that with a view to perseverance in prayer. The aorist imperatives, perhaps, imply that St. Peter's readers needed to be stirred up (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>), to be aroused from that indifference into which men are so apt to fall. The exhortation to persevere in watchfulness would be expressed by the present. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And above all things have fervent</span> <span class="cmt_word">charity among yourselves;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">before all things, having your love towards one another intense.</span> The existence of charity is taken for granted. Christians must love one another; love is the very badge of their profession. The apostle urges his readers to keep that love intense, and that before all things; for charity is the first of Christian graces. (On the word "intense" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>), see note on 1 Peter 1:22.) <span class="cmt_word">For charity shall cover the multitude of sins</span>. Read and translate, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">for love covereth a multitude of sins.</span> If St. Peter is directly quoting <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, he is not using the Septuagint, as he commonly does, but translating from the Hebrew. The Septuagint rendering is quite different, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. But it may be that the words had become proverbial. We find them also in <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>, "He which converteth the sinner...  shall hide a multitude of sins." St. James means that he will obtain God's forgiveness for the converted sinner; but in <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a> the meaning (as is plain from the context) is that love covers the sins of others; does not stir up strifes, as hatred does, but promotes concord by concealing and forgiving sins. This is probably St. Peter's meaning here: "Take care that your charity is intense, for only thus can you forgive as you are bidden to forgive, as you hope to be forgiven." Perhaps he was thinking of the "seventy times seven," to which the Lord had told him that forgiveness was to extend. But his words may well be understood as implying more than this. Love shown in forgiving others will win forgiveness for yourselves: "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven." Love manifested in converting others will cover their sins, and obtain God's forgiveness for them. In the deepest sense, it is only the love of Christ energizing in his atoning work which can cover sin; but true charity, Christian love, flows from that holiest love. "Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God." Therefore in some sense Christian love, flowing from the love of Christ, and bringing the Christian very near to Christ, covers sins; for it keeps the Christian close to the cross, within the immediate sphere of the blessed influences of the atonement, so that he becomes a center of grace, a light kindled from the true Light, a well of living waters fed by the one fountain which is opened for sin and for uncleanness. The mutual love of Christians, their kindly words and deeds, check the work of sin; their prayers, their intercessions, call down the forgiveness of God. Therefore, in the view of the approaching end, charity is before all things precious for our own souls and for the souls of others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-9.htm">1 Peter 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Use hospitality one to another</span>; literally, <span class="accented">being hospitable</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> 3John 5). Hospitality must have been a necessary, and often a costly, duty in the early ages of the Church. There was no public provision for the poor. Christians traveling from place to place would find no suitable shelter except in the houses of Christians. They would be obliged to avoid the public houses of entertainment, where they would be exposed often to danger, always to temptation; only the private houses of Christians would be safe for them. Hence the use of the "letters of commendation," mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>). Those who brought such letters were to be received in Christian homes. The well-known 'Teaching of the Twelve Apostles' speaks of this right of hospitality, and gives cautions against its abuse. Tim apostle is not speaking of ordinary social gatherings; they have their place and their utility in the Christian life, but they do not, as a rule, afford scope for the higher self-denials of Christian charity (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/14-12.htm">Luke 14:12, 13</a>). Without grudging. Such hospitality would be always costly, often inconvenient, sometimes attended with danger, as in the case of the first British martyr; but it was to be without murmuring. Murmuring would take from the hospitality all its beauty; it should be offered as a gift of love, and Christian love can never murmur (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).

One of those gifts is utterance. The apostle means all Christian utterance, whether public in the Church, or private in Christian conversation or ministrations to the sick. The second clause may be also rendered, as in the Revised Version, "speaking as it were oracles of God." It is more natural to supply the participle" speaking" than "let him speak," after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("ministering") in ver. 10. For the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, oracles, see <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>; also <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, in which last place the Scriptures of the New Testament seem to be intended. The apostle's meaning may be either that the Christian teacher was to speak as do the oracles of God, that is, the Scriptures, or (and the absence of the article rather favors this view) that he was so to yield himself to the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that his teaching should be the teaching of God; he was to seek no praise or reward for himself, but only the glory of God. Those who with single-hearted zeal seek God's glory do speak as it were oracles of God, for he speaketh by them (camp. <a href="../../par/mark/13-11.htm">Mark 13:11</a>). If any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth. Again it is better to supply the participle "ministering." Whatever a man's gifts may be, he must minister them for the good of the whole Church (see ver. 9; also <a href="../../par/romans/12.htm">Romans 12</a>. S; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And this he must do as of the strength which God supplieth</span>; the strength is not his - God giveth it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, rendered "giveth," is used in classical Greek first of supplying the expenses of a chorus, then of liberal giving generally; it occurs in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>. The compound, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, is more common; St. Peter has it in the Second Epistle (1. 5, 11). That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ. The glory of God should be the one end of all Christian work. The Lord himself had said so in the sermon on the mount, in words doubtless well remembered by the apostle (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; camp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">whose is the glory and dominion for the ages of ages.</span> It is thought by some that St. Peter is here quoting from some ancient form of prayer; the use of the "Amen," and the resemblance to <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a> and Rev 5:13, seem to favor this supposition. It is uncertain whether this doxology is addressed to God the Father or to the Lord Jesus Christ; the order of the words is in favor of the latter view, and the doxology closely resembles that in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>.

The address, "beloved," as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>, shows the depth of his sympathy with them. He resumes the thought of <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>; the persecution is a burning, a fiery furnace, which is being kindled among them for a trial, to try the strength of their faith. The present participles imply that the persecution was already beginning; the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, a burning (see <a href="../../par/revelation/18-9.htm">Revelation 18:9, 18</a>), shows the severity. St. Peter tells them its meaning: it was to prove them; it would turn to their good. Persecution was not to be regarded as a strange thing. The Lord had foretold its coming. St. Paul, in his first visit to Asia Minor, had warned them that "<span class="accented">we</span> must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." (On the word <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, see note on ver. 4.)

Suffering meekly borne draws the Christian nearer to Christ, lifts him, as on a cross, nearer to the crucified Lord; but this it does only when he looks to Jesus in his suffering, when the eye of faith is fixed upon the cross of Christ. Then faith unites the sufferings of the disciple with the sufferings of his Lord; he is made a partaker of Christ's sufferings; and so far as suffering has that blessed result, in such measure he must rejoice in his sufferings. That, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy; literally, <span class="accented">that in the revelation of Ms glory also ye may rejoice exulting.</span> The word for "exulting," <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, corresponds with that used in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6</a> and in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>).

It cannot be taken here in its ecclesiastical sense, "<span class="accented">let</span> no man suffer <span class="cmt_word">as</span> a bishop in matters which do not concern him; but if as a Christian (bishop), let him not be ashamed." The Jews were often accused of constituting themselves judges and meddling in other men's matters; it may be that the consciousness of spiritual knowledge and high spiritual dignity exposed Christians to the same temptation. Hilgenfeld sees here an allusion to Trajan's laws against informers, and uses it as an argument for his theory of the late date of this Epistle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">Yet if <i>any man suffer</i> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet if any man suffer as a Christian</span>. The word "Christian" occurs only three times in the New Testament - twice in the Acts of the Apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>), and here. "The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." They were originally described amongst themselves as "the disciples," "the brethren," "the believers," "the elect," or" the saints;" by the Jews they were called "the Nazarenes" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>), as still in Mohammedan countries. The name was probably invented by the heathen, and used at first as a term of derision; there is something of scorn in Agrippa's use of it. It did not at once become common among the disciples of the Lord. St. Peter (who preached at Antioch (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and is said to have been Bishop of Antioch) is the only sacred writer who adopts it instead of the older names, and that only ones, and in connection with threatened persecution. St. James may possibly allude to it in <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. But it was not commonly used among' believers till after New Testament times. Then they began to discern its admirable suitableness. It reminded them that the center of their religion was not a system of doctrines, but a Person, and that Person the Messiah, the Anointed of God. The Hebrew origin of the word, the Greek dress, the Latin termination, seemed to point, like the threefold inscription on the cross, to the universality of Christ's religion to its empire, first over all the civilized nations, and through them, by continually increasing triumphs, over the whole world. It reminded them that they too were anointed, that they had an unction from the Holy One. Its very corruption through heathen ignorance, <span class="accented">Christian</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, good (the Sinaitic Manuscript has <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in this place) had its lesson - it spoke of sweetness and of goodness. See the oft-quoted passage from Tertullian: "Sed quum et perperam Chres-tiani nuncupamur a vobis (nam nec nominis certa est notitia penes yes) de suavitate et benignitate compositum est." <span class="cmt_word">Let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</span> The best-supported reading is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>. This may be understood as an idiom, in the same sense as the reading of the Authorized Version; but it is better to translate it literally, <span class="accented">in this name, i.e.</span> either the name of Christ, or (more probably, perhaps) that of Christian. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen blasphemed that worthy Name</span>; suffering  Christians must not be ashamed of it, but, as the holy martyrs did, utter their "Christianus sum" with inward peace and thanksgiving, glorifying God that he had given them grace to bear that honored Name and to suffer for Christ. Bengel says here, "Poterat Petrus dicere, honori sibi ducat: sed honorem Dee resignandum esse docet."

The judgment must begin at the sanctuary (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>; see also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>). The beginning of judgment is the persecution of the Christians, as our Lord had taught (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-8.htm">Matthew 24:8, 9</a>, and following verses); but that judgment is not unto condemnation: "When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-32.htm">1 Corinthians 11:32</a>); it is the fiery trial, "which is much more precious than of gold that perisheth," the refining fire of affliction. And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? Compare the passage in Jeremiah already referred to: "Behold, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my Name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?" Compare also our Lord's question, "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" Gerhard (quoted by Huther) rightly remarks," Exaggeratio est in interrogatione." The question suggests answers too awful for words. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a></div><div class="verse">And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And if the righteous scarcely be saved.</span> St. Peter is quoting the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>. That version departs considerably from the Hebrew, which is accurately represented by the Authorized Version, "Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner." Probably the word rendered" recompensed," which is neutral in its meaning, is best understood here, not of the good deeds of the righteous, but of the sin which still cleaves to all human righteousness. The righteous shall be requited in the earth, that is, chastised for his transgressions. So it would be now, St. Peter says; judgment must begin at the house of God. He adopts the inexact Septuagint translation for its substantial truth, as we now sometimes use versions which are sufficient for practical purposes, though we know them to be critically inaccurate. We observe again the absence of marks of quotation, as often in St. Peter. Bengel well remarks that the awful "scarcely" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is softened by <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>. Where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? The" ungodly "are the impious, scoffers, and blasphemers; the" sinners" are men of profligate and dissolute lives. But the words are (probably) included under one article in the Greek; the men were the same; one form of evil led to the other (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>; see also <a href="../../par/matthew/19-25.htm">Matthew 19:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/4-19.htm">1 Peter 4:19</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls <i>to him</i> in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God</span>; rather, <span class="accented">let them also that suffer.</span> St. Peter sums up his exhortation; he returns to the thought of <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-17.htm">1 Peter 3:17</a>, "It is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing." In the hour of suffering, as well as in times of prosperity, we are in the hands of a merciful and loving Father; we are to learn submission, not because the suffering is inevitable, but because it is according to his will, and his will is our sanctification and salvation. Commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">commit their souls in well-doing unto a faithful Creator.</span> The conjunction "as" must be omitted, not being found in any of the best manuscripts. The word rendered "Creator" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) Occurs nowhere else in the Greek Testament. <span class="cmt_word">God is our Creator, the Father of spirits, He gave the spirit; to him it returneth</span>. We must imitate our dying Lord, and, like him, commit our souls to the keeping of our heavenly Father as a deposit which may be left with perfect confidence in the hands of a faithful Creator (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-12.htm">2 Timothy 1:12</a>). There is an evident reference here to our Lord's words upon the cross (<a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/31-5.htm">Psalm 31:5</a>). St. Peter adds, "in well-doing." The Christian's faith must bring forth the fruits of holy living; even in the midst of suffering he must "be careful to maintain good works." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_peter/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Peter 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Peter 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_peter/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Peter 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Peter 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_peter/5.htm"><title>1 Peter 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_peter/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_peter/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_peter/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_peter/4.htm" title="1 Peter 4">&#9668;</a> 1 Peter 5 <a href="../2_peter/1.htm" title="2 Peter 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-1.htm">1 Peter 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders which are among you I exhort.</span> The Vatican and Alexandrine Manuscripts omit the article, and insert "therefore" (the Sinaitic gives both), reading, "Elders, therefore, among you I exhort." The solemn thoughts of the last chapter, the coming judgment, the approach of persecution, the necessity of perseverance in well-doing, suggest the exhortation; hence the "therefore." The context shows that the apostle is using the word "elder" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter) in its official sense, though its original meaning was also in his thoughts, as appears by ver. 5. We first meet with the word in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-4.htm">Joshua 20:4</a>, etc.). Used originally with reference to age, it soon became a designation of office. Very early in the history of the Christian Church we meet with the same title. It occurs first in <a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. The Christians of Antioch make a collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, and send their alms by the hand of Barnabas and Saul to the elders of the Jerusalem Church. We read several times of these elders in Acts xv. as associated with the apostles in the consideration of the great question of the circumcision of Gentile Christians; they joined with St. James in the official reception of St. Paul at his last visit to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). It appears, then, that the Christian presbyterate originated in the mother Church of Jerusalem. It was soon introduced into the daughter Churches; the apostles Paul and Barnabas ordained elders in every Church during the first missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>); and the various notices scattered over the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles imply the early establishment of the office throughout the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Who am also an elder</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. St. Peter, though holding the very highest rank in the Church as an apostle of Christ, one of those who were to sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>), claims no supremacy; he simply designates himself as a brother presbyter. So also St. John (<a href="../../par/2_john/1.htm">2 John 1</a>; <a href="../../par/3_john/1.htm">3 John 1</a>). He exhorts the presbyters as a brother, and grounds his exhortation on community of office. The absence of any note of distinction between bishops and presbyters is, so far, an indication of the early date of this Epistle, as against Hilgenfeld and others. <span class="cmt_word">And a witness of the sufferings of Christ.</span> This was his one distinction above those whom he addresses. Like St. John, he declared unto them that which he had heard, which he had seen with his eyes. He had seen the Lord bound and delivered into the hands of wicked men; probably he had watched his last sufferings among them which stood afar off. <span class="cmt_word">And also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.</span> The thought of the sufferings of Christ leads on to the thought of the future glory (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>). Perhaps St. Peter was also thinking of the Lord's promise to himself, "Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards" (<a href="../../par/john/13-36.htm">John 13:36</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight <i>thereof</i>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Feed the flock of God which is among you</span>; rather, <span class="accented">tend</span>, as a shepherd tends his flock. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is aorist, as if St. Peter wished to concentrate into one point of view all the labors of the ministerial life. He is echoing the word so solemnly addressed to himself by the risen Lord, "Feed my sheep <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>." The word covers all the various duties of the pastoral office: "Pasce mente, pasce ore, pasce operc, pasce animi oratione, verbi exhortatione, exempli exhibitione" (St. Bernard, quoted by Alford). St. Peter lays stress upon the solemn fact that the flock belongs to God, not to the shepherds (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>). Some understand the words rendered "which is among you <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> " as meaning" quantum in vobis est," "<span class="accented">as</span> far as lies in your power." Others as "<span class="accented">that</span> which is committed to you," or "that which is placed under your care." But the simple local meaning seems the best. <span class="cmt_word">Taking the oversight thereof.</span> This word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is not found in the Sinaitic and Vatican Manuscripts.

It shows that when this Epistle was written, the words <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, presbyter and bishop, were still synonymous (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17</a> and 28 in the Greek; also <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> and 7). <span class="cmt_word">Not by constraint, but willingly</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, by constraint, occurs only here. St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>), "Necessity is laid upon me;" but that was an inward necessity, the constraining love of Christ. Bede, quoted by Alford, <span class="accented">says</span>, "Coacte pascit gregem, qui propter rerum temporalium penurium non habens unde vivat, idcirco praedicat evangelium ut de evangelio vivere possit." Some good manuscripts add, after "willingly," the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "according to God," i.e. according to his will (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-27.htm">Romans 8:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not for filthy lucre.</span> The adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here (for the thought, comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>). It would seem that, even in the apostolic age, there were sometimes such opportunities of gain (see <a href="../../par/titus/1-11.htm">Titus 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) as to be a temptation to enter the ministry for the sake of money.

The Authorized Version, following Beza, supplies <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "God's heritage." But if this were the apostle's meaning, he would surely have used the singular, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the lot or portion of God;" and it is very unlikely that he would have left the most important word to be supplied. Some commentators take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> in its modern sense, of the clergy, as if St. Peter was commanding the bishops not to tyrannize over the inferior clergy. But this view involves an anachronism; the word had not acquired this meaning in St. Peter's time. It is clearly best to understand it of the lots or portions assigned to individual presbyters. The word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> originally meant a "lot" (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-35.htm">Matthew 27:35</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>), then portions assigned by casting lots, as the possessions of the tribes of Israel (<a href="../../par/joshua/18.htm">Joshua 18</a> and 19), then any portion or inheritance however obtained; thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a> the Lord is said to be the Inheritance <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of the Levites. In later times the word was applied to the clergy, who were regarded as, in a special sense, the Lord's portion or inheritance, perhaps because God was pleased to take the tribe of Levi instead of the firstborn, saying, the Levites shall be mine (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But being ensamples to the flock</span>; literally, <span class="accented">becoming examples</span>. They must imitate the great Example, the Lord Jesus, and, by gradual imitation of his blessed character, become examples themselves. Thus they will acquire a more salutary influence and a truer authority. "The life should command, and the tongue persuade" (Athanasius, quoted by Fronmuller).

This is the true reward of the faithful presbyter, not power or filthy lucre. Literally, it is "the crown of glory," the promised glory, the glory of the Lord which he hath promised to his chosen. "The glory which thou gavest me, I have given them" (<a href="../../par/john/17-22.htm">John 17:22</a>). The crown is the glory; the genitive seems to be one of apposition. The Greek word here rendered "that fadeth not away" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is not exactly the same with that so rendered in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a> <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x3a7;&#x3a7;</span>; taken literally, the words used here mean an amaranthine wreath - a wreath of amaranth flowers; the general meaning remains the same, "unfading." St. Peter is thinking, not of a kingly crown, but of the wreaths worn on festive occasions or bestowed on conquerors. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all <i>of you</i> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder</span>. Is St. Peter still using the last word in its official sense? or is he passing to its ordinary meaning? It seems impossible to answer the question with certainty. Some think that the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, younger, had also acquired an official meaning, and that it is used here, and in <a href="../../par/acts/5-6.htm">Acts 5:6</a> of assistant-ministers who were employed to help the presbyters and apostles. Others think that it had a meaning nearly equivalent to our "laity" as distinguished from the presbyters. But, on the whole, it seems more natural to suppose that the word "elder," when once used, led St. Peter on from one meaning to another, and that here he is simply speaking of the respect due to age (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, all of you be subject one to another.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, rendered "be subject," is omitted in the most ancient manuscripts. If their reading is adopted, the dative, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">one</span> to another," may be taken either with the previous clause," Submit yourselves unto the elder; yea, all of you, to one another;" or with that which follows, "<span class="accented">Be</span> clothed with humility one towards another." <span class="cmt_word">And be clothed with humility.</span> The word rendered "be clothed" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> occurs here only, and is a remarkable word. It is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a knot or band; the corresponding noun. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, was the name of an apron worn by slaves, which was tied round them when at work, to keep their dress clean. The word seems to teach that humility is a garment which must be firmly fastened on and bound closely round us. The association of the slave's apron seems also to suggest that Christians should be ready to submit to the humblest works of charity for others, and to point back to the lowliness of the Lord Jesus, when he girded himself, and  washed the feet of his apostles (<a href="../../par/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4</a>). It may be noticed that the Greek word for "humility" <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> is used only by St. Paul, except in this place. <span class="cmt_word">For God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</span> St. Peter is quoting from the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, without marks of quotation, as in other places. St. James quotes the same passage (<a href="../../par/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>), and with the same variation, substituting "God" for "Lord," as St. Peter does. The Greek word for "resisteth <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is a strong one: God rangeth himself as with an army against the haughty.

St. Peter is quoting, with slight alterations, the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>. We cast our anxiety upon God when we fulfill the Lord's commandment, "Take no thought [rather, 'be not anxious'], saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? For your heavenly Fat. her knoweth that ye have need of all these things." God cares for us; therefore we must not be over-anxious, but trust in him. The participle is aorist, as if implying that we are to cast the whole burden of all our anxieties <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> by one act of faith upon the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">For he careth for you</span>. The Greek word is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, quite different from the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> of the foregoing clause. The care which is forbidden is that anxiety about worldly things which harasses a man and distracts his mind, so that he cannot compose himself to prayer and holy meditation. God's care for us is calm, holy, thoughtful providence. He "knoweth that we have need of all these things;" and he maketh all things work together for good to his chosen, to them that love him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be sober, be vigilant</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>). For the first word, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, see note on 1 Peter 4:7. The second <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is the word so often and so emphatically used by our Lord (<a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40, 41</a>, etc.). The imperatives are aorist, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-7.htm">1 Peter 4:7</a>; and, as there, either imply that the exhortation was needed by the readers, or are used to express vividly the necessity of instant attention. <span class="cmt_word">Because your adversary the devil.</span> The conjunction "because" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The asyndeten, as in the last clause, increases the emphasis. The word rendered "adversary" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means properly an opponent in a lawsuit, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>; but it is also used generally for "adversary," and so is a translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Satan</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, devil, means "slanderer," "false accuser." <span class="cmt_word">As a roaring lion</span>. He is called a serpent to denote his subtlety, a lion to express his fierceness and strength. The word rendered "roaring" <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used especially of the cries of wild beasts when ravenous with hunger (see <a href="../../par/psalms/104-21.htm">Psalm 104:21</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/22-13.htm">Psalm 22:13, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Walketh about, seeking whom he may devour</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-2.htm">Job 2:2</a>). The words express the restless energy of the wicked one. He cannot touch those who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation; but he walketh about, looking eagerly after any lost sheep that may have wandered from the fold. He roars in the craving of his heart for prey, like a hungry lion, seeking whom he may devour, or (for the reading here is somewhat uncertain) to devour some one, or simply to devour. The Greek word means literally "to drink down;" it implies utter destruction. It is the word in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-54.htm">1 Corinthians 15:54</a>, "Death is swallowed up <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in victory." Satan now seeks whom he may destroy: "The Lord will destroy him that hath the power of death, that is, the devil" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whom resist steadfast in the faith</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>, where the same word, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, is used; the close resemblance seems to indicate St. Peter's knowledge of the Epistle of St. James; comp. also St. Paul in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>, etc. The Greek word for "steadfast" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is emphatic; it implies solidity, rocklike firmness. Only faith can give that steadfastness - faith in Christ, the one Foundation, the Rock on which the Christian's house is built. Faith here is trustfulness rather than objective truth. Therefore the rendering of the Revised Version seems preferable, "in your faith," the article having, as often, a possessive meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the same</span> (<span class="accented">forms</span>) <span class="accented">of afflictions</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> unusual construction with the pronoun, though common with adjectives, intended to give emphasis; the sufferings were the very same. The infinitive is present; it should therefore be rendered, "are being accomplished." The persecutions were now beginning to break out. The word for "brethren" is the collective, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1fef;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, brotherhood, which we met with in <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>. The dative is that of reference -  "in" or "for"  the brotherhood. (For the words, "in the world," comp. <a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>, "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.") There is another way of taking the clause. The unusual construction (in the Greek Testament) of the accusative and infinitive, which, indeed, occurs nowhere else with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, has led Herman and others to take the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as middle, and to connect the dative, "<span class="accented">for</span> the brotherhood," with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, the same. Thus the translation will be, "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> how to pay the same tribute of affliction as your brethren in the world." This seems forced and unnecessary. Huther gives another possible translation, which he thinks preferable to all others: "<span class="accented">Knowing</span> [or better rather, 'considering'] that the same sufferings are accomplishing themselves in the brethren."

St. Peter has finished his exhortations; he has told his readers what they must do; he now bids them look to God, and tells them where they will find strength. God will work within them both to will and to do of his good pleasure; for he is the God of all grace. All that grace by which we are saved, without which we can do nothing, comes from him as its Author and Source. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus</span>; rather, <span class="accented">who called you</span>... <span class="accented">in Christ Jesus</span>. All the best manuscripts read "you" instead of us. Two of the most ancient omit "Jesus" here. God called us "in Christ;" that is, through spiritual union with Christ; the glory is promised to these who are one with Christ; for the glory is Christ's, and his members will share it. The very end and purpose of our calling was that we might inherit that glory. This is the apostle's great topic of consolation. <span class="cmt_word">After that ye have suffered a while</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a little</span>. The word may refer to the degree, as well as to the duration, of the sufferings. They are transient; the glory is eternal. They may seem very severe, but they are light in comparison with that "far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." <span class="cmt_word">Make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</span> The manuscripts vary between the future and the optative in these four verbs; the preponderance of evidence seems in favor of the future. The emphatic pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must not be omitted. Translate therefore, "shall himself make you perfect." He only can "perfect what is lacking in our faith" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a>, where the same verb is used); and he will do it.

Silvanus was the bearer of the Epistle; he may have been the amanuensis also. In all probability he is the Silas of the Acts of the Apostles, and the Silvanus whose name St. Paul associates with his own in the address of both Epistles to the Thessalonians; he is mentioned also in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-19.htm">2 Corinthians 1:19</a>. As the companion of St. Paul, he must have been known to the Churches of Asia Minor. The word rendered in the Authorized Version "I suppose" <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> does not imply any doubt (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). The Christians of Asia Minor knew Silvanus as a faithful brother; St. Peter adds his testimony. Some connect it with the clause, "<span class="accented">I</span> have written unto you briefly," as if St. Peter meant to say that he regarded his letter as a short one, the subjects being so important; but this does not seem natural. It is better to take the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, unto you, with the verb "I have written," than with the words, "a faithful brother," as in the Authorized Version. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is the epistolary aorist,  and may therefore be rendered "I write." <span class="cmt_word">Exhorting, and testifying</span>. The general tone of this Epistle is hortatory: St. Peter comforts his readers in the sufferings which were coming on them, and exhorts them to patient endurance. The word rendered "testifying" <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament. Bengel and others take the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">insuper</span>, in "addition:" "Petrus insuper testatur;" he adds his testimony to that of Paul and others who have gone before; or, he not only exhorts, he also testifies - the testimony is in addition to the exhortation. But more probably the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> is intensive, or expresses simply the direction of the testifying (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:40, where the same words nearly; the Greek for "testified" is <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> are used in describing St. Peter's exhortations). <span class="cmt_word">That this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand</span>; rather, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein</span>. The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is supported by the oldest manuscripts. The construction involves a common ellipse, "Into which (having entered) stand fast." Some think that it was St. Peter's intention in these words to set the seal of his apostolic authority upon the truth of the teaching which the Christians of Asia Minor had received from St. Paul. It may be so. The whole Epistle corroborates the teaching of St. Paul, and shows St. Peter's exact agreement with it. But it seems probable that, if St. Peter had thought it necessary to give a formal sanction to St. Paul's preaching, he would have done so plainly, as he does at the end of the Second Epistle. Again, there are no traces in the Epistle of any doubts now existing in the minds of the Asiatic Christians, or of any opposition to St. Paul, such as there once had been in the Churches of Corinth and Galatia. And St. Peter does not say, "These are the true doctrines," but "This is the true grace of God." He seems rather to be giving the testimony o&pound; his knowledge and spiritual experience to the fact that the grace which they had received came indeed from God, that it was his true grace, that it was he who was working within them both to will and to do. They must stand fast in that grace, and by its help work out their own salvation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">The <i>church that is</i> at Babylon, elected together with <i>you</i>, saluteth you; and <i>so doth</i> Marcus my son.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the co-elect in Babylon</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;</span>. The word "Church" is given in no manuscripts with the remarkable exception of the Sinaitic; the rest have simply "the co-elect." We ask - What word is to be supplied, "Church" or "sister"? Some think that St, Peter's wife (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-14.htm">Matthew 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>) is intended, or some other well-known Christian woman (comp. <a href="../../par/2_john/1.htm">2 John 1</a>). In favor of this view is the following salutation from Marcus. It is more natural to join together the names of two persons than to couple a Church with an individual. Also it scorns exceedingly improbable that such a word as "Church" should be omitted (a word, we may remark, which occurs nowhere in St. Peter's Epistles), and the ellipse left to be filled up by the readers. On the other hand, it is said to be unlikely that a humble Galilaean woman should be described as "the co-elect in Babylon." This argument would have considerable weight if the apostle were writing from large and well-known Church, like that at Rome; but it is quite possible that "the co-elect" might be the only Christian woman, or the one best known among a very small number in Babylon. On the whole, it seems most probable to us that by "the co-elect" (whether we supply "together with you" or "with me") is meant a Christian woman known at least by name to the Churches of Asia Miner, and therefore very possibly St. Peter's wife, who, St. Paul tells us, was his companion in travel. The question now meets us - Is "Babylon" to be taken in a mystic sense, as a cryptograph for Rome, or literally? Eusebius, and ancient writers generally, understand it of Rome. Eusebius is commonly understood to claim for this view the authority of Papias and Clement of Alexandria (as has been stated in the Introduction, p. 9.). But the historian's words ('Hist. Eccl.,' 1. 15. 2) seem to claim that authority only for the connection of St. Peter with St. Mark's Gospel; the identification of Babylon with Rome seems to be mentioned only as a common opinion in the time of Eusebius. It is said that there is n o trace o f the existence of a Christian Church at the Chaldean Babylon, and no proof, apart from this passage, that St. Peter was ever there. There had been a great Jewish colony at Babylon, but it had been destroyed in the time of Caligula. In answer to these arguments, it may be urged that the cryptograph of Babylon for Rome would probably not be understood; even if we assume the earliest date assigned to the Apocalypse, that book could scarcely be known very generally in Asia Minor when this Epistle was written. St. Peter at Babylon, like St. Paul at Athens, may have met with little success; the infant Church may have been quickly crushed. There may have been a second settlement of Jews at Babylon between A.D.  and the date of this Epistle. But it is quite possible that St. Peter may have been working as a missionary among the Babylonian Gentiles, for we cannot believe that he confined his ministrations to the Jews. On the whole, it seems much more probable that St. Peter was writing at the famous city on the Euphrates, though no traces of his work there remain, than that he should have used this one word in a mystical sense at the end of an Epistle where all else is plain and simple (see this question discussed in the Introduction, p. 9.). <span class="cmt_word">And so doth Marcus my son</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the word used by St. Paul of spiritual relationship (see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>). St. Peter has <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> here. Still, it seems most probable that Marcus, mentioned as he is without any further description, is not a son of the apostle after the flesh, but the well-known John Mark of the Acts (see Introduction, p. 8.).

The practice seems to have been universal in early times; it is mentioned by Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Chrysostom, Augustine, and other ancient writers (see Bingham's 'Antiquities,' 15. 3. 3). It is now used only in the Coptic Church of Egypt. Rites and ceremonies may be changed "according to the diversities of countries, times, and men's manners;" the sacred duty of brotherly love remains unchanged forever. <span class="cmt_word">Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</span> The most ancient manuscripts omit the word "Jesus" here and the "Amen? St. Paul's blessing at the end of his Epistles is usually "grace" (in the Epistle to the Ephesians he adds "peace"). St. Peter ends his Epistle with the benediction which he had so often heard from the Savior's lips. That blessed gift of peace is granted to all who are "in Christ," who is our Peace (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_peter/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Peter 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Peter 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_peter/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Peter 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Peter 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
