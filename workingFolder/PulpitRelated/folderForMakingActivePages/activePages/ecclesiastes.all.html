It is like the apostle's warning to his converts, "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>). The Hebrew expression is literally, "flies of death," which may mean either "dead flies," as in our version and the Vulgate (<span class="accented">muses morientes</span>), or "deadly, poisonous flies," as in the Septuagint (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The latter rendering seems preferable, if we regard the use of similar compound phrases, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, "instruments of death" (<a href="../../par/psalms/7-14.htm">Psalm 7:14</a>: [13]); "snares of death" (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5</a>); and in New Testament Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "the death-stroke" (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-3.htm">Revelation 13:3, 12</a>). The flies meant are such as are poisonous in their bite, or carry infection with them. Such insects corrupt anything which they touch - food, ointment, whether they perish where they alight or not. They, as the Hebrew says, <span class="accented">make to stink, make to ferment, the oil of the perfumer</span>. The singular verb is here used with the plural subject to express the unity of the individuals, "flies" forming one complete idea. The Septuagint rendering omits one of the verbs: <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Corrupt a preparation of sweet ointment." The point, of course, is the comparative insignificance of the cause which spoils a costly substance compounded with care and skill. Thus little faults mar great characters and reputations. "A good name is better than precious ointment" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>), but a good name is ruined by follies, and then it stinks in men's nostrils. The term, "ointment of the apothecary," is used by Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>, etc.) in describing the holy chrism which was reserved for special occasions. So doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor. The meaning of the Authorized Version is tolerably correct, but the actual rendering will hardly stand, and one wants some verb to govern "him that," etc. The other versions vary. Septuagint, "A little wisdom is more precious (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) than great glory of folly;" Vulgate, "More precious are wisdom and glory than small and short-lived folly;" Jerome, "Precious above wisdom and glory is a little folly." This last interpretation proceeds upon the idea that such "folly" is at any rate free from pride, and has few glaring faults. "Dulce est desipere in loco," says Horace ('Carm.,' 4:12. 28). But the original is best translated thus: "More weighty than wisdom, than honor, is a little folly." It is a painful fact that a little folly, one foolish act, one silly peculiarity of manner or disposition, will suffice to impair the real value of a matt's wisdom and the estimation in which he was held. The little clement of foolishness, like the little insect in the ointment, obscures the real excellence of the man, and deprives him of the honor that is really his due. And in religion we know that one fault unchecked, one Secret sin cherished, poisons the whole character, makes a man lose the grace of God. (For the same effect from another cause, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-13.htm">Ezekiel 33:13</a>.) Jerome sees in the "dead flies" wicked thoughts put into the Christian's mind by Beelzebub, "the lord of flies." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">A wise man's heart <i>is</i> at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - A tetrastich contrasting wisdom and folly. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.</span> There is here no reference to the classical use of right and left, as ominous of success and disaster, which is never found in the Old Testament. The right hand is the place of honor, the left of inferiority, as a matter of fact, not of superstition and luck. The symbolism is intimated in Christ's account of the judgment (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.). But in the present passage we should best paraphrase - The wise man's heart, his understanding and sentiments, lead him to what is right and proper and straightforward; the fool's heart leads him astray, in the wrong direction. The former is active and skilful, the latter is slow and awkward. One, we may say, has no left hand, the other has no right. To be at the right hand is to be ready to help and guard. "The Lord is at thy right band," to protect thee, <span class="accented">says</span> the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-5.htm">Psalm 110:5</a>). The wise <span class="accented">man's</span> mind shows him how to escape dangers and direct his course safely; the fool's mind helps him not to any good pur<span class="accented">pose</span>, causes him to err and miss his best object.

If he remained at home he might keep his real ineptitude concealed; but such persons as he are unconscious of their inanity, and take no pains to hide it; they go where, they act as, their foolish heart prompts them. There is no metaphor here, nor any reference to the fool being put in the right path and perversely turning away. It is simply, as the Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="cmt_word">His wisdom</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">heart</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>faileth him</span>. Ginsburg and others render, <span class="accented">"He</span> lacketh his <span class="accented">mind,"</span> want of heart being continually taken in the Book of Proverbs as equivalent to deficiency of understanding (<a href="../../par/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7</a>, etc.). But Delitzsch and Wright consider the order of the words and the suffix to be against this view, and they translate as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his understanding is at fault. <span class="cmt_word">And he saith to every one that he is a fool.</span> The sentence is ambiguous, and capable of two interpretations. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Cumipse insipiens sit, omnes stultos aestimat</span>. Jerome quotes Symmachus as rendering, "He suspects all men that they are fools." According to this view, the fool in his conceit thinks that every one he meets is a fool, says this in his mind, like the sluggard in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-16.htm">Proverbs 26:16</a>, "Who is wiser in his own conceit than ten men that can render a reason." Another explanation, more closely in accordance with the foregoing clauses, takes the pronoun in "he is a fool" to refer to the man himself, <span class="accented">se</span> <span class="accented">esse stultum</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9</a>:21 [20], "Let the nations know themselves to be but men"). As soon as he goes abroad, his words and actions display his real character; he betrays himself; he says virtually to all with whom he has to do, "I am a fool" (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-16.htm">Proverbs 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-2.htm">Proverbs 18:2</a>). It is hard to say to which interpretation the Septuagint inclines, giving, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, "And all that he will think is folly." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-7.</span> - Section 12. <span class="accented">Illustration of the conduct of wisdom under capricious rulers</span>, or when fools are exalted to high stations. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee</span>. "Spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) is here equivalent to "anger," as <a href="../../par/judges/8-3.htm">Judges 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/29-11.htm">Proverbs 29:11</a>. The idea seems to be that a statesman or councilor gives wise advice to a monarch, which the latter takes in bad part, and shows strong resentment against the person who offered it. Now, when a man knows himself to be in the right, and yet finds his counsel rejected, perhaps with scorn and reproach added, he is naturally prone to feel sore, and to show by some overt act his sense of the ill treatment which he has received. But what says wisdom? <span class="cmt_word">Leave not thy place</span> (<span class="accented">makom</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> position, pest, office. Do not hastily resign the situation at court to which you have been appointed. Some, not so suitably, take the expression, "leave thy place," figuratively, as equivalent to "give way to anger, renounce the temper which becomes you, lose your self-possession." But Wright, from the analogous use of <span class="accented">matstsale</span> and <span class="accented">maamad</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>, confirms the interpretation which we have adopted. Compare the advice in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a>, where, however, the idea is rather of open rebellion than of a resentment which shows itself by withdrawal. Origen ('De Princip.,' 3:2) explained "the spirit of the ruler" to be the evil spirit; and Gregory, commenting on this passage, writes ('Moral.,' 3:43), "As though he had said in plain words, 'If thou perceivest the spirit of the tempter to prevail against thee in aught, quit not the lowliness of penitence;' and that it was the abasement of penitence that he called 'our place,' he shows by the words that follow, 'for healing [Vulgate] pacifieth great offences.' For what else is the humility of mourning, save the remedy of sin?" (Oxford transl.). <span class="cmt_word">For yielding pacifieth great offenses</span>. <span class="accented">Marpe</span>, "yielding," is rendered "healing" by the versions. Thus <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">euratio</span> (Vulgate). But this translation is not so suitable as that of Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "moderation." The word is used in the sense of" gentleness," "meekness," in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>; and the gnome expresses the truth that a calm, conciliating spirit, not prone to take offence, but patient under trying circumstances, obviates great sins. The sins are those of the subject. This quiet resignation saves him from conspiracy, rebellion, treason, etc., into which his untempered resentment might hurry him. We may compare <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> and Proverbs 25:15; and Horace, 'Cam.,' 3. 3, "Justum et tenacem propositi virum," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The man whose soul is firm and strong,<br />Bows not to any tyrant's frown,<br />And on the rabble's clamorous throng<br />In proud disdain looks coldly down."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) They who regard the "offenses" as those of the ruler explain them to mean oppression and injustice; but it seems plain from the run of the sentence that the minister, not the monarch, is primarily in the mind of the writer, though, of course, it is quite true that the submission of the former might save the ruler from the commission of some wrong. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">There is an evil <i>which</i> I have seen under the sun, as an error <i>which</i> proceedeth from the ruler:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - Koheleth gives his personal experience of apparent confusion in the ordering of state affairs. <span class="cmt_word">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun.</span> Power gets into the hands of an unwise man, and then errors are committed and injustice reigns. <span class="cmt_word">As an error which proceedeth from the ruler.</span> The <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> here is <span class="accented">cash veritatis</span>, which denotes not comparison, but resemblance, the idealization of the individual, the harmony of the particular with the general idea. The evil which he noticed appeared to be (he does not affirm that it is) a mistake caused by the ruler; it so presented itself to his mind. The caution observed in the statement may be owing partly to the tacit feeling that such blots occasioned difficulties in the view taken of the moral government of the world. He does not intend to refer to God under the appellation "Ruler." The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "As if it came involuntarily;" Vulgate, to much the same effect, <span class="accented">Quasi per errorem egrediens</span>. The idea here is either gnat the evil is one not produced by any intentional action of the ruler, but resulting from human imperfection, or that what appears to be a mistake is not so really. But these interpretations are unsuitable. Those who adhere to the Solomonic authorship of our book see here a prophetic intimation of the evil of Jeroboam's rule, which evil proceeded from the sins of Solomon himself and his son Rehoboam. (So Wordsworth, Motais, etc.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place</span>. This is an instance of the error intimated in the preceding verse. A tyrannical ruler exalts incompetent persons, unworthy favorites, to "great heights" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, Septuagint), as it is literally - puts them into eminent positions. "Folly" is abstract for concrete, "fools." <span class="accented">And the rich sit in low place</span>. "The rich" (<span class="accented">ushirim</span>) are not simply those who have wealth, however obtained, but men of noble birth; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as Plumptre appositely notes, persons of ancestral wealth, who from natural position might be looked upon as rulers of men. Such men would seek eminent stations, not from base motives of gain, but from an honorable ambition, and yet they are often slighted by unworthy princes and kept in low estate (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/19-10.htm">Proverbs 19:10</a>; Ecclus. 11:5, 6). The experience mentioned in this and the following verses could scarcely have been Solomon's, though it has been always common enough in the East, where the most startling changes have been made, the lowest persons have been suddenly raised to eminence, mistresses and favorites loaded with dignities, and oppression of the rich has been systematically pursued.

Such an allusion could not have been made in Solomon's reign, when the importation of horses was quite a new thing (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>). Later, to ride upon horses was a distinction of the nobility (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>). Thus Amaziah's corpse was brought on horses to be buried in the city of David (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-28.htm">2 Chronicles 25:28</a>): Mordecai was honored by being taken round the city on the king's own steed (<a href="../../par/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Princes walking as servants upon the earth</span>. "Princes" (<span class="accented">sarim</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> masters, lords. Some take the expressions here as figurative, equivalent to "those who are worthy to be princes," and "those who are fit only to be slaves;" but the literal is the true interpretation. Commentators quote what Justin (41:3) says of the Parthians, "Hoc denique discrimen inter serves liberos-que, quod servi pedibus, Liberi non nisi equis iuccdunt." Ginsburg notes that early travelers in the East record the fact that Europeans were not allowed by the Turks to ride upon horses, but were compelled either to use asses or walk on foot. In some places the privilege of riding upon horseback was permitted to the consuls of the great powers - an honor denied to all strangers of lower degree. Among the Greeks and Romans the possession of a horse with its war-trappings implied a certain amount of wealth and distinction. St. Gregory, treating of this passage ('Moral.,' 31:43), says, "By the name <span class="accented">horse</span> is understood temporal dignity, as Solomon witnesses .... For every one who sins is the servant of sin, and servants are upon horses, when sinner's are elated with the dignities of the present life. But princes walk as servants, when no honor exalts many who are full of the dignity of virtues, but when the greatest misfortune here presses them down, as though unworthy." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - Section 13. <span class="accented">Various proverbs expressing the benefit of prudence and caution, and the danger of folly</span>. The connection with what has preceded is not closely marked, but is probably to be found in the bearing of the maxims on the conduct of the wise man who has incurred the resentment of a ruler, and might be inclined to disaffection and revolt. They are intentionally obscure and capable of a double sense - a necessary precaution if the writer lived under Persian despots.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it.</span> This proverb occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>, and, as expressive of the retribution that awaits evil-doers, finds parallels in <a href="../../par/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/10-2.htm">Psalm 10:2</a>; Ecclus. 27:25, 26.

But the scope of our passage is rather to speak of what may possibly occur than to insist on the Nemesis that inevitably overtakes transgressors. Its object is to inspire caution in the prosecution of dangerous undertakings, whether the enterprise be the overthrow of a tyrant, or any other action of importance, or whether, as some suppose, the arraignment of the providential ordering of events is intended, in which ease there would be the danger of blasphemy and impatience. <span class="cmt_word">And whoso breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him</span>. The futures throughout vers. 8 and 9 are not intended to express certainty, as if the results mentioned were inevitable, but rather possibility, and might be rendered, with Delitzsch, "may fall," "may bite," etc. The "hedge" is rather a wall (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-31.htm">Proverbs 24:31</a>), in the crevices of which poisonous snakes have made their abode, which are disturbed by its demolition (comp. Ames 5:19). <span class="accented">Nachash</span>, here used, is the generic name of any serpent. The majority of the snakes found in Palestine are harmless; but there are some which are very deadly, especially the cobra and those which belong to the viper family. There is no allusion here to the illegal removal of landmarks, a proceeding which might be supposed to provoke retribution; the hedge or wail is one which the demolisher is justified in removing, only in doing so he must look out for certain contingencies, and guard against them. Metaphorically, the pulling down a wall may refer to the removal of evil institutions in a state, which involves the reformer in many difficulties and perils.

The dangers to which such laborers are exposed are well known. Here, again, but unsuccessfully, some have seen a reference to the removal of landmarks, comparing <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>, where the word is translated "set aside." As before said, the paragraph does not speak of retribution, but advises caution, enforcing the lesson by certain homely, allusions to the accidents that may occur m customary occupations. <span class="cmt_word">He that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</span> Cutting up logs of wood, a man may hurt himself with axe or saw, or be injured by splinters, etc. If we take the idea to be the felling of trees, there is the danger of being crushed in their fall, or, according to the tenor of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>, of being killed inadvertently by a neighbor's axe. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui scindit ligna vulnerabitur ab eis</span>, which is more definite than the general term "endangered;" but the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the Authorized Version. Plumptre sees here, again, an intimation of the danger of attacking time-honored institutions, even when decaying and corrupt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:10</a></div><div class="verse">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom <i>is</i> profitable to direct.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge</span>. The illustration at the end of the last verse is continued. The "iron" is the axe used in cutting wood; if this be blunted by the work to which it is put, and he, the laborer, has not sharpened the edge (Hebrew, <span class="accented">the face</span>, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>), what is the consequence? How is he to carry on his work? <span class="cmt_word">Then must he put to more strength</span>. He must put more force in his blows, he must make up for the want of edge by added power and weight. This is the simplest explanation of the passage, which contains many linguistic difficulties. These may be seen discussed at length in the commentaries of Delitzsch, Wright, Nowack, etc. The translation of Ginsburg is not commendable, "If the axe be blunt, and he (the tyrant's opponent)do not sharpen it beforehand (<span class="accented">phanim</span>, taken as an adverb of time), he (the tyrant) shall only increase the army."

Wisdom teaches how to conduct matters to a successful termination; for instance, it prompts the worker to sharpen his tool instead of trying to accomplish his task by an exertion of mere brute strength. The gnome applies to all the instances which have been mentioned above. Wisdom alone enables a man to meet and overcome the dangers and difficulties which beset his social, common, and political life. If we apply the whole sentence to the case of disaffection with the government or open rebellion, the caution given would signify  - See that your means are adequate to the end, that your resources are sufficient to conduct your enterprise to success.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The last proverb of this little series shows the necessity of seizing the right opportunity. <span class="cmt_word">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment.</span> The Authorized Version is not quite correct. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span>, with which the verse begins, is here conditional, and the rendering should be, <span class="accented">If the serpent bite</span>, etc.; the apodosis comes in the next clause. The idea is taken up from ver. 8. If one handles a serpent without due precaution or without knowing the secret of charming it, one will suffer for it. The taming and charming of poisonous snakes is still, as heretofore, practiced in Egypt and the East. What the secret of this power is has not been accurately determined; whether it belongs especially to persons of a certain idiosyncrasy, whether it is connected with certain words or intonations of the voice or musical sounds, we do not know. Of the existence of the power from remote antiquity there can be no question. Allusions to it in Scripture are common enough (see <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-5.htm">Psalm 58:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-17.htm">Jeremiah 8:17</a>; Ecclus. 12:13). If a serpent before it is charmed is dangerous, what then? The Authorized Version affords no sensible apodosis: <span class="cmt_word">And a babbler is no better</span>. The words rendered "babbler" (<span class="accented">baul hallashon</span>) are literally "master of the tongue," and by them is meant the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "the serpent-charmer." The clause should <span class="accented">run, Then there is no use in the charmer</span>. If the man is bitten before he has time to use his charm, it is no profit to him that he has the secret, it is too late to employ it when the mischief is done. This is to shut the stable door after the steed is stolen. The maxim enforces the warning against being too late; the greatest skill is useless unless applied at the right moment. The Septuagint translates virtually as above, "If a serpent bites when not charmed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>), then there is no advantage to the charmer (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1fb4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>)." The Vulgate departs from the context, rendering, <span class="accented">Si mordeat serpens in silentio</span> (i.e. probably "uncharmed"), <span class="accented">nihil eo minus habet qui occulte detrahit</span>, "He is nothing better who slanders secretly," which St. Jerome thus explains: the serpent and the slanderer are alike, for as the serpent stealthily infuses its poison, so the secret slanderer pours his venom into another's breast.

In distinction from the unready man, who, like the snake-charmer in the preceding verse, suffers-by reason of his untimely silence, the wise man uses his speech opportunely and to good purpose. (A different result is given in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</span> This is a stronger ex-prosaic, than "ruin" or "destroy."

A confirmation of the last clause of the preceding verse. The fool speaks according to his nature. "As saith the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked cometh forth wickedness" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-13.htm">1 Samuel 24:13</a>; cutup. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-2.htm">Proverbs 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-6.htm">Isaiah 32:6</a>). As soon as he opens his month he utters folly, unwisdom, silliness. But he does not stop there. <span class="cmt_word">The end of his talk is mischievous madness.</span> By the time he has finished, he has committed himself to statements that are worse than silly, that are presumptuous, frenzied, indicative of mental and moral depravity. Intemperate language about the secrets of God's providence and the moral government of the world may be intended. Some think that the writer is still alluding to dangerous talk concerning a tyrannical ruler, seditious proposals, secret conspiracies, etc. The text itself does not confirm such notion with any certainty. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A fool also is full of words.</span> The word for "fool" here is oaks/, which implies a dense, confused thinker.

He not only speaks foolishly, but he says too much (cutup. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a>). It is not mere loquacity that is here predicated of the fool, though that is one of his characteristics, but, as-the rest of the verse shows, the prating of things about which he knows nothing. He talks as though he knew everything and there were no limitation to human cognition. <span class="cmt_word">A man cannot tell what shall be</span>. And yet, or although, no man can really predict the future. The fool speaks confidently of such things, and thereby proves his imbecility. Instead of "what shall be," the Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "What has been and what shall be;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quid ante se fuerit</span>, "What has been before him." This reading was introduced probably to obviate a seeming tautology in the following clause, <span class="cmt_word">And what shall be after him, who can tell?</span> But this clause has a different signification from the former, and presents a closer definition. The future intended may be the result of the fool's inconsiderate language, which may have fatal and lasting consequences; or it may refer to the visitation of his sins upon his children, in accordance with the denunciation of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20-22</a>; or it may include the life beyond the grave. The uncertainty of the future is a constant theme; see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>; and compare Christ's parable of the rich fool (<a href="../../par/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-20</a>), and St. James's warning in his Epistle (<a href="../../par/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13-16</a>).

The transition from plural to singular is here made, <span class="accented">The work of fools wearieth him that knoweth not, etc</span>. "Fools' work" signifies, perhaps, the vain speculations about Providence which Koheleth constantly condemns; or at any rate, all vain and objectless toil and trouble. Not to know the way to the city is probably a proverbial saying expressive of gross ignorance concerning the most obvious matters. How should one, who fails in the knowledge open to all experience, be able to investigate and give an opinion about abstruse questions (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8</a>)? For the last clause other interpretations have been proposed, such as, the fool knows not how to transact public business (which is introducing a modern idea); the oppressed peasant knows not the way to the town where he might obtain redress; he is so foolish that he does not understand where he may find patrons whom he may bribe to plead his cause; he is an Essene, who avoids cities; he cannot make his way to the new Jerusalem, the city of God. But these artificial explanations are to be rejected, while the simple interpretation given above is plainly consistent with the context. The lesson is not to meddle with things too high, especially when you are ignorant of the commonest matters. A little wisdom would prevent endless and useless trouble. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:16</a></div><div class="verse">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - Section 15. Koheleth returns to the theme mentioned in vers. 4-7. and speaks <span class="accented">of folly in one who holds the position of king, and the need of wisdom and prudence in the subjects of an unworthy ruler</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child</span>! "Child" is <span class="accented">naar</span>, which term included any age up to manhood. Some interpret the word here, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in Greek, in the sense of "slave," contrasting it with "the son of nobles" in the following verse. But it can hardly signify more than servitor, attendant; and in ver. 7 the antithesis to "prince" is <span class="accented">ebed</span>, not <span class="accented">naar</span>. The child in the present case is a youthful, inexperienced ruler, who does not realize his responsibilities, and is the tool of evil advisers. What particular instance, if any, Koheleth had in view it is impossible to say. Of course, many expositors see a reference to Rehoboam. whom, at forty years of age, his own son Abijah calls <span class="accented">naar</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>), and who was certainly childish in his conduct (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-1.htm">1 Kings 12:1-14</a>). Hitzig connects the passage with the reign of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who was but five years old at the death of his father,  <span class="date">B.C. 205</span>, the reins of government being assumed by Agathocles and his sister Agathoclea, who occasioned serious disasters to the laud. To support this opinion, the date of our book has to be considerably reduced (see Introduction). It is best to take the gnome as a general expression, like that in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-12.htm">Isaiah 3:12</a>, "As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them." <span class="cmt_word">Thy princes eat in the morning.</span> Eating here implies feasting and banqueting, beginning the day with sensual enjoyment instead of such honest work as attending to state matters, administering justice, etc., as becomes good rulers. None but profligates would thus spend the early morning. "These are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it is but the third hour of the day," says St. Peter, repudiating the charge of intoxication (<a href="../../par/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>). "Woe unto them," cries Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), "that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink!" Even the heathen censured such debauchery. Cicero thus abuses Antonius: "At quam multos dies in ea villa turpissime es per-bacchatus. Ab hora tertia bibebatur, ludebatur, vomebatur" ('Philipp.,' 2:41). Curtius (5. 7. 2) reprehends" de die convivia inire." The Greeks had a proverb to denote abnormal sensuality, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:17</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O land, when thy king <i>is</i> the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles</span>! <span class="accented">cujus</span> rex <span class="accented">nobilis est</span> (Vulgate), <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "son of free men" (Septuagint). Some would regard "son of nobles" as a periphrasis expressive of character, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">generous</span>, as "son of strength," equivalent to "strong man;" "son of wickedness," equivalent to "wicked man;" but the phrase may well be taken literally. Koheleth (ver. 7) has expressed his disgust at the exaltation of unworthy slaves to high positions; he here intimates his adherence to the idea that those who descend from noble ancestors, and have been educated in the higher ranks of society, are more likely to prove a blessing to their land than upstarts who have been placed by caprice or favoritism in situations of trust and eminence. Of course, it is not universally true that men of high birth make good rulers; but proverbs of general tenor must not be pressed in particulars, and the author must be understood to affirm that the fact of having distinguished ancestors is an incentive to right action, stirs a worthy emulation in a man, gives him a motive which is wanting in the lowborn parvenu. The feeling, <span class="accented">noblesse oblige</span>, has preserved many from baseness (comp. <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy princes eat in due season</span>; not like those mentioned in ver. 16, but <span class="accented">in tempore</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, at the right time, the "season" which appertains to all mundane things (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For strength, and net for drunkenness.</span> The preposition here is taken as expressing the object - they eat to gain strength, not to indulge sensuality; but it is more in accordance with usage to translate "in, or with, manly strength," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as man's strength demands, and not degenerating into a carouse. If it is thought incongruous, as Ginsburg deems, to say, "princes eat for drunkenness," we may take drunkenness as denoting excess of any kind The word in the form here used occurs nowhere else. The Septuagint, regarding rather the consequences of intoxication than the actual word in the text, renders, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "And they shall not be ashamed." Thus, too, St. Jerome, Et non <span class="accented">in confusione</span>. St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 17:20) deduces from this passage that there are two kingdoms - that of Christ and that of the devil, and he explains the allegory at some length, going into details which are of homiletic utility. Another interpretation is given by St. Jerome, quoted at length by Corn. a Lapide, in his copious commentary.

The subject is still the state. Under the image of a house which falls into ruin for lack of needful repairs, is signified the decay that surely overtakes a kingdom whose rulers are given up to indolence and debauchery, and neglect to attend to the affairs which require prompt care (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>). Such were they whom Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-6.htm">Amos 6:6</a>) denounced, "That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph." "Much slothfulness" is expressed in the original by a dual form, which gives an intensive signification. Ewald and Ginsburg take it as referring to the "two idle hands;" but the intensifications of the dual is not unprecedented (see Delitzsch, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). The rest of this clause is more accurately rendered, <span class="accented">the rafters sink, i.e.</span> the timber framework, whether of roof or wall, gives way. This may possibly not be noticed at once, but it makes itself known unmistakably ere long. <span class="cmt_word">And through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the house leaketh</span>, the roof lets in the rain. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "Through laziness of hands the house will drip." The very imperfect construction of the fiat roofs of Eastern houses demanded continual attention. Such common and annoying occurrences as a leaky roof are mentioned in the Book of Proverbs (see 19:13; 27:15). Plautus, ' Mostell.,' 1:2.28 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ventat imber, lavit parietes; perpluunt<br />Tigna; putrefacit aer operam fabri."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The rain comes down, and washes all the walls,<br />The roof is leaky, and the weather rough<br />Loosens the architect's most skilful work."</span>

So a psalmist speaks of wine as making glad the heart of man (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>); and Ben-Sira says, "Wine is as good as life to a man, if it be drunk moderately: what life is there to a man that is without wine? for it was created to make men glad. Wine measurably drunk and in season bringeth gladness of the heart, and cheer fullness of the mind" (Ecclus. 31.

Leaving alone unanswerable questions, man's duty and happiness are found in activity, especially in doing all the good in his power, for he knows not how soon he himself may stand in need of help. This is <span class="accented">the first remedy for the perplexities of life</span>. The wise man will not charge himself with results. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast thy bread upon the waters.</span> The old interpretation of this passage, which found in it a reference to the practice in Egypt of sowing seed during the inundation of the Nile, is not admissible. The verb <span class="accented">shalaeh</span> is not used in the sense of sowing or scattering seed; it means "to cast or send forth." Two chief explanations have been given. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to sow on the water is equivalent to taking thankless toil (compare the Greek proverb, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>), the gnome may be an injunction to do good without hope of return, like the evangelical precept (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44-46</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-32.htm">Luke 6:32-35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is a commercial maxim, urging men to make ventures in trade, that they may receive a good return for their expenditure. In this case the casting seed upon the waters is a metaphorical expression for sending merchandise across the sea to distant lands. This view is supposed to be confirmed by the statement concerning the good woman in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-14.htm">Proverbs 31:14</a>, "She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her bread from far;" and the words of <a href="../../par/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, "They that go down to the sea in ships, that do Business in great waters." But one sees no reason why Koheleth should suddenly turn to commerce and the trade of a maritime city. Such considerations have no reference to the context, nor to the general design of the book. Nothing leads to them, nothing comes of them. On the other hand, if we take the verse as urging active beneficence as the safest and best proceeding under men's present circumstances, We have a maxim in due accordance with the spirit of the rest of the work, and one which conduces to the conclusion reached at the end. So we adopt the first of the two explanations mentioned above. The bread in the East is made in the form of thin cakes, which would float for a time if thrown into a stream; and if it be objected that no one would be guilty of such an irrational action as flinging bread into the water, it may be answered that this is just the point aimed at. Do your kindnesses, exert yourself, in the most unlikely quarters, not thinking of gratitude or return, but only of duty. And yet surely a recompense will be made in some form or other. Thou shalt find it after many days. This is not to be the motive of our acts, but it will in the course of time be the result; and this thought may be an encouragement. In the Chaldee Version of parts of Ecclesiasticus there is extant a maxim identical with our verse, "Strew thy bread on the water and on the land, and thou shalt find it at the end of days" (Dukes, 'Rabb. Btumenl.,' p. 73). Parallels have been found in many quarters. Thus the Turk says, "Do good, throw it into the water; if the fish does not know it, God does." Herzfeld quotes Goethe - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Was willst du untersuchen,<br />Wohin die Milde fliesst!<br />Ins Wasser wirf deine Kuchen;<br />Wer weiss wet sie geniesst?"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Wouldst thou too narrowly inquire<br />Whither thy kindness goes!<br />Thy cake upon the water cast;<br />Whom it may feed who knows?"</span> Voltaire paraphrases the passage in his 'Precis de l'Ecclesiaste' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Repandez vos bienfaits avec magnificence,<br />Meme aux moins vertueux ne les refusez pas.<br />Ne vous informez pas de leur reconnoissance;<br />Il est grand, il est beau de faire des ingrats."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight</span>. This further explains, without any metaphor, the injunction of beneficence in ver. 1. Give portions of thy "bread" to any number of those who need. Delitzsch and others who interpret the passage of maritime enterprise would see in it a recommendation (like the proceeding of Jacob, <a href="../../par/genesis/32-16.htm">Genesis 32:16</a>, etc.) not to risk all at once, to divide one's ventures into various ships. But the expression in the text is merely a mode of enjoining unlimited benevolence. The numbers are purposely indefinite. Instances of this form of speech are common enough (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-7.htm">Proverbs 30:7-9</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. etc.; <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>; Ecclus. 23:16 Ecclus. 26:5, 28). Wordsworth notes that the word for "<span class="accented">portion"</span> (<span class="accented">chelek</span>) is that used specially for the portion of the Levites (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20</a>); and in accordance with his view of the date of the book, finds here an injunction not to confine one's offerings to the Levites of Judah, but to extend them to the refugees who come from Israel. <span class="cmt_word">For thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</span> A time may come when you yourself may need help; the power of giving may no longer be yours; therefore make friends now who may be your comfort in distress. So the Lord urges, "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>). It seems a low motive on which to base charitable actions; but men act on such secondary motives every day, and the moralist cannot ignore them. In the Book of Proverbs secondary and worldly motives are largely urged as useful in the conduct of life (see the Introduction to Proverbs, pp. 8, 9.). St. Paul reminds us that we some day may need a brother's help (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The Fathers have spiritualized the passage, so as to make it of Christian application, far away indeed from Koheleth's thought. Thus St. Gregory: "By the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is understood the whole of this temporal condition...  this is shown more plainly when the number <span class="accented">eight</span> is mentioned after it. For when another number besides follows after seven, it is set forth by this very addition, that this temporal state is brought to an end and closed by eternity. For by the number <span class="accented">seven</span> Solomon expressed the present time, which is passed by periods of seven days. But by the number <span class="accented">eight</span> he designated eternal life, which the Lord made known to us by his resurrection. For he rose in truth on the Lord's day, which, as following the seventh day, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sabbath, is found to be the eighth from the creation. But it is well said, 'Give portions,' etc. As if it were plainly said, 'So dispense temporal goods, as not to forget to desire those that are eternal. For thou oughtest to provide for the future by well-doing, who knowest not what tribulation succeeds from the future judgment'" ('Moral,' 35:17, Oxford transl.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">If the clouds be full of rain, they empty <i>themselves</i> upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth.</span> This verse is closely connected with the preceding paragraph. The misfortune there intimated may fall at any moment; this is as certain as the laws of nature, unforeseen, uncontrollable. When the clouds are overcharged with moisture, they deliver their burden upon the earth, according to laws which man cannot alter; these are of irresistible necessity, and must be expected and endured. And if the tree fall toward the, south, etc.; or, it may be, <span class="accented">in the south</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let it fall where it will; the particular position is of no importance. When the tempest overthrows it, it lies where it has fallen. When the evil day comes, we must bend to the blow, we are powerless to avert it; the future can be neither calculated nor controlled. The next verse tells how the wise man acts under such circumstances. Christian commentators have argued from this clause concerning the unchangeable state of the departed - that there is no repentance in the grave; that what death leaves them judgment shall find them. Of course, no such thought was in Koheleth's mind; nor do we think that the inspiring Spirit intended such meaning to be wrung from the passage. Indeed, it may be said that, as it stands, the clause does not bear this interpretation. The fallen or felled tree is not at once fit for the master's use; it has to be exposed to atmospheric influences seasoned, tried. It is not left in the place where it lay, nor in the condition in which it was; so that, if we reason from this analogy, we must conceive that there is some ripening, purifying process in the intermediate state. St. Gregory speaks thus: "For when, at the moment of the falling of the human being, either the Holy Spirit or the evil spirit receives the soul departed from the chambers of the flesh, he will keel, it with him for ever without change, so that neither, once exalted, shall it be precipitated into woe, nor, once plunged into eternal woes, any further arise to take the means of escape" ('Moral.,' 8:30).

The fact of the uncertainty and immutability of the future ought not to make us supine or to crush out all diligence and activity. He who wants to anticipate results, to foresee and provide against all contingencies, to be his own providence, is like a farmer who is always looking to wind and weather, and misses the time for sowing in this needless caution. The quarter from which the wind blows regulates the downfall of rain (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>). In Palestine the west and north-west winds usually brought rain. <span class="cmt_word">He that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</span> For the purpose of softening the ground to receive the seed, rain was advantageous; but storms in harvest, of course, were pernicious (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a>); and he who was anxiously fearing every indication of such weather, and altering his plans at every phase of the sky, might easily put off reaping his fields till either the crops were spoiled or the rainy season had set in. A familiar proverb says," A watched pot never boils." Some risks must always be run if we are to do our work in the world; we cannot make a certainty of anything; probability in the guide of life. We cannot secure ourselves from failure; we can but do our best, and uncertainty of result must not paralyze exertion. "It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that hath mercy" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>). St. Gregory deduces a lesson from this verse: "He calls the unclean spirit <span class="accented">wind</span>, but men who are subjected to him <span class="accented">clouds</span>; whom he impels backwards and forwards, hither and thither, as often as his temptations alternate in their hearts from the blasts of suggestions. He therefore who observes the wind does not sow, since he who dreads coming temptations does not direct his heart to doing good. And he who regards the clouds does not reap, since he who trembles from the dread of human fickleness deprives himself of the recompense of an eternal reward" ('Moral.,' 27:14). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">As thou knowest not what <i>is</i> the way of the spirit, <i>nor</i> how the bones <i>do grow</i> in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit.</span> In this verse are presented one or two examples of man's ignorance of natural facts and processes as analogous to the mysteries of God's moral government. The word translated "spirit" (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) may mean also "wind," and is so taken here by many commentators (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). In this view there would be two instances given, viz. the wind and the embryo. Certainly, the mention of the wind seems to come naturally after what has preceded; and man's ignorance of its way, and powerlessness to control it, are emblematic of his attitude towards Divine providence. The versions, however, seem to support the rendering of the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint (which connects the clause with ver. 4), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> ("among whom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who watch the weather), "There is none that knoweth what is the way of the spirit (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate. <span class="accented">Quomodo ignoras quae sit via spiritus</span>. If we take this view, we have only one idea in the verse, and that is the infusion of the breath of life in the embryo, and its growth in its mother's womb. <span class="cmt_word">Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child</span>. Our version, by its insertions, has made two facts out of the statement in the Hebrew, which is literally, <span class="accented">holy the bones</span> (are) <span class="accented">in the womb of a pregnant woman</span>. Septuagint, "As (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span>) bones are in the womb," etc.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qua ratione compingantur ossa in ventre praegnantis, "</span> And in what way the bones are framed in the womb of the pregnant." The formation and quickening of the foetus were always regarded as mysterious and inscrutable (comp. <a href="../../par/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>; Wisd. 7:1, etc.). Wright compares M. Aurelius, 10:26, "The first principles of life are extremely slender and mysterious; and yet nature works them up into a strange increase of bulk, diversity, and proportion." Controversies concerning the origin of the soul have been rife from early times, some holding what is called Traducianism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that soul and body are both derived by propagation from earthly parents; others supporting Creationism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the soul, created specially by God, is infused into the child before birth. St. Augustine confesses ('Op. Imperf.,' 4:104) that he is unable to determine the truth of either opinion. And, indeed, this is one of those secret things which Holy Scripture has not decided for us, and about which no authoritative sentence has been given. The term "bones" is used for the whole conformation of the body (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>); <span class="accented">meleah</span>, "pregnant," means literally, "full," and is used like the Latin <span class="accented">plena</span> can here and nowhere else in the Old Testament, though common in later Hebrew. Thus Ovid, 'Metam.,' 10:469 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Plena patris thalamis excedit, et impia dire<br />Semina fert utero."</span> And 'Fast.,' 4:633 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Nunc gravidum pecus est; gravidae sunt semine terrae<br />Telluri plenae victima plena datur."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</span> Equally mysterious in its general scope and in its details is the working of God's providence. And as everything lies in God's hands, it must needs be secret and beyond human ken. This is why to "the works of God" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>) is added, "who maketh all." The God of nature is Lord of the future (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; Ecclus. 18:6); man must not disquiet himself about this. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both <i>shall be</i> alike good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the morning sow thy seed</span>. Do not let your ignorance of the future and the inscrutability of God's dealings lead you to indolence and apathy; do your appointed work; be active and diligent in your calling. The labor of the farmer is taken as a type of business generally, and was especially appropriate to the class of persons whom Koheleth is instructing. The injunction occurs naturally after ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">And in the evening withhold not thine hand.</span> Labor on untiredly from morn till evening. It is not an advice to rest during midday, as that was too hot a time to work (Stuart), but a call to spend the entire day in active employment, the two extremities being mentioned in order to include the whole. Work undertaken in a right spirit is a blessing, not a curse, shuts out many temptations, encourages many virtues. Some see here a  special reference to the maxim at the beginning of the chapter, as though the author meant, "Exercise thy charity at all times, early and late," the metaphor being similar 'to that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, "He which soweth sparingly," etc. Others find a figure of the ages of, man in the "morning and evening," thus, "From earliest youth practice piety and purity, and continue such conduct to its close." This leads naturally to the subject of the following section; but it may be doubted whether this thought was in the author's mind. It seems best to take the paragraph merely as commending activity, whether in business or in benevolence, without anxious regard to results which are in higher hands. "Withhold not thy hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from sowing; <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">For thou knowest not whether shall prosper</span>, which of the two sewings, <span class="cmt_word">either this or that</span>, the morning or evening sowing. It is a chance, and a man must risk something; if one fails, the other may succeed. <span class="cmt_word">Or whether they both shall be alike good</span>. The uncertainty rouses to exertion; labor may at any rate secure half the crop, or even give a double produce, if both sewings succeed. So in religion and morality, the good seed sown early and late may bear fruit early or late, or may have blessed results all along. The Vulgate is less correct, <span class="accented">Et si utrumque simul, melius</span> or, "And if both together, it will be better."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">But if a man live many years, <i>and</i> rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all</span>. The conjunction <span class="accented">ki</span> at the commencement of the verse is causal rather than adversative, and should be rendered "for." The insertion of "and" before "rejoice" mars the sentence. The apodosis begins with "rejoice," and the translation is, <span class="accented">For if a man live many years, he ought to rejoice in them all</span>. Koheleth has said (ver. 7) that life is sweet and precious; now he adds that it is therefore man's duty to enjoy it; God has ordained that he should do so, whether his days on earth be many or few. <span class="cmt_word">Yet let him remember the days of darkness.</span> The apodosis is continued, and the clause should run, <span class="accented">And remember</span>, etc. "The days of darkness ' do not mean times of calamity as contrasted with the light of prosperity, as though the writer were bidding one to be mindful of the prospect of disastrous change in the midst of happiness; nor, again, the period of old age distinguished from the glowing light of youth (Virgil, 'AEneid,' L 590, 591). The days of darkness signify the life in Hades, far from the light of the sun, gloomy, uncheered. The thought of this state should not make us hopeless and reckless, like the sensualists whose creed is to "eat and drink, for to-morrow we die" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:82; Wisd. 2:1, etc.), but rouse us to make the best of life, to be contented and cheerful, doing our daily duties with the consciousness that this is our day of labor and joy, and that "the night cometh when no man can work ' (<a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>). Wisely says Beu-Sira, "Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss" (Ecclus. 7:36). We are reminded of the Egyptian custom, mentioned by Herodotus (2. 78), of carrying a figure of a corpse among the guests at a banquet, not in order to damp pleasure, but to give zest to the enjoyment of the present and to keep it under proper control. "Look on this!" it was cried; "drink, and enjoy thyself; for when thou diest thou shalt he such." The Roman poet has many a passage like this, though, of course, of lower tendency. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Preserve, O my Dellius, whatever thy fortunes,<br />A mind undisturbed, 'midst life's changes and ills;<br />Not cast down by its sorrows, nor too much elated<br />If sudden good fortune thy cup overfills,"</span> etc.<br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) (See also 'Carm.,' 1:4.) <span class="cmt_word">For they shall be many</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that they shall be many</span>. This is one of the things to remember. The time in Sheol will be long. How to be passed - when, if ever, to end - he says not; he looks forward to a dreary protracted period, when joy shall be unattainable, and therefore he bids men to use the present, which is all they can claim. <span class="cmt_word">All that cometh is vanity.</span> All that comes after this life is ended, the great future, is nothingness; shadow, not substance; a state from which is absent all that made life, and over which we have no control. Koheleth had passed the sentence of vanity on all the pursuits of the living man; now he gives the same verdict upon the unknown condition of the departed soul (comp, <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a>). Till the gospel had brought life and immortality to light, the view of the future was dark and gloomy. So we read in Job (Job 10:21, 22), "I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death; a land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness." The Vulgate gives quite a different turn to the clause, rendering, <span class="accented">Meminisse debet tenebrosi temporis, et dierum multorum</span>; <span class="accented">qui cum venerint, vanitatis arguentur praeterita</span>, "He ought to remember...  the many days; and when these have come, things passed shall be charged with vanity" - which implies, in accordance with an haggadic interpretation of the passage, that the sinner shall suffer for his transgressions, and shall then learn to acknowledge his folly in the past. It is unnecessary to say that the present text is at variance with this rendering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a></div><div class="verse">Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these <i>things</i> God will bring thee into judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth</span>. Koheleth continues to inculcate the duty of rational enjoyment. "In youth" is during youth; not in the exercise of, or by reason of, thy fresh, unimpaired powers. The author urges his hearers to begin betimes to enjoy the blessing with which God surrounds them. Youth is the season of innocent, unalloyed pleasure; then, if ever, casting aside all tormenting anxiety concerning an unknown future, one may, as it is called, enjoy life. <span class="cmt_word">Let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth.</span> Let the lightness of thy heart show itself in thy bearing and manner, even as it is said in Proverbs (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-13.htm">Proverbs 15:13</a>), "A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance." <span class="cmt_word">Walk in the ways of thine heart</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>). Where the impulses and thoughts of thy heart lead thee. The wording looks as if the personal identity, the "I," and the thought were distinct. We have a similar severance in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>, only there the personality directs the thought, not the thought the "I," <span class="cmt_word">And in the sight of thine eyes.</span> Follow after that on which thy eyes fix their regard (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>); for, as Job says (<a href="../../par/job/31-7.htm">Job 31:7</a>), "The heart walketh after the eyes." The Septuagint, in deference to the supposed requirements of strict morality, has (at least according to the text of some manuscripts) modified the received reading, translating the passage thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And walk in the ways of thine heart blameless, and not in the sight of thine eyes." But <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is omitted by A, C, S. Others besides the Seventy have felt doubts about the bearing of the passage, as though it recommended either unbridled license in youth, or at any rate an unhallowed Epicureanism. To counteract the supposed evil teaching, some have credited Koheleth with stern irony. He is not recommending pleasure, say they, but warning against it. "Go on your way," he cries, "do as you list, sow your wild oats, live dissolutely, but remember that retribution will some day overtake you." But the counsel is seriously intended, and is quite consistent with many other passages which teach the duty of enjoying life as man's lot and part (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>, etc.). The seeming opposition between the recommendation here and in <a href="../../par/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a> is easily reconciled. The injunction in the Pentateuch, which was connected with a ceremonial observance, ran thus: "Remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye used to go a-whoring." Here unlawful pleasures, contrary to the commandments, are forbidden; Ecclesiastes urges the pursuit of innocent pleasures, such as will stand scrutiny. Hoelemann, quoted by Wright, observes that this verse is the origin of a famous student-song of Germany, a stanza or two of which we may cite - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Gaudeamus igitur, juvenes dum sumus;<br />Post exactam juventutem, post melestam senectutem,<br />Nos habebit humus ....</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Vita nostra brevis est, brevi finietur,<br />Venit mors velociter, rapit nes atrociter,<br />Nemini parcotur."</span> It is not Epicureanism, even in a modified form, that is here encouraged. For moderate and lawful pleasure Koheleth has always uttered his sanction, but the pleasure is to be such as God allows. This is to be accepted with all gratitude in the present, as the future is wholly beyond our ken and our control; it is all that is placed in our power, and it is enough to make life more than endurable. And then to temper unmixed joy, to prove that he is not recommending mere sensuality, to correct any wrong impression which the previous utterances may have conveyed, the writer adds another thought, a somber reflection which shows the religious conclusion to which he is working up. <span class="cmt_word">But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</span> (<span class="accented">mishpat</span>). It has been doubted what is meant by "judgment," whether present or future, men's or God's. It has been taken to mean - God will make thy excesses prove scourges, by bringing on thee sickness, poverty, a miserable old age; or these distresses come as the natural consequences of youthful sins; or obloquy shall follow thee, and thou shall meet with deserved censure from thy fellow-men. But every one must feel that the solemn ending of this paragraph points to something more grave and important than any such results as those mentioned above, something that is concerned with that indefinable future which is ever looming in the dim horizon. Nothing satisfies the expected conclusion but a reference to the eternal judgment in the world beyond the grave. Shadowy and incomplete as was Koheleth's view of this great assize, his sense of God's justice in the face of the anomalies of human life was so strong that he can unhesitatingly appeal to the conviction of a coming inquisition, as a motive for the guidance of action and conduct. That in other passages he constantly apprehends earthly retribution, as the Pentateuch taught, and as his countrymen had learned to expect (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17, 18</a>), is no argument that he is not here rising to a higher view. Rather, the fact that the doctrine of temporal reward and punishment is found by experience to fail in many cases (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a>) has forced him to state his conclusion that this life is not the end of-everything, and that there is another existence in which actions shall be tried, justice done, retribution awarded. The statement is brief, for he knew nothing more than the fact, and could add nothing to it. His conception of the soul's condition in Sheol (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6, 10</a>) seems to point to some other state or period for this final judgment; but whether a resurrection is to precede this awful trial is left in uncertainty here, as elsewhere in the Old Testament. Cheyne and some other critics consider this last clause to be an interpolation, because it appears to militate against previous utterances; but this argument is unreasonable, as the paragraph comes in quite naturally as the needed conclusion, and without it the section would halt and be incomplete. A similar allusion is contained in the epilogue (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). A correcter, who desired to remove all seeming contradictions and discrepancies from the work, would not have been satisfied with inserting this gloss, but would have displayed his remedial measures in other places. Of this proceeding, however, no traces are discernible by an unprejudiced eye. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth <i>are</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10</span> - <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>. - Section 18. The <span class="accented">third remedy is piety</span>, and this ought to be practiced from one's earliest days; life should be so guided as not to offend the laws of the Creator and Judge, and virtue should not be postponed till the failure of faculties makes pleasure unattainable, and death closes the scene. The last days of the old man are beautifully described under certain images, metaphors, and analogies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart.</span> The writer reiterates his advice concerning cheerfulness, and then proceeds to inculcate early piety. <span class="accented">Kaas</span>, rendered "sorrow," has been variously understood. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">gram</span>; so the margin of the Authorized Version gives "anger," and that of the Revised Version "vexation," or "provocation." Wordsworth adopts this last meaning (relating to <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-30.htm">1 Kings 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-22.htm">1 Kings 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>, etc., where, however, the signification is modified by the connection in which the word stands), and paraphrases, "Take heed lest you provoke God by the thoughts of your heart." Jerome affirms that in the term "anger" all perturbations of the mind are included - which seems rather forced. The word is better rendered, low spirits, moroseness, discontent. These feelings are to be put away from the mind by a deliberate act. <span class="cmt_word">Put away evil from thy flesh</span>. Many commentators consider that the evil here named is physical, not moral, the author enjoining his young disciple to take proper care of his body, not to weaken it on the one hand by asceticism, nor on the other by indulgence in youthful lusts. In this case the two clauses would urge the removal of what respectively affects the mind and body, the inner and outer man. But the ancient versions are unanimous in regarding the "evil" spoken of as moral. Thus the  Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "wickedness;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">malitiam</span>. Similarly the Syriac and Targum. And according to our interpretation of the passage, such is the meaning here. It is a call to early piety and virtue, like that of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-1.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>), "Having these promises, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." Do not, says Koheleth, defile thy body by carnal sins (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>), which bring decay and sickness, and arouse the wrath of God against thee<span class="cmt_word">. For childhood and youth are vanity.</span> This time of youth soon passes away; the capacity for enjoyment is soon circumscribed; therefore use thy opportunities aright, remembering the end. The word for "youth" (<span class="accented">shacharuth</span>) occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament, and is probably connected with <span class="accented">shachon</span>, "black," used of hair in <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-31.htm">Leviticus 13:31</a>. Hence it means the time of black hair, in contradistinction to the time when the hair has become grey. The explanation which refers it to the time of dawn (Psalm 110:8) seems to be erroneous, as it would then be identical with" childhood." The Septuagint renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "folly;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">voluptas</span>, "pleasure;" the Syriac, "and not knowledge, but the word cannot be rightly thus translated. The two terms are childhood and manhood, the period during which the capacity for pleasure is fresh and strong. Its vanity is soon brought home; it is evanescent; it brings punishment.

think who made thee, and what thou wast made for, not for self-pleasing only, not to gratify thy passions which now are strong; but that thou mightest use thy powers and energy in accordance with the laws of thy being as a creature of God's hands, responsible to him for the use of the faculties and capacities with which he has endowed thee. The word for "Creator" is the participle of the Verb <span class="accented">barn</span>, which is that used in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, etc., describing God's work. It is plural in form, like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the plural being that of majesty or excellence (comp. <a href="../../par/job/35-10.htm">Job 35:10</a>: <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). It is used here as an appellation of God, because the young have to bethink themselves that all they are and all they have come from God. Such plurals are supposed by some to be divinely intended to adumbrate the doctrine of the Holy Trinity - a dark saying containing a mystery which future revelation shoed explain. "He that made thee" is a common phrase in Ecclesiasticus (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>; 7:30; 39:5). It is to be noted that Gratz reads "cistern" or a fountain" in place of "Creator," and explains this term to mean "wife, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15-18</a>. But the alteration has nothing to support it, and is most unnecessary, though Cheyne was inclined to adopt it ('Job and Solomon,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">While the evil days come not</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before they come. "Days of evil; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;</span>) (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>); <span class="accented">tempus afflictionis</span> (Vulgate). The phrase refers to the grievances and inconveniences of old age, which are further and graphically  described in the following verses, though whether the expressions therein used regard literal anatomical facts, or are allegorical representations of the gradual decay of the faculties, has been greatly disputed. Probably both opinions contain a partial truth, as will be noted in our Exposition. Ginsburg considers that the allusion is not to the ills that in the course of time all flesh is heir to, but rather to that premature decay and suffering occasioned by the unrestrained gratification of sensual passions, such as Cicero intimates ('De Senect.,' 9:29), "Libidinosa et intemperans adulescentia effetum corpus tradit senectuti." There is nothing specially in the text to support this view, and it is most reasonable to see here generally a figurative description of decay, whatever may be the cause. <span class="cmt_word">I have no pleasure in them.</span> Ere the time comes when a man shall say, "I have no pleasure in life." Thus the aged Barzillai asks," Can I discern between good and evil? Can thy servant taste what I eat, or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing-men and singing-women?" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - From this verse onwards there is great diversity of interpretation. While some think that the approach of death is represented under the image of a storm, others deem that what is here intended is first the debility of old age, and then, at ver. 6, death itself, which two stages are described under various metaphors and figures. <span class="cmt_word">While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened.</span> Under these figures the evil days spoken of above, the advent and infirmities of old age, are represented. It would be endless and unprofitable to recount the explanations of 'the terms used in the following verses. Every commentator, ancient and modern, has exerted his ingenuity to force the poet's language into the shape which he has imagined for it. But, as we said above, there are at least two distinct lines of interpretation which have found favor with the great majority of expositors. One of these regards the imagery as applicable to the effects of a heavy storm upon a house and its inmates, explaining every detail under this notion; the other regards the terms used as referring to the man himself, adumbrating the gradual decay of old age, the various members and powers that are affected being represented under tropes and images, Both interpretations are beset with difficulties, and are only with some straining and accommodation forced into a consistent harmony. But the latter seems to us to present fewer perplexities than the other, and we have adopted it here. At the same time, we think it expedient to give the other view, together with our own, as there is much to be said in its favor, and many great writers have declared themselves on its side. Wright supposes (and makes a good case for his theory) that Koheleth is referring especially to the closing days of winter, which in Palestine are very fatal to old people. The seven last days, indeed, are noted even now as the most sickly and dangerous of all the year. The approach of this period casts a dark shadow upon all the inhabitants of the house. The theory is partly borne out by the text, but, like the other solutions, does not wholly correspond to the wording. In the present verse the approach of old age, the winter of life, is likened to the rainy season in Palestine, when the sun is obscured by clouds, and the light of heaven darkened by the withdrawal of that luminary, and neither moon nor stars appear. <span class="cmt_word">And the clouds return after the rain</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one storm succeeds another (<a href="../../par/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>). The imagery is intended to represent the abiding and increasing inconveniences of old age. Not like the spring-time of life and season, when sunshine and storm are interchanged, winter and old age have no vicissitudes, one dreary character invests them both. The darkening of the light is a common metaphor for sorrow and sadness (see <a href="../../par/job/30-26.htm">Job 30:26</a>; <a href="../../par/job/33-28.htm">Job 33:28, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>). The symbolism of the details in this verse has been thus elucidated: The diurnal lights appertain to the soul, the nocturnal to the body; the sun is the Divine light which illumines the soul, the moon and the stars are the body and the senses which receive their radiance from the soul's effulgence. These are all affected by the invasion of old age. Some consider that this verse depicts the changes which pass over the higher and more spiritual part of man's nature, while the succeeding imagery refers to the breaking up of the corporeal frame. We should say rather that ver. 2 conveys a general impression, and that this is then elaborated into particulars. According to the interpretation mentioned above, a gathering tempest is here depicted, the details of which are worked out in the following verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windows be darkened,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The gradual decay which creeps over the body, the habitation of the spirit, is depicted under the figure of a house and its parts (comp. <a href="../../par/job/4-19.htm">Job 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-13.htm">2 Peter 1:13, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this is the case when, etc. The hands and arms are appropriately called the keepers of the house, for with them (as Volek quotes from Galen) man <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> ("arms and guards his body in various ways"). The shaking and palsy of old men's limbs are thus graphically described. This would be one of the first symptoms discerned by an observer. Taking the alternative interpretation, we should see in these "keepers" the menservants who keep watch before the house. These menials are appalled by the approach of the tempest, and quake. <span class="cmt_word">And the strong men shall bow themselves.</span> The "men of power" are the legs, or the bones generally, which in the young are "as pillars of marble" (<a href="../../par/songs/5-15.htm">Song of Solomon 5:15</a>), but in the old become feeble, slack, and bent. Delitzsch quotes 3Macc. 4:5, where we read of a multitude of old men being driven mercilessly, "stooping from age, and dragging their feet heavily along." In this clause it is this stooping and bending of the body that is noticed, when men are no longer upright in stature, "swifter than eagles," "stronger than lions" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-23.htm">2 Samuel 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>), fit for war and active employment. It is therefore less appropriate to see in the "keepers" the legs, and in the "strong men" the arms. Otherwise, the latter are the masters, the wealthy and noble, in contradistinction to the menials before mentioned: both lords and servants are equally terrified at the approach of the tempest, or, as Wright would say, at the touch of the sickly season (see on ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">And the grinders cease because they are few</span>. The word for "grinders" is feminine (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "the grinding-women," Septuagint), doubtless because grinding was especially women's business (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-41.htm">Matthew 24:41</a>). By them are meant the teeth, as we speak of <span class="accented">molars</span>, though, of course, the term here applies to all the teeth; so the Greeks used the term <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for the <span class="accented">denies molares</span>. These, becoming few in number and no longer continuous, cannot perform their office. Otherwise, the grinding-women leave their work or pause in their labors at the approach of the storm, though one does not quite see why they should be fewer than usual, unless the sickly season has prostrated most of their companions, or that many are too frightened to ply their task. Having, therefore, harder work than usual, they stop at times to recruit themselves. But the analogy rather breaks down here; one would be inclined to suppose that their decreased numbers would make them apply themselves more assiduously to their necessary occupation. As the "keepers" in the former part of the verse were slaves, so these grinders are slaves, such occupation being the lowest form of service (see <a href="../../par/exodus/11-5.htm">Exodus 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-10.htm">Job 31:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Those that look out of the windows be darkened.</span> These are the eyes that look forth from the cavities in which they are sunk; they are regarded as the windows of the bodily structure, the eyelashes or eyelids possibly being deemed the lattice of the same. Plumptre cites Cicero, ' De Nat. Deer.,' 2:140: "Sensus interpretes ac nuntii return, in capite, tamquam in arce, mirifice ad usus necessaries et facti et collocati sunt. Nam oculi, tamquam speculatores, altissimum locum obtinent; ex quo plurima conspicientes, fungantur sue munere." The dimness in the eye and the failing in the powers of sight are well expressed by the terms of the text. It is noted of Moses, as something altogether abnormal, that at a hundred and twenty years of age "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>). Taking the alternative interpretation, we must regard those that look out of the windows as the ladies of the house, who have no menial work to do, and employ their time in gazing idly from the lattices (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/5-28.htm">Judges 5:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6</a>). These "are darkened," they are terror-stricken, their faces gather blackness (<a href="../../par/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>), or they retire into corners in terror of the storm. These women are parallel to "the strong men" mentioned above; so that the weather affects all of every class - men-servants and maidservants, lords and ladies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The doors shall be shut in the streets</span>. Hitherto the symbolism has been comparatively easy to interpret. With this verse inextricable difficulties seem to arise. Of course, in one view it is natural that in the bitter weather, or on the appearance of a tempest, the doors towards the street should be closed, and none should leave the house. But what are meant by the doors in the metaphorical house, the body of the aged man? Jewish expositors understood them to be the pores, or excretive apertures of the body, which lose their activity in old age - which seems an unseemly allusion. Plumptre will have them to be the organs which carry on the processes of sensation and nutrition from the beginning to the end; but it seems a forced metaphor to call these "double-doors." More natural is it to see in the word, with its dual form, the mouth closed by the two lips. So a psalmist speaks of the mouth, the door of the lips (<a href="../../par/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/micah/7-5.htm">Micah 7:5</a>). As it is only the external door of a house that could be employed in this metaphor, the addition, "in [or, 'towards'] the streets," is accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">When the sound of the grinding is low</span>. The sound of the grinding or the mill is weak and low when the teeth have ceased to masticate, and, instead of the crunching and grinding of food, nothing is heard but a munching and sucking. The falling in of the mouth over the toothless gums is represented as the closing of doors. To take the words in their literal sense is to make the author repeat himself, reiterating what he is supposed to have said before in speaking of the grinding-women - all labor is lessened or stopped. The sound of grinding betokened cheerfulness and prosperity; its cessation would be an ominous sign (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-10.htm">Jeremiah 25:10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-22.htm">Revelation 18:22</a>). Another interpretation considers this clause to express the imperfect vocal utterance of the old man; but it is hardly likely that the author would call speech "the voice of the grinding," or of the mill, as a metaphor for "mouth." <span class="cmt_word">And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird</span>. This is a very difficult sentence, and has been very variously explained. It is usually taken to mean that the old man sleeps lightly and awakes (for "rises up" may mean no more than that) at the chirrup of a bird. The objection to this interpretation is that it destroys the figurative character of the description, introducing suddenly the personal subject. Of course, it has another signification in the picture of the terror-stricken household; and many interpreters who thus explain the allegory translate the clause differently. Thus Ginsburg renders, "The swallow rises to shriek," referring to the habits of that bird in stormy weather. But there are grammatical objections to this translation, as there are against another suggestion, "The bird (of ill omen) raises its voice." We need not do more than refer to the mystical elucidation which detects here a reference to the resurrection, the voice of the bird being the archangel's trumpet which calls the dead from their graves. Retaining the allegory, we must translate the clause, "He [or, 'it,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the voice] rises to the bird's voice;" the old man's voice becomes a "childish treble," like the piping of a little bird. The relaxation of the muscles of the larynx and other vocal organs occasions a great difference in the pitch or power of tone (compare what Hezekiah says, <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>, "Like a crane or a swallow so did I chatter," though there it is the low murmur of sorrow and complaint that is meant). <span class="cmt_word">And all the daughters of music shall be brought low.</span> "The daughters of song" are the organs of speech, which ere now humbled and fail, so that the man cannot sing a note. Some think that the ears are meant, as St. Jerome writes, Et <span class="accented">obsurdescent omnes filiae carminis</span>, which may have some such notion. Others arrive at a similar signification from manipulation of the verb, thus eliciting the sense - The sounds of singing-women or song-birds are dulled and lowered, are only heard as a faint, unmeaning murmur. This exposition rather contradicts what had preceded, viz. that the old man is awoke by the chirrup of a sparrow; for his ears must be very sensitive to be thus easily affected; unless, indeed, the "voice of the bird" is merely a note of time, equivalent to early cock-crowing. We must not omit Wright's explanation, though it does not commend itself to our mind. He makes a new stanza begin here: "When one rises at the voice of the bird," and sees here a description of the approach of spring, as if the poet said, "When the young and lusty are enjoying the return of genial weather, and the concert of birds with which no musician can compete, the aged, sick in their chambers, are beset with fears and are sinking fast." We fail altogether to read this meaning in our text, wherein we recognize only a symbolical representation of the old man's vocal powers. It is obvious to cite Juvenal's minute and painful description of old age in 'Sat.,' 10:200, etc., and Shakespeare's lines in 'As You Like It' (act 2. sc. 7), where the reference to the voice is very striking- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"His big, manly voice,<br />Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br />And whistles in his sound."</span> Cox paraphrases, "The song-birds drop silently into their nests," alarmed at the tempest. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">Also <i>when</i> they shall be afraid of <i>that which is</i> high, and fears <i>shall be</i> in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high</span>. There is no "when" in the original, which runs, "Also, or yea, they fear on high." "They" are old men, or, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>, "people" indefinitely; and the clause says that they find difficulty in mounting an ascent, as the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">Excelsa</span> <span class="accented">quoque timebant</span>. Shortness of breath, asthmatic tendencies, failure of muscular power, make such an exertion arduous and burdensome, just as in the previous verse a similar cause rendered singing impossible. The description is now arriving at the last stage, and allegorizing the closing scene. The steep ascent is the <span class="accented">via dolorosa</span>, the painful process of dying, from which the natural man shrinks; for as the gnome says - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span><br /><span class="accented">"None dotes on life more than the aged man."</span> The old man is going on the appointed road, <span class="cmt_word">and fears shall be in the way</span>; or, <span class="accented">all sorts of fears</span> (plural of intensity) <span class="accented">are in the path</span>; as in his infirm condition he can walk nowhere without danger of meeting with some accident, so analogously, as he contemplates his end and the road he has to travel, "fearfulness and trembling come upon him, and horror overwhelms him" (<a href="../../par/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5</a>). Plumptre sees in these clauses a further adumbration of the inconveniences of old age, how that the decrepit man makes mountains of mole-hills, is full of imaginary terrors, always forecasting sad events, and so on; but this does not carry on the picture to the end which the poet has now in view, and seems tame and commonplace. The supporters of the storm-theory explain the passage as denoting the fears of the people at what is coming from on high - the gathering tempest, these fears extending to those on the highway, - which is feeble. <span class="cmt_word">And the almond tree shall flourish</span>; or, <span class="accented">is in blossom</span>. The old man is thus figured from the observed aspect of this tree. It blossoms in winter upon a leafless stem, and its flowers, at first of a pale pink color, turn to a snowy whiteness as they fall from the branches. The tree thus becomes a fit type of the arid, torpid-looking old man with his white hair. So Wright quotes Virgil, 'AEneid,' 5:416 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus;ETT*> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>though there the idea is rather of mingled black and grey hair than of ahead of snowy whiteness. Canon Tristram ('Nat. Hist. of the Bible,' p. 332), referring to the usual version of this clause, adds, "But the better interpretation seems to be, that as the almond blossom ushers in the spring, so do the signs referred to in the context indicate the <span class="accented">hastening</span> (<span class="accented">shaked</span>, 'almond,' meaning also 'hasten') of old age and death." Plumptre adopts the notion that the name of the tree is derived from a stem meaning <span class="accented">"to watch,"</span> and that thus it may be called <span class="accented">the early-waking tree</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-11.htm">Jeremiah 1:11</a>), the enigmatic phrase describing the wakefulness that often attends old age. But this seems a refinement by no means justified by the use of the word. Others find in the verb the signification <span class="accented">"to</span> disdain, loathe," and explain that the old man has lost his taste for almond nuts, which <span class="accented">seems to be</span> an unnecessary observation after the previous allusions to his toothless condition, the cracking and eating of such things requiring the grinders to be in perfect order. The versions are unanimous in translating the clause as the Authorized Version. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">Vulgate, fiorebit amygdalus</span>. (So Verier. and the Syriac.) Wright takes this clause and the next to indicate the opening of spring, when nature reawakens from its winter sleep, and the dying man can no longer respond to the call or enjoy the happy season. The expositors who adhere to the notion of the storm would translate, "the almond shall be rejected," alluding to fear taking away appetite; but the rendering is faulty. <span class="cmt_word">And the grasshopper shall he a burden.</span> <span class="accented">Chagab</span>, rendered "grasshopper" here and <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>, etc., is rightly translated "locust" in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15</a>. It is one of the smaller species of the insect, as is implied by its use in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-22.htm">Isaiah 40:22</a>, where from the height of heaven the inhabitants of earth are regarded as <span class="accented">chagabim</span>. The clause is usually explained to mean that the very lightest burden is troublesome to old age, or that the hopping and chirping of these insects annoy the querulous senior. But who does not see the incongruity of expressing the disinclination for labor and exertion by the figure of finding a grasshopper too heavy to carry? Who would think of carrying a grasshopper? Plumptre, who discovers Greek allusions in the most unlikely places, sees here an intimation of the writer's acquaintance with the Athenians' custom of wearing a golden grasshopper on their heads as a token that they were <span class="accented">autochthones</span>, "sprung from the soil." Few will be disposed to concur with this opinion. Ginsburg and others consider that Koheleth is regarding the locust as an article of food, which it was and still is in the East (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-21.htm">Leviticus 11:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>). In some places it is esteemed a great delicacy, and is cooked and prepared in a variety of ways. So here the writer is supposed to mean that dainties shall tempt in vain; even the much-esteemed locust shall be loathed. But we cannot imagine this article of food, which indeed was neither general nor at all seasons procurable, being singled out as an appetizing esculent. The solution of the enigma must be sought elsewhere. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">imping</span>, <span class="accented">uabitur locusts</span>, "the locust grows fat. Founded on this rendering is the opinion which considers that under this figure is depicted the corpulence or dropsical swelling that sometimes accompanies advanced life. But this morbid and abnormal condition could not be introduced into a typical description of the usual accompaniments of age, even if the verb could be rightly translated as the Greek and Latin versions give it, which is more than doubtful. Delitzsch, after some Jewish interpreters, considers that under the term "locust" is meant the loins or hips, or <span class="accented">caput femoris</span>, which is thus named" because it includes in itself the mechanism which the two-membered foot for springing, placed at an acute angle, presents in the locust." The poet is thought to allude to the loss of elasticity in the hips and the inability to bear any weight. We cannot agree to the propriety of this artificial explanation, which seems to have been invented to account for the expressions in the text, rather than to be founded on fact. But though we reject this elucidation of the figure, we think Delitzsch and some others are right in taking the verb in the sense of "to move heavily, to crawl along." "The locust crawls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the old man drags his limbs heavily and painfully along, like the locust just hatched in early spring, and as yet not furnished with wings, which makes it8 way clumsily and slowly. The analogy derives another feature from the fact, well attested, that the appearance of the locust was synchronous with the days considered most fatal to old people, namely, the seven at the end of January and the beginning of February. So we now have the figure of the old man with his snow-white hair, panting and gasping, creeping painfully to his grave. One more <span class="accented">trait is</span> added. <span class="cmt_word">And desire shall fail.</span> The word rendered "desire" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is found nowhere else in the Old Testament, and its meaning is disputed. The Authorized Version has adopted the rendering of some of the Jewish commentators (and that of Venet., <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), but, according to Delitzsch, the feminine form of the noun precludes the notion of an abstract quality, and the etymology on which it rests is doubtful. Nor would it be likely that, having employed symbolism hitherto throughout his description, the writer would suddenly drop metaphor and speak in unfigurative language. We are, therefore, driven to rely for its meaning on the old versions, which would convey the traditionary idea. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">capparis</span>, by which is designated the caper tree or berry, probably the same as the hyssop, which is found throughout the East, and was extensively used as a provocative of appetite, a stimulant and restorative. Accordingly, the writer is thought here to be intimating that even stimulants, such as the caper, affect the old man no longer, cannot give zest to or make him enjoy his food. Here, again, the figurative is dropped, and a literal, unvarnished fact is stated, which mars the perfection of the picture. But the verb here used (<span class="accented">parar</span>) is capable of another signification, and is often found in the unmetaphorical sense of "breaking" or "bursting;" so the clause will run, "and the caper berry bursts." Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dissipabitur capparis</span>. The fruit of this plant, when overripe, bursts open and falls off - a fit image of the dissolution of the aged frame, now ripe for the tomb, and showing evident tokens of decay. By this interpretation the symbolism is maintained, which perhaps is further illustrated by the fact that the fruit hangs down and droops from the end of long stalks, as the man bows his head and stoops his back to meet the coming death. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> (<span class="accented">ki</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man goeth to his long home</span>. This and the following clause are parenthetical, ver. 6 resuming the allegory. It is as though Koheleth said - Such is the way, such are the symptoms, when decay and death are approaching; all these things happen, all these signs meet the eye, at such & period. "His long home;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (Septuagint), "to the house of his eternity," "his everlasting habitation," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the grave, or Hades. There is a similar expression in Tobit 3:6, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which in the Hebrew editions of that book is given as, "Gather me to my father, to the house appointed for all living," with which Canon Churton (<span class="accented">in lot</span>.) compares <a href="../../par/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/job/30-23.htm">Job 30:23</a>. So <a href="../../par/psalms/49-11.htm">Psalm 49:11</a> (according to many versions), "Their graves are their houses for ever." The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="../../par/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a> are a periphrasis for life in heaven. Diodorus Siculus notes that the Egyptians used the terms <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of Hades (2. 51; 1. 93). The expression, "domus eterna," appears at Rome on tombs, as Plumptre observes, both in Christian and non-Christian inscriptions; and the Assyrians name the world or state beyond the grave "the house of eternity" ('Records of the Past,' 1:143). From the expression in the text nothing can be deduced concerning Koheleth's eschatological views. He is speaking here merely phenomenally. Men live their little span upon the earth, and then go to what in comparison of this is an eternity. Much of the difficulty about <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., would be obviated if critics would remember that the meaning of such words is conditioned by the context, that e.g. "everlasting" applied to a mountain and to God cannot be understood in the same, sense. <span class="cmt_word">And the mourners go about the streets</span>. This can hardly mean that the usual funeral rites have begun; for the death is not conceived as having already taken place; this is reserved for ver. 7. Nor can it, therefore, refer to the relations and friends who are sorrowing for the departed. The persons spoken of must be the mourners who are hired to play and sing at funerals (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>). These were getting ready to ply their trade, expecting hourly the old man's death. So the Romans had their <span class="accented">praeficae</span>, and persons "qui conducti plorant in funere" (Horace, 'Ars Poet.,' 431). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Or ever</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before, ere (<span class="accented">ad asher lo</span>). The words recall us to vers. 1 and 2, bidding the youth make the best use of his time ere old age cuts him off. In the present paragraph the final dissolution is described under two figures. <span class="cmt_word">The silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken.</span> This is evidently one figure, which would be made plainer by reading "and" instead of "or," the idea being that the lamp is shattered by the snapping of the cord that suspended it from the roof. But there are some difficulties in the closer explanation of the allegory. The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the reservoir of oil in a lamp (see <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-3.htm">Zechariah 4:3, 4</a>), which supplies nourishment to the flame; when this is broken or damaged so as to be useless, the light, of course, is extinguished. The Septuagint calls it <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">vitta aurea</span>, "the golden fillet," or flower ornament on a column, which quite sinks the notion of a light being quenched. The "cord" is that by which the lamp is hung in a tent or a room. But of what in man are these symbols? Many fanciful interpretations have been given. The "silver cord" is the spine, the nerves generally, the tongue; the "golden bowl" is the head, the membrane of the brain, the stomach. But these anatomical details are not to be adopted; they have little to recommend them, and are incongruous with the rest of the parable. The general break-up of life is here delineated, not the progress of destruction in certain organs or parts of the human frame. The cord is what we should call the thread of life, on which hangs the body lit by the animating soul; when the connection between these is severed, the latter perishes, like a fallen lamp lying crushed on the ground. In this our view the cord is the living power which keeps the corporeal substance from failing to ruin; the bowl is the body itself thus upheld. The mention of gold and silver is introduced to denote the preciousness of man's life and nature. But the analogy must not be pressed in all possible details. It is like the parables, where, if defined and examined too closely, incongruities appear. <span class="accented">We</span> should be inclined to make more of the lamp and the light and the oil, which are barely inferred in the passage, and endeavor to explain what these images import. Koheleth is satisfied with the general figure which adumbrates the dissolution of the material fabric by the withdrawal of the principle of life. What is the immediate cause of this dissolution, injury, paralysis, etc., is not handled; only the rupture is noticed and its fatal result. Another image to the same effect, though pointing to a different process, is added <span class="cmt_word">Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the wheel broken at</span> (<span class="accented">in</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the cistern.</span> The picture here is a deep well or cistern with an apparatus for drawing water; this apparatus consists of a wheel or windlass with a rope upon it, to which is attached a bucket; the wheel fails, falls into the well, the bucket is dashed to pieces, and no water can be drawn. It is best to regard the two clauses as intended to convey one idea, as the two at the beginning of the verse were found to do. Some commentators, not so suitably, distinguish between the two, making the former clause say that the pitcher is broken on its road to or from the spring, and the latter that the draw-wheel gives way. The imagery, points to one notion which would be weakened by being divided into two. The motion of the bucket, the winding up and down, by which water is drawn from the well, is an emblem of the movements of the heart, the organs of respiration, etc. When these cease to act, life is extinct. The fraction of the cord and the demolition of the bowl denoted the separation of soul and body; the breaking of the pitcher and the destruction of the wheel signify the overthrow of the bodily organs by which vital motion is diffused and maintained, and the man lives. The expressions in the text remind one of the term, "earthen vessel," applied by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>) to the human body; and "the fountain of life," "the water of life." so often mentioned in Holy Scripture as typical of the grace of God and the blessedness of life with him (see <a href="../../par/psalms/36-9.htm">Psalm 36:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-6.htm">Revelation 21:6</a>).

Here we are told what becomes of the complex man at death, and are thus led to the explanation of the allegorical language used throughout. Without metaphor now it is stated that the material body, when life is extinct, returns to that matter out of which it was originally made (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/job/34-15.htm">Job 34:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). So Siracides calls man "dust and ashes," and asserts that all things that are of the earth turn to the earth again (Ecclus. 10:9 Ecclus. 40:11).

In the first clause the preposition "to" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>, as if to mark the distinction between the downward and the upward way. The writer now rises superior to the doubts expressed in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a> (where see note), "Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward," etc.? It is not that he contradicts himself in the two passages, as some suppose, and have hence regarded ver. 7 as an interpolation; but that after all discussion, after expressing the course of his perplexities, and the various phases of his thought, he comes to the conclusion that there is a future for the individual soul, and that it shall be brought into immediate connection with a personal God. There is here no thought of its being absorbed in the <span class="accented">anima mundi</span>, in accordance with the heathen view, which, if it believed dimly in an immortality, denied the personality of the soul (see Eurip., ' Suppl.,' 529-534; Lucret., 2. 998, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:455, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.). Nor have we any opinion given concerning the adverse doctrines of creationism and traducianism, though the terms used are most consistent with the former. God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life; when this departs, he who gave receives it; God "gathereth in" man's breath (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>). The clause, taken in this restricted sense, would say nothing about the soul, the personal "I;" it would merely indicate the destination of the vital breath; and many critics are content to see nothing more in the words. But surely this would be a feeble conclusion of the author's wanderings; rather the sentence signifies that death, releasing the spirit, or soul, from the earthly tabernacle, places it in the more immediate presence of God, there, as the Targum paraphrases the passage, returning to stand in judgment before its Creator. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - It has been much questioned whether this verse is the conclusion of the treatise or the commencement of the epilogue. For the latter conclusion it is contended that it is only natural that the beginning of the final summing-up should start with the same words as the opening of the book (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>); and that thus the conjunction "and," with which ver. 9 begins, is readily explained. But the treatise is more artistically completed by regarding this solemn utterance as the conclusion of the whole, ending with the same burden with which it began - the nothingness of earthly things. Koheleth has labored to show this, he has pursued the thought from beginning to end, through all circumstances and conditions, and he can only re-echo his melancholy refrain. <span class="cmt_word">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher.</span> He does not follow the destiny of the immortal spirit; it is not his purpose to do so; his theme is the fragility of mortal things, their unsatisfying nature, the impossibility of their securing man's happiness: so his voyage lands him at the point whence he set forth, though he has learned and taught faith in the interval. If all is vanity, there is behind and above all a God of inflexible justice, who must do right, and to whom we may safely trust our cares and perplexities. <span class="accented">Koheleth," Preacher</span>," here has the article, <span class="accented">the Koheleth</span>, as if some special reference was made to the meaning of the name - he who has been debating, or haranguing, or gathering together, utters finally his careful verdict. This is the sentence of the ideal Solomon, who has given his experiences in the preceding pages.

What the writer here asserts is that Koheleth did not merely possess wisdom, but had made good use of it for the instruction of others. The author throws aside his disguise, and speaks of his object in composing the book, with a glance at the historical Solomon whom he had personated. That he uses the third person in relation to himself is nothing uncommon in historical memoirs, etc. Thus Daniel writes; and St. John, Thucydides, Xenophon, Caesar, mask their personality by dropping their identity with the author (comp. also <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>). The attestation that follows is compared with that at the end of St. John's Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/21-24.htm">John 21:24</a>), and is plainly intended to confirm the authority of the writer, and to enforce on the hearer the conviction that, though Solomon himself did not compose the work, it has every claim to receive attention, and possesses intrinsic value. <span class="cmt_word">He still taught the people knowledge.</span> As well as being esteemed one of the company of sages, he further (<span class="accented">od</span>) took pains to instruct his contemporaries (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint), to apply his wisdom to educational purposes. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he gave good heed</span>; literally, he <span class="accented">weighed</span> (like our word "ponder"); only thus used in this passage. It denotes the careful examination of every fact and argument before it was presented to the public. <span class="cmt_word">Sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span> There is no copula in the original; the weighing and the investigation issued in the composition of "proverbs," which term includes not only the wit and wisdom of past ages in the form of pithy sayings and apophthegms, but also parables, truths in metaphorical guise, riddles, instructions, allegories, etc., all those forms which are found in the canonical Book of Proverbs. The same word (<span class="accented">mishle</span>) <span class="accented">is used</span> here as in the title of <span class="accented">that</span> book. Koheleth, however, is not necessarily referring to that work (or to <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>, etc.), or implying that he himself wrote it; he is only putting forth his claim to attention by showing his patient assiduity in the pursuit of wisdom, and how that he adopted a particular method of teaching. For the idea contained in the verb <span class="accented">taqan</span>, "to place or make straight" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>), applied to literary composition, Delitzsch compares the German word for" author" (<span class="accented">Schriftsteller</span>). The notion of the <span class="accented">mashal</span> being similitude, comparison, the writer's pondering and searching were needed to discover hidden analogies, and, by means of the known and familiar, to lead up to the more obscure and abstruse. The Septuagint has a curious and somewhat unintelligible rendering, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "And the ear will trace out the order of parables," which Schleusner translates, "elegantes parabolas."

Thus we have "stones of pleasure" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/54-12.htm">Isaiah 54:12</a>). He added the grace of refined diction to the solid sense of his utterances. Plumptre reminds us of the "gracious words" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/4-22.htm">Luke 4:22</a>) which proceeded from the mouth of him who, being the Incarnate Wisdom of God, was indeed greater than Solomon. On the necessity of a work being attractive as well as conforming to literary rules, Horace long ago wrote ('Ars Poet.,' 99) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non satis est pulchra esse poemata; dulcia sunto,<br />Et quoeunque volent animum auditoris agunto."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"'Tis not enough that poems faultless be,<br />And fair; let them be tender too, and draw<br />The hearer by the cord of sympathy."</span> St. Augustine is copious on this subject in his treatise, 'De Doctr. Christ.;' thus (4:26): "Proinde ilia tria, ut intelligant qui audiunt, ut delectentur, ut obediant, etiam in hoc genere agendum est, ubi tenet delectatio principatum .... Sed quis movetur, si nescit quod dicitur? Ant quis tenetur ut audiat, si non delectatur?" <span class="cmt_word">And that which was written was upright, even words of truth.</span> The Authorized Version, with its interpolations, does not accurately convey the sense of the original. The sentence is to be regarded as containing phrases in apposition to the "acceptable words" of the first clause; thus: "Koheleth sought to discover words of pleasure, and a writing in sincerity, words of truth. 'The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a writing of uprightness;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">et conscripsit sermones rectissimos</span>. The meaning is that what he wrote had two characteristics - it was sincere, that which he really thought and believed, and it was true objectively. If any reader was disposed to cavil, and to depreciate the worth of the treatise because it was not the genuine work of the celebrated Solomon, the writer claims attention to his production on the ground of its intrinsic qualities, as inspired by the same wisdom which animated his great predecessor. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">The words of the wise <i>are</i> as goads, and as nails fastened <i>by</i> the masters of assemblies, <i>which</i> are given from one shepherd.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of the wise are as goads</span>. The connection of this verse with the preceding is maintained by the fact that the "acceptable words," etc., are words of the wise, emanate from the same persons. Herewith he proceeds to characterize them, with especial reference to his own work. The goad was a rod with an iron spike, or sharpened at the end, used in driving oxen (see <a href="../../par/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-21.htm">1 Samuel 13:21</a>; Ecclus. 38:25; <a href="../../par/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>). Words of wisdom are called goads because they rouse to exertion, promote reflection and action, restrain from error, impel to right; if they hurt and sting, the pain which they inflict is healthful, for good and not for evil. <span class="cmt_word">And as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies</span>. The proposition "by" is an interpolation, and the sentence should run: Ant/ <span class="accented">like nails fastened</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">the, etc</span>. <span class="accented">- masmeroth</span>, "nails," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-7.htm">Isaiah 41:7</a>. There is much difficulty in explaining the next words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">baale asuppoth</span>). We have had similar expressions applied to possessors in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:11</a>, "lord of the tongue," and "lord of wings" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>); and analogy might lead us to apply the phrase here to-persons, and not things; but in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a> we find a threshing-instrument termed "lord of teeth;" and in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a> a town is called Baal-Perazim, "Lord of breaches;" so we must be guided by other considerations in our exposition. The Septuagint, taking the whole sentence together, and regarding <span class="accented">baals</span> as a preposition, renders, "As nails firmly planted, (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) which from the collections were given from one shepherd." Schleus-her takes <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> to mean, "<span class="accented">Ii</span> quibus munus datum erat collectionem faciendi," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the author, of collections. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Verba</span>...  <span class="accented">quae per magistrorum consilium data sunt a pastore uno</span>. The "masters of assemblies" can only be the chiefs of some learned conclaves, like the great synagogue supposed to exist in the time of Ezra and later. The clause would then assert that these pundits are like fastened nails, which seems rather unmeaning. One might say that their uttered sentiments became fixed in the mind as nails firmly driven in, but one could not properly say this of the men themselves. A late editor, Gietmann, suggests that "lords of collection" may mean "brave men, heroes, gathered in line of battle," serried ranks, just as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-20.htm">Proverbs 22:20</a> the <span class="accented">term shalishim</span>, chariot-fighters, chieftains, is applied to choice proverbs. Thus he would say that the words of the wise are as goads because they stimulate the intellect, as nails because they readily find entrance, and like men in battle array when they are reduced to writing and marshaled in a book. This is certainly ingenious, but somewhat too artificial to be regarded as the genuine intention of the writer. It seems best to take the word translated "assemblies" as denoting collections, not of people, but of proverbs; and the compound phrase would thus mean proverbs of an excellent character, the best of their sort gathered together in writing. Such words are well compared to nails; they are no longer floating loosely about, they are fixed in the memory, they secure other knowledge, and, though they are separate utterances, they have a certain unity and purpose. Nails are often used proverbially as emblems of what is fixed and unalterable. Thus AEschyl., 'Suppl.,' 944 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x1fef;&#x39d;&#x39b;&#x1ffd;&#x393;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Through them a nail is firmly fixed, that they<br />May rest immovable."</span> Cicero, 'Verr.,' 2:5.21, "Ut hoc beneficium, quemadmodum dicitur, trabali clave figeret;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to make it sure and steadfast (comp. Horace, 'Carm.,' 1:35. 17, et <span class="accented">seq</span>.). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Which are given from one shepherd</span>. All these words of the wise, collections, etc., proceed from one source, or are set forth by one authority. Who is] this shepherd? Some say that he is the <span class="accented">archisynagogus</span>, the president of the assemblies of wise men, to whose authority all these public utterances are subjected. But we do not <span class="accented">know</span> that such supervision existed or was exercised at the time when Koheleth wrote; and, as we saw above, there is probably no reference to any such assemblies in the passage. The "one shepherd" is doubtless Jehovah, who is called the Shepherd of Israel, who feeds his people like a flock, etc. (see <a href="../../par/genesis/48-15.htm">Genesis 48:15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>, etc.). The appellation is here used as concinnous with the thought of the ox-goad, intimating that God watches and leads his people like a tender shepherd and a skilful farmer. This is an important claim to inspiration. All these varied utterances, whatever form they take, whether his own or his predecessor's, are outcomes of wisdom, and proceed from him who is only wise, Almighty God. It is no disparagement of this work to imply that it is not the production of the true Solomon; Koheleth is ready to avow himself the writer, and yet claims a hearing as being equally moved by heavenly influence. It is like St. Paul's assertion (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>), "I think that I also have the Spirit of God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books <i>there is</i> no end; and much study <i>is</i> a weariness of the flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - The author warns against profitless study, and gives the final conclusion to which the whole discussion leads. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And further, by these, my son, be admonished</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and what is more than these, be warned</span>. Besides all that has been said, take this additional and important caution, viz. what follows. The clause, however, has been differently interpreted, as if it said, "Do not attempt to go beyond the words of the sages mentioned above; or, "Be content with my counsels; they will suffice for your instruction." This seems to be the meaning of the Authorized Version. The personal address, "my son," so usual in the Book of Proverbs, is used by Koheleth in this place alone. It does not necessarily imply relationship (as if the pseudo-Solomon was appealing to Rehoboam), but rather the condition of pupil and learner, sitting at the feet of his teacher and friend. <span class="cmt_word">Of malting many books there is no end.</span> This could not be said in the time of the historical Solomon, even if we reckon his own voluminous works (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32, 33</a>); for we know of no other writers of that date, and it is tolerably certain that none existed in Palestine. But we need not suppose that Koheleth is referring to extraneous heathen productions, of which, in our view, there is no evidence that he possessed any special knowledge. Doubtless many thinkers in his time had treated of the problems discussed in his volume in a far different manner from that herein employed, and it seemed good to utter a warning against the unprofitable reading of such productions. Juvenal speaks of the insatiable passion for writing in his day ('Sat.,' 7:51) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Tenet insanabile multos<br />Scribendi cacoethes et aegro in corde senestit;"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>which Dryden renders - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The charms of poetry our souls bewitch;<br />The curse of writing is an endless itch."</span> As in taking food it is not the quantity which a man eats, but what he digests and assimilates, that nourishes him, so in reading, the rule, <span class="accented">Non multa, sed multum</span>, must be observed; the gorging the literary appetite on food wholesome or not impedes the healthy mental process, and produces no intellectual growth or strength. The obvious lesson drawn by spiritual writers is that Christians should make God's Word their chief study, "turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge which is falsely so called" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>). For as St. Augustine says ('De Doctr. Christ.'), "Whereas in Holy Scripture you will find everything which has been profitably said elsewhere, to a far greater extent you will therein find what has been nowhere else enunciated, but which has been taught solely by the marvelous sublimity and the equally marvelous humility of the Word of God." <span class="cmt_word">Much study is a weariness of the flesh.</span> The two clauses in the latter part of the verse are co-ordinate. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("weariness") <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "study" (<span class="accented">lahag</span>) is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, nor in the Talmud, but the above meaning is sustained by its connection with an Arabic word signifying "to be eager for." The Vulgate (like the Septuagint) renders it <span class="accented">meditatio</span>. You may weary your brain, exhaust your strength, by protracted study or meditation on many books, but you will not necessarily thereby gain any insight into the problems of the universe or guidance for daily life. Marcus Aurelius dissuades from much reading: "Would you examine your whole composition?" he says; "pray, then let your library alone; what need you puzzle your thoughts and over-grasp yourself?" Again, "As for books, never be over-eager about them; such a fondness for reading will be apt to perplex your mind, and make you die unpleased" ('Medit.,' 2:2, 3, Collier). So Ben-Sira affirms, "The finding out of parables is a wearisome Labor of the mind" (Ecclus. 13:26).

Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hoc est enim omnis homo</span>. For this man was made and placed in the world; this is his real object, the chief good which he has to seek, and which alone will secure contentment and happiness. The obligation is put in the most general terms as applicable to the whole human family; for God is not the God of the Jews only, but of Gentiles also (<a href="../../par/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether <i>it be</i> good, or whether <i>it be</i> evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The great duty just named is here grounded upon the solemn truth of a future judgment. <span class="cmt_word">For God shall bring every work into judgment.</span> It will then be seen whether this obligation has been 'attended to or not. The judgment has already been mentioned (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a>); it is here more emphatically set forth as a certain fact and a strong motive power. The old theory of earthly retribution had been shown to break down under the experience of practical life; the anomalies which perplexed men's minds could only be solved and remedied by a future judgment under the eye of the omniscient and unerring God. <span class="cmt_word">With every secret thing.</span> The Syriac adds, "and manifest thing." The Septuagint renders, "with everything that has been overlooked" - a very terrible, but true, thought. The doctrine that the most secret things shall be revealed in the dies <span class="accented">irae</span> is often brought forward in the New Testament, which makes plain the personal nature of this final investigation, which the earlier Scriptures invest with a more general character (see <a href="../../par/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>). So this wonderful book closes with the enunciation of a truth found nowhere else so clearly defined in the Old Testament, and thus opens the way to the clearer light shed upon the awful future by the revelation of the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../songs/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Song of Solomon 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Song of Solomon 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/1.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../proverbs/31.htm" title="Proverbs 31">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 1 <a href="../ecclesiastes/2.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, King in Jerusalem</span>; Septuagint, "King of Israel in Jerusalem" (comp. ver. 12). The word rendered "Preacher" is <span class="accented">Koheleth</span>, a feminine noun formed from a verb <span class="accented">kalal</span>, "to call" (see Introduction, &sect; 1), and perhaps better rendered" Convener" or "Debater." It is found nowhere else but in this book, where it occurs three times in this chapter (vers. 1, 2, 12), three times in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8, 9, 10</a>, and once in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-27.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:27</a>. In all but one instance (viz. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>) it is used without the article, as a proper name. Jerome, in his commentary, translates it, 'Continuator,' in his version 'Ecclesiastes.' It would seem to denote one who gathered around him a congregation in order to instruct them in Divine lore. The feminine form is explained in various ways. Either it is used abstractedly, as the designation of an office, which it seems not to be; or it is formed as some other words which are found with a feminine termination, though denoting the names of men, indicating, as Gesenius notes (&sect; 107, 3. 100.), a high degree of activity in the possessor of the particular quality signified by the stem; e.g. Alemeth, Azmaveth (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-36.htm">1 Chronicles 8:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-42.htm">1 Chronicles 9:42</a>), Pochereth (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-57.htm">Ezra 2:57</a>), Sophereth (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-57.htm">Nehemiah 7:57</a>); or, as is most probable, the writer desired to identify Koheleth with Wisdom, though it must be observed that the personality of the author often appears, as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16-18</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-23.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:23</a>, etc.; the <span class="accented">role</span> of Wisdom being for the nonce forgotten. The word "king" in the title is shown by the accentuation to be in apposition to "Koheleth" not to "David;" and there can be no doubt that the description is intended to denote Solomon, though his name is nowhere actually given, as it is in the two other works ascribed to him (<a href="../../par/proverbs/1-1.htm">Proverbs 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-1.htm">Song of Solomon 1:1</a>). Other intimations of the assumption of Solomon's personality are found in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:12</a>, "I Koheleth was king," etc.; so in describing his consummate wisdom (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>), and in his being the author of many proverbs (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:9</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-32.htm">1 Kings 4:32</a>) - accomplishments which are not noted in the case of any other of David's descendants. Also the picture of luxury and magnificence presented in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2</a>. suits no Jewish monarch but Solomon. The origin of the name applied to him may probably be traced to the historical fact mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-55.htm">1 Kings 8:55</a>, etc., where Solomon gathers all Israel together to the dedication of the temple, and utters the remarkable prayer which contained blessing and teaching and exhortation. As we have shown in the Introduction (&sect; 2), the assumption of the name is a mere literary device to give weight and importance to the treatise to which it appertains. The term, "King in Jerusalem," or, as in ver. 12, "King over Israel in Jerusalem," is unique, and occurs nowhere else in Scripture. David is said to have reigned in Jerusalem, when this seat of government is spoken of in contrast with that at Hebron (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), and the same expression is used of Solomon, Rehoboam, and others (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2, 10</a>); and the phrase probably denotes a time when the government had become divided, and Israel had a different capital from Judah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-11.</span> - PROLOGUE.

"Vanity" is <span class="accented">hebel</span>, which means "breath," and is used metaphorically of anything transitory, frail, unsatisfying. We have it in the proper name Abel, an appropriate designation of the youth whose life was cut short by a brother's murderous hand. "Vanity of vanities," like "heaven of heavens" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>), "song of songs" (<a href="../../par/songs/1-1.htm">Song of Solomon 1:1</a>), etc., is equivalent to a superlative, "most utterly vain." It is here an exclamation, and is to be regarded as the key-note of the whole subsequent treatise, which is merely the development of this text. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; other Greek translators, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "vapor of vapors." For "saith" the Vulgate gives <span class="accented">dixit</span>; the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>; but as there is no reference to any previous utterance of the Preacher, the present is more suitable here. In affirming that "all is vanity," the writer is referring to human and mundane things, and directs not his view beyond such phenomena. Such reflection is common in sacred and profane writings alike; such experience is universal (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/47-9.htm">Genesis 47:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/39-5.htm">Psalm 39:5-7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/90-3.htm">Psalm 90:3-10</a>; <a href="../../par/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14</a>). "Pulvis et umbra sumus," says Horace ('Carm.,' 4:7. 16. "O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!" (Persius, 'Sat.,' 1:1). If Dean Plumptre is correct in contending that the Book of Wisdom was written to rectify the deductions which might be drawn from Koheleth, we may contrast the caution of the apocryphal writer, who predicates vanity, not of all things, but only of the hope of the ungodly, which he likens to dust, froth, and smoke (see Wisd. 2:1, etc.; 5:14). St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>) seems to have had Ecclesiastes in mind when he spoke of the creation being subjected to vanity (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>), as a consequence of the fall of man, not to be remedied till the final restitution of all things. "But a man will say, If all things are vain and vanity, wherefore were they made? If they are God's works, how are they vain? But it is not the works of God which he calls vain. God forbid! The heaven is not vain; the earth is not vain: God forbid! Nor the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor our own body. No; all these are very good. But what is vain? Man's works, pomp, and vain-glory. These came not from the hand of God, but are of our own creating. And they are vain because they have no useful end That is called vain which is expected indeed to possess value, yet possesses it not; that which men call empty, as when they speak of 'empty hopes,' and that which is fruitless. And generally that is called vain which is of no use. Let us see, then, whether all human things are not of this sort" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hem. 12. in Ephes.').

The interrogative form of the verse conveys a strong negative (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:8</a>), like the Lord's word in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, "What shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?" The epilogue (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>) furnishes a reply to the desponding inquiry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>One</i> generation passeth away, and <i>another</i> generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh.</span> The translation rather weakens the force of the original, which is, <span class="accented">a generation goeth</span>, <span class="accented">and a generation cometh</span>. Man is only a pilgrim on earth; he soon passes away, and his place is occupied by others. Parallelisms of this sentiment will occur to every reader. Thus Ben-Sira, "All flesh waxeth old as a garment: for the covenant from the beginning is, Thou shalt die the death. As of the green leaves on a thick tree, some fall and some grow; so is the generation of flesh and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.

While the constant succession of generations of men goes on, the earth remains unchanged and immovable. If men were as permanent as is their dwelling-place, their labors might profit; but as things are, the painful contrast between the two makes itself felt. The term, "for ever," like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, does not necessarily imply eternity, but often denotes limited or conditioned duration, as when the slave is engaged to serve his master "for ever" (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>), or the hills are called "everlasting" (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a>). This verse gives one instance of growth and decay in contrast with insensate continuance. The following verses give further examples. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down</span>. The sun is another instance of ever-recurring change in the face of an enduring sameness, rising and setting day-by-day, and resting never. The legendary 'Life of Abram' relates how, having been hidden for some years in a cave in order to escape the search of Nimrod, when he emerged from his concealment, and for the first time beheld heaven and earth, he began to inquire who was the Creator of the wonders around him. When the sun arose and flooded the scene with its glorious light, he at once concluded that that bright orb must be the creative Deity, and offered his prayers to it all day long. But when it sank in darkness, he repented of his illusion, being persuaded that the sun could not have made the world and be itself subject to extinction (see 'Abraham: his Life and Times,' p. 12). <span class="cmt_word">And hasteth to his place where he arose;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and panteth</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">hasteth</span>, <span class="accented">longeth to go</span>) <span class="accented">to its place arising there</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the sun, sinking in the west, eagerly during the night returns to the east, duly to rise there in the morning. The "place" is the region of reappearance. The Septuagint gives, "The sun arises, and the sun sets, and draws (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) unto its place;" and then carries the idea into the following verse: "Arising there, it proceedeth southward," etc. The Vulgate supports the rendering; but there is no doubt that the Authorized Version gives substantially the sense of the Hebrew text as accentuated. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">shaaph</span>), as Delitzsch shows, implies "punting," not from fatigue, but in eager pursuit of something; and all notions of panting steeds or morning exhalations are quite foreign from the conception of the passage. The notion which Koheleth desires to convey is that the sun makes no real progress; its eager punting merely brings it to the old place, there to recommence its monotonous routine. Rosenm&uuml;ller quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 5:4-6, on which, Doering cites Lotich., 'Eleg.,' 3:7. 23 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ergo ubi permensus coelum sol occidit, idem<br />Purpureo vestit lumine rursus humum;<br />Nos, ubi decidimus, defuncti muncre vitae,<br />Urget perpetua hmina nocte sopor."</span> But our passage does not contrast the revival of the sun every morning with man's eternal sleep in death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north;</span> literally, <span class="accented">going towards the south</span>, <span class="accented">and circling towards the north</span>. These words, as we have seen above, are referred to the sun by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac; but it is best to make this verse refer only to the wind - a fresh example of motion continually repeated with no real progress to an end. Thus each verse comprises one subject and idea, ver. 4 being concerned with the earth, ver. 5 with the sun, ver. 6 with the wind, and ver. 7 with the waters. There seems to be no particular force in the naming of north and south, unless it be in contrast to the sun's motion from east to west, mentioned in the preceding verse. The words following show that these two directions are not alone intended. Thus the four quarters are virtually included. <span class="cmt_word">It whirleth about continually.</span> The original is more forcible, giving by its very form the idea of weary monotony. The subject is delayed till the last, thus: <span class="accented">Going towards the south</span>... <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">circling</span>, <span class="accented">goeth the wind</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. it blows from all quarters at its own caprice. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind returneth again according to his circuits</span>. <span class="accented">And on its circlings returneth the wind</span>; it comes back to the point whence it started. The wind, seemingly the freest of all created things, is bound by the same law of immutable changeableness, insensate repetition.

Doubtless the idea is general, and such as would strike every observer, however little he might trouble himself with the reason of the circumstance (comp. Ecclus. 40:11). <span class="cmt_word">Unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again;</span> rather, <span class="accented">unto the place whither the rivers go</span>, <span class="accented">thither they go again</span>. As Wright and Delitzsch observe, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> after verbs of motion has often the signification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; and the idea is that the streams continue to make their way into the sea with ceaseless iteration. The other rendering, which is supported by the Vulgate <span class="accented">undo</span>, seems rather to favor the Epicurean poet's solution of the phenomenon. Lucretius, in the passage cited above, explains that the amount of water contributed by rivers is a mere drop in the ocean; that a vast quantity rises in exhalations and is spread far and wide over the earth; and that another large portion finds its way back through the pores of the ground to the bed of the sea. Plumptre considers that this theory was known to Koheleth, and was introduced by him here. The rendering which we have given above would make this opinion untenable; it likewise excludes the idea (though that, indeed, may have been entertained by the Hebrews, <a href="../../par/psalms/109-10.htm">Psalm 109:10</a> and <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-28.htm">Proverbs 8:28</a>) of the clouds being produced by the sea and feeding the springs. Thus Ecclus. 40:11, "All things that are of the earth do turn to the earth again; and that which is of the waters doth return into the sea." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">All things <i>are</i> full of labour; man cannot utter <i>it</i>: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All things are full of labor</span>. Taking the word <span class="accented">dabar</span> in the sense of "ward" (compare the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), the LXX. translates, "All words are wearisome;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to go through the whole catalogue of such things as those mentioned in the preceding verses would be a laborious and unprofitable task. The Targum and many modern expositors approve this rendering. But besides that, the word <span class="accented">yaged</span> implies suffering, not causing, weariness (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>); the run of the sentence is unnecessarily interrupted by such an assertion, when one is expecting a conclusion from the instances given above. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">cunetse res difficiles</span>. The idea, as Motais has seen, is this - Man's life is constrained by the same law as his surroundings; he goes on his course subject to influences which he cannot control; in spite of his efforts, he can never be independent. This conclusion is developed in succeeding verses. In the present verse the proposition with which it starts is explained by what follows. All things have been the object of much labor; men have elaborately examined everything; yet the result is most unsatisfactory, the end is not reached; words cannot express it, neither eye nor ear can apprehend it. This is the view of St. Jerome, who writes, "Non solum do physicis, sed de ethicis quoque scirc difficile est. Nec sermo valet explicare causas natu-rasque rerum, nec oculus, ut rei poscit dignitas, intueri, nec auris, instituente doctore, ad summam scientiam pervenirc. Si enim nunc 'per speculum videmus in aenigmate; et ex parte cognoscimus, et ex parte prophetamus,' consequenter nec sermo potest explicate quod nescit; nec oculus in quo caecutit, aspiecre; nec auris, de quo dubitat, impleri." Delitzsch, Nowack, Wright, and others render, "All things are in restless activity;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. constant movement pervades the whole world, and yet no visible conclusion is attained. This, however true, does not seem to be the point insisted on by the author, whose intention is, as we have said, to show that man, like nature, is confined to a circle from which he cannot free himself; and though he uses all the powers with, which he is endowed to penetrate the enigma of life and to rise superior to his environments, he is wholly unable to effect anything in these matters. <span class="cmt_word">Man cannot utter it</span>. He cannot explain all things. Koheleth does not affirm that man can know nothing, that he can attain to no certitude, that reason will not teach him to apprehend any truth; his contention is that the inner cause and meaning elude his faculties, that his knowledge is concerned only with accidents and externals, and that there is still some depth which his powers cannot fathom. <span class="cmt_word">The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> Use his eight as he may, listen to the sounds around him, attend to the instructions of professed teachers, man makes no real advance in knowledge of the mysteries in which he is involved; the paradox is inexplicable. We have, in <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>, "Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and the eyes of man are never satisfied." Plumptre quotes Lucretins's expression (2. 1038)," Fessus satiate videndi." "Remember," says Thomas a Kempis ('De Imitat.,' 1:1.5), "the proverb, that the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing. Eudeavour, therefore, to withdraw thy heart from the love of visible things, and to transfer thyself to the invisible. For they that follow their sensuality do stain their conscience and lose the grace of God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">The thing that hath been, it <i>is that</i> which shall be; and that which is done <i>is</i> that which shall be done: and <i>there is</i> no new <i>thing</i> under the sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be.</span> The LXX. and the Vulgate render the first clauses of the two parts of the verse in both cases interrogatively, thus: "What is that which hath been? The very thing which shall be. And what is that which hath been done? The very thing which shall be done." What has been affirmed of phenomena in the material world is now affirmed of the events of man's life. They move in an analogous circle, whether they are concerned with actions or morals. Plumptre sees here an anticipation or a reproduction of the Stoic doctrine of a recurring cycle of events, such as Viral mentions in his fourth 'Eclogue' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo," etc.</span> But Koheleth is speaking merely from experience, and is indulging in no philosophical speculations. There is <span class="cmt_word">no new thing under the sun</span>. The Vulgate transfers this clause to the next verso, which, indeed, supports the assertion. From classical authors commentators have culled examples of the same thought. Thus Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 3:55, "Nisi forte rebus cunctis inest quidam velut orbis, ut quem ad modum temporum vices, ita morum vertantur." Seneca, 'Epist.,' 24, "Nullius rei finis est, sod in orbem nexa sunt omnia; fugiunt ac sequuntur Omnia transeunt ut revertantur, nihil novi video, nihil novi facio. Fit ali-quando et hujus rei nausea." M. Aurelius, 'Medit.,' 6:37, "He that sees the present has seen all things, both that which has Been from everlasting and that which shall Be in the future. All things are of one birth and one form." Again, 7:1, "There is nothing new; all things are common and quickly over;" 12:26, "Everything that comes to pass was always so coming to pass, and will take place again." Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' 1:57, has, perhaps, a reminiscence of this passage when he writes, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>

"Thing" is <span class="accented">dabar</span> (see on ver. 8). Septuagint, "He who shall speak and say, Behold, this is new," <span class="accented">seil</span>. Where is he?

Wright quotes Marcus Aurelius, who has much to say on this subject. Thus: cap. 2:17, "Posthumous fame is oblivion;" cap. 3:10, "Every man's life lies all within the present; for the past is spent and done with, and the future is uncertain;" cap. 4:33, "Those words which were formerly current and proper are now become obsolete and barbarous. Alas l this is not all: fame tarnishes in time, too, and men grow out of fashion as well as language. Those celebrated names of ancient story am antiquated; those of later date have the same fortune; and those of present celebrity must follow. I speak this of those who have been the wonder of their age, and shined with unusual luster; but as for the rest, they are no sooner dead than forgotten" (comp. Wisd. 2:4). (On the keen desire to live in the memory of posterity, see Ecclus. 37:26 Ecclus. 44:7, etc.)

Koheleth relates his own experience as king, in accordance with his assumption of the person of Solomon. The use of the past tense in this verse is regarded by many as strong evidence against the Solomonic authorship of the book. "I have been king" (not "I have become king," as Gratz would translate) is a statement introducing the supposed speaker, not as a reigning monarch, but as one who, in time past, exercised sovereignty. Solomon is represented as speaking from the grave, and recalling the past for the instruction of his auditors. In a similar manner, the author of the Book of Wisdom (8:1-13) speaks in his impersonation of Solomon. That king himself, who reigned without interruption to his death, could not have spoken of himself in the terms used here. He lost neither his throne nor his power; and, therefore, the expression cannot be paralleled (as Mr. Bullock suggests) by the complaint of Louis XIV., unsuccessful in war and weary of rule, "When I was king." Solomon <span class="accented">redivivus</span> is introduced to give weight to the succeeding experiences. Here is one who had every and the most favorable opportunity of seeing the best side of things; and yet his testimony is that all is vanity. In the acquisition of wisdom, the contrast between the advantage of learned leisure and the interruptions of a laborious life is set forth in Ecclus. 38:24, etc. <span class="accented">King over Israel</span>. The expression indicates a time before the division of the kingdom. We have it in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>, and occasionally elsewhere. The usual phrase is "King of Israel." (For <span class="accented">in Jerusalem</span>, see on ver. 1.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all <i>things</i> that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave my heart</span> (ver. 17; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12</a>). The heart, in the Hebrew conception, was the seat, not of the affections only, but of the understanding and intellectual faculties generally. So the expression here is equivalent to "I applied my mind." <span class="cmt_word">To seek and search out.</span> The two words are not synonymous. The former verb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, <span class="accented">darash</span>) implies penetrating into the depth of an object before one; the other word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">tur</span>) taking a comprehensive survey of matters further away; so that two methods and scopes of investigation are signified. <span class="cmt_word">By wisdom</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (Septuagint).

We have "under the sun" in ver. 9, and again in ver. 14. Here there is no question of physical matters, the phenomena of the material world, but only of human circumstances and interests. <span class="cmt_word">This sore travail</span> (rather, <span class="accented">this is a sore travail that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>God hath given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith</span>.

The same root is found in the word translated "exercised;" hence Wright has, "It is a woeful exercise which God has given to the sons of men wherewith to exercise themselves." If we <span class="accented">keep</span> to the word "travail," we may render, "to travail <span class="accented">therein</span>." It implies distracting business, engrossing occupation. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">occupationem</span>. Man feels himself constrained to make this laborious investigation, yet the result is most unsatisfactory, as the next verse shows. "God" is here <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, and so throughout the book, the name <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> (the God of the covenant, the God of Israel) never once occurring. Those who regard Solomon as the author of the book account for this on the plea that the king, in his latest years, reflecting sadly on his backsliding and fall, shrank from uttering with his polluted lips the adorable Name once so often used with filial reverence and beloved. But the true reason is found in the design of Koheleth, which was to set forth, not so much Israel's position under the covenant, as the condition of man in the face of the God of nature. The idiosyncrasies and peculiar features of the chosen people are not the subject of his essay; he deals with a wider sphere; his theme is man in his relation to Divine providence; and for this power he uses that name, common alike to the true and false religions, <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, applied to the Supreme Being by believers and idolaters.

This is intended as a confirmation of ver. 14. By the utmost exercise of his powers and faculties man cannot change the course of events; he is constantly met by anomalies which he can neither explain nor rectify (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a>). The above is probably a proverbial saying. Knobel quotes Suidas: <span class="greek">&#x3a7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate takes the whole maxim as applying only to morals: "Perverse men are hardly corrected, and the number of tools is infinite." So too the Syriac and Targum. The Septuagint rightly as the Authorized Version. The writer is not referring merely to man's sins and delinquencies, but to the perplexities in which he finds himself involved, and extrication from which is impracticable. <span class="cmt_word">That which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, "loss, defect," is <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the Old Testament. We cannot reckon where there is nothing to count; no skill in arithmetic will avail to make up for a substantial deficit. So nothing man can do is able to remedy the anomalies by which he is surrounded, or to supply the defects which are pressed upon his notice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all <i>they</i> that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Koheleth now arrives at his first conclusion, that wisdom is vanity. <span class="cmt_word">I communed with mine own heart</span>.

Who are the rulers alluded to? Solomon himself was only the second of the Israelite kings who reigned there; of the Canaanite princes who may have made that their capital, we have no knowledge, nor is R likely that Solomon would compare himself with them. The Targum has altered the approved reading, and gives, "Above all the wise men that were in Jerusalem before me." The reading, "in [instead of 'over'] Jerusalem," has indeed some manuscript authority, and is confirmed by the Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac, but it is evidently a correction of the text by critics who saw the difficulty of the authorized wording. Motais and others assert that the preposition in the Masoretic text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">all</span>, often means "in," as well as "over," when the reference is to an elevated spot; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-20.htm">Isaiah 38:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-11.htm">Hosea 11:11</a>. But even granting this, we are still uncertain who are the persons meant. Commentators point to Melchizedek, Adonizedek, and Araunah among rulers, and to Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-31.htm">1 Kings 4:31</a>) among sages. But we know nothing of the wisdom of the former, and there is no tangible reason why the latter should be designated "before me in Jerusalem." Doubtless the words point to a succession of kings who had reigned in Jerusalem, and the writer, involuntarily, perhaps, betrays his assumed character, in relying an excusable anachronism, while giving to the personated monarch a position which could not belong to the historical Solomon. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, my heart had great experience of</span> (<span class="accented">hath seen abundantly</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;</span> Venetian) <span class="cmt_word">wisdom and knowledge</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> used adverbially qualifies the word before it, "hath seen." The heart, as we have observed (ver. 13), is considered the seat of the intellectual life. In saying that the heart hath seen wisdom, the writer means that his mind has taken it in, apprehended and appropriated it (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/4-8.htm">Job 4:8</a>). <span class="accented">Wisdom and knowledge</span>; <span class="accented">chokmah</span> and <span class="accented">daath</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint), the former regarding the ethical and practical side, the latter the speculative, which leads to the other (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-6.htm">Isaiah 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I gave my heart</span>. He reiterates the expression in order to emphasize his earnestness and energy in the pursuit of wisdom. And knowing, as St. Jerome says, that "contrariis contraria inteiliguntur," he studies the opposite of wisdom, and learns the truth by contrasting it with error. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">to know madness and folly</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>). The former word, <span class="accented">holeloth</span> (intensive plural), by its etymology points to a confusion of thought, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. an unwisdom which deranges all ideas of order and propriety; and folly (hero <span class="accented">sikluth</span>), throughout the sapiential books, is identified with vice and wickedness, the contradictory of practical godliness. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "parables and knowledge," and some editors have altered the Hebrew text in accordance with this version, which they consider more suitable to the context. But Koheleth's standpoint is quite consistent. To use the words of St. Jerome in his 'Commentary,' "AEqualis studii fuit Salomoni, scire sapientiam et scientiam, et e regione errores et stultitiam, ut in aliis appetendis et aliis declinandis vera ejus sapientia probaretur." On the other hand, Den-Sirs gives a much-needed warning against touching pitch (Ecclus. 13:1), and argues expressly that "the knowledge of wickedness is not wisdom" (Ecclus. 19:22). Plumptre unnecessarily sees in the use of the term" madness 'an echo of the teaching of the Stoics, who regarded men's weaknesses as forms of insanity. The moralist had no need to travel beyond his own experience in order to learn that sin was the acme of unwisdom, a declension from reason which might well be called madness. The subject is handled by Cicero, 'Tusc. Disput.,' 3:4, 5. We are reminded of Horace's expression ('Carm.,' 2:7. 27) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Recepto Dulce mihi furere est amico."</span> And Anacreon's (31.), <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Thus far we have had Koheleth's secret thoughts - what he communed with his own heart (ver. 16). The result of his studies was most unsatisfying <span class="cmt_word">I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit</span>; or, <span class="accented">a striving after wind</span>, as ver. 14 Though the word is somewhat different. As such labor is wasted, for man cannot control issues. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">For in much wisdom <i>is</i> much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For in much wisdom is much grief.</span> The more one knows of men's lives, the deeper insight one obtains of their actions and circumstances, the greater is the cause of grief at the incomplete and unsatisfactory nature of all human affairs. <span class="cmt_word">He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow;</span> not in others, but in himself. With added experience and more minute examination, the wise man becomes more conscious of his own ignorance and impotence, of the un-sympathizing and uncontrollable course of nature, of the gigantic evils which he is powerless to remedy; this causes his sorrowful confession (ver. 17b). St. Gregory, taking the religious view of the passage, comments, "The more a man begins to know what he has lost the more he begins to bewail the sentence of his corruption, which he has met with" ('Moral.,' 18:65); and, "He that already knows the high state which he does not as yet enjoy is the more grieved for the low condition in which he is yet held" (ibid., 1:34). The statement in our text is paralleled in Ecclus. 21:12, "There is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness," and contrasted in Wisd. 8:16 with the comfort and pleasure which true wisdom brings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../proverbs/31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Proverbs 31"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Proverbs 31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/2.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/1.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 1">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 2 <a href="../ecclesiastes/3.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - Section 2. <span class="accented">Vanity of striving after pleasure and wealth</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Dissatisfied with the result of the pursuit of wisdom, Koheleth embarks on a course of sensual pleasure, if so be this may yield some effect more substantial and permanent. <span class="cmt_word">I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth.</span> The heart is addressed as the seat of the emotions and affections. The Vulgate misses the direct address to the heart, which the words, rightly interpreted, imply, translating, <span class="accented">Vadam et offluam delieiis</span>. The Septuagint correctly gives, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. It is like the rich fool's language in Christ's parable, "I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, be merry" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore enjoy pleasure;</span> literally, <span class="accented">see good</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a>). "To see" is often used figuratively in the sense of "to experience, or enjoy." Wright compares the expressions, "see death" (<a href="../../par/luke/2-26.htm">Luke 2:26</a>), "see life" (<a href="../../par/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>). We may find the like in <a href="../../par/psalms/34-13.htm">Psalm 34:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-32.htm">Jeremiah 29:32</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). The king now tries to find the <span class="accented">summum bonum</span> in pleasure, in selfish enjoyment without thought of others. Commentators, as they saw Stoicism in the first chapter, so read Epieureanism into this. We shall have occasion to refer to this idea further on (see on Ecclesiastes 3:22). Of this new experiment the result was the same as before. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, this also is vanity</span>. This experience is confirmed in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">I said of laughter, <i>It is</i> mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said of laughter, It is mad.</span> Laughter and mirth are personified, hence treated as masculine. He uses the term "mad" in reference to the statement in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>, "I gave my heart to know madness and folly." Septuagint, "I said to laughter, Error (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Risum reputavi errorem</span>. Neither of these is as accurate as the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">Of mirth, What doeth it?</span> What does it effect towards real happiness and contentment? How does it help to fill the void, to give lasting satisfaction? So we have in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a>, "Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of mirth is heaviness;" though the context is different. The Vulgate renders loosely, <span class="accented">Quid frustra deeiperis?</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what <i>was</i> that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sought in mine heart</span>; literally, <span class="accented">I spied out</span> (as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:13</a>) <span class="accented">in my heart</span>.

That is, while, as it were, experimenting with pleasure, he still retained sufficient control over his passions as not to be wholly given over to vice; he was in the position of one who is being carried down an impetuous stream, yet has the power of stopping his headlong course before it becomes fatal to him. Such control was given by wisdom. Deliberately to enter upon a course of self-indulgence, even with a possibly good intention, must be a most perilous trial, and one which would leave indelible marks upon the soul; and not one person in a hundred would be able to stop short of ruin, The historical Solomon, by his experiment, suffered infinite loss, which nothing could compensate. The Septuagint renders not very successfully, "I examined whether my heart would draw (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) my flesh as wine; and my heart guided me in wisdom." The Vulgate gives a sense entirely contrary to the writer's intention; "I thought in my heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might transfer my mind to wisdom." <span class="cmt_word">And to lay hold on folly</span>. These words are dependent upon "I sought in my heart," and refer to the sensual pleasures in which he indulged for a certain object. "Dulce est desipere in loco," says Horace ('Canto.,' 4:12. 28); <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Theognis, 313). <span class="cmt_word">Till I might see</span>.

Among these works the temple, with all its wonderful structural preparations, is not specially mentioned, perhaps because no one could think of Solomon without connecting his name with this magnificent building, and it was superfluous to call attention to it; or else because the religious aspect of his operations is not here in question, but only his taste and pursuit of beauty. But the omission tells strongly against the Solomonic authorship of the book. <span class="cmt_word">I builded me houses.</span> Solomon had a passion for erecting magnificent buildings. We have various accounts of his works of this nature in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. and 9; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8.htm">2 Chronicles 8</a>. There was the huge palace for himself, which occupied thirteen years in building; there was the "house of the forest of Lebanon," a splendid hall constructed with pillars of cedar; the porch of pillars; the hall of judgment; the harem for the daughter of Pharaoh. Then there were fortresses, store-cities, chariot-towns, national works of great importance; cities in distant lands which he founded, such as Tadmor in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">I planted me vineyards</span>. David had vineyards and olive yards (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27, 28</a>), which passed into the possession of his son; and we read in <a href="../../par/songs/8-11.htm">Song of Solomon 8:11</a> of a vineyard that Solomon had in Baal-hamon, which some identify with Belamon (Judith 8:3), a place near Shunem, in the Plain of Esdraelon.

(For the trees in such parks, see <a href="../../par/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13, 14</a>; and for an estimate of Solomon's works, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 8:07. 3.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pools of water</span>. Great care was exercised by Solomon to provide his capital with water, and vast operations were undertaken for this purpose. "The king's pool," mentioned in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-14.htm">Nehemiah 2:14</a>, may have been constructed by him (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04. 2); but the most celebrated work ascribed to him is the water-supply at Etham, southwest of Bethlehem, and the aqueduct leading from thence to Jerusalem. Most modern travelers have described these pools. They are three in number, and, according to Robinson's measurement, are of immense size. The first, to the east, is 582 feet long, 207 wide, and 50 deep; the second, 432 by 250, and 39 feet deep; the third, 380 by 236, and 25 feet deep. They are all, however, narrower at the upper end, and widen out gradually, flowing one into the other. There is a copious spring led into the uppermost pool from the north-east, but this supply is augmented by other sources now choked and ruined. The water from the pools was conveyed round the ridge on which Bethlehem stands in earthen pipes to Jerusalem. Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 326) says, "Near that city it was carried along the west side of the Valley of Gihon to the north-western end of the lower Pool of Gihon, where it crossed to the east side, and, winding round the southern declivity of Zion below <span class="accented">Neby Daud</span>, finally entered the south-eastern corner of the temple area, where the water was employed in the various services of the sanctuary." Etham is, with good reason, identified with the beautiful valley of Urtas, which lies southwest of Bethlehem, in the immediate neighborhood of the pools of Solomon. The fountain near the present village watered the gardens and orchards which were planted here, the terraced hills around were covered with vines, figs, and olives, and the prospect must have been delightful and refreshing in that thirsty land. <span class="cmt_word">To water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in order to irrigate a wood sprouting forth trees</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a nursery of saplings. So we read how the Garden of Eden was watered (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-10.htm">Genesis 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) - a most necessary feature in Eastern countries, where streams and pools are not constructed for picturesque reasons, but for material uses.

They were much more esteemed by their masters, and showed a much closer attachment to the family than the bought slaves or the conquered aboriginals, who were often reduced to this state (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20, 21</a>). The number of Solomon's attendants excited the wonder of the Queen of Sheba (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, etc.; 1 Kings 10:5), and with good reason, if Josephus's account is to be believed. This writer asserts that the king had some thousand or more chariots, and twenty thousand horses. The drivers and riders were young men of comely aspect, tall and well-made; they had long flowing hair, and wore tunics of Tyrian purple, and powdered their hair with gold dust, which glittered in the rays of the sun ('Ant.,' 8:07. 3). Attended by a cavalcade thus arrayed, Solomon used to betake himself to his "paradise" at Etham, to enjoy the refreshing coolness of its trees and pools. <span class="cmt_word">Great and small cattle</span>; <span class="accented">oxen and sheep</span>. The enormous amount of Solomon's herds and flocks is proved by the extraordinary multitude of the sacrifices at the consecration of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a>), and the lavish provision made daily for the wants of his table (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 23</a>). The cattle of David were very numerous, and required special overlookers (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-29.htm">1 Chronicles 27:29-31</a>). Job (<a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>) had, before his troubles, seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and these items were all doubled at the return of his prosperity. Among Solomon's possessions, horses are not here mentioned, though they formed no inconsiderable portion of his live stock, and added greatly to his magnificence. Koheleth, perhaps, avoided boasting of this extravagance in consideration of the religious sentiment which was strongly opposed to such a feature. <span class="cmt_word">That were in Jerusalem before me</span> (so ver. 9; see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:16</a>). But the reference here may not necessarily be to kings, but to chieftains and rich men, who were celebrated for the extent of their possessions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, <i>as</i> musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gathered me also silver and gold</span>. Much is said of the wealth of the historical Solomon, who had all his vessels of gold, armed his body-guard with golden shields, sat on an ivory throne overlaid with gold, received tribute and presents of gold from all quarters, sent his navies to distant lands to import precious metals, and made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-15.htm">2 Chronicles 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20-27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces</span>. The word rendered "the provinces" (<span class="accented">hammedinoth</span>), in spite of the article, seems to mean, not the twelve districts into which Solomon divided his kingdom for fiscal and economical purposes (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-7.htm">1 Kings 4:7</a>, etc.), but countries generally exterior to Palestine, with which he had commercial or political relations, and which sent to him the productions for which they were each most celebrated. So the districts of the Persian empire were required to furnish the monarch with a certain portion of their chief commodities. His friendship with Hiram of Tyro brought him into connection with the Phoeni-clans, the greatest commercial nation of antiquity, and through them he accumulated riches and stores from distant and various lands beyond the limits of the Mediterranean Sea. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">medinah</span>) occurs again in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:7</a> and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-14.htm">1 Kings 20:14</a>, etc.; but is found elsewhere only in exilian or post-exilian books (e.g. <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, etc.). The "kings" may be the tributary monarchs, such as those of Arabia (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15</a>); or the expression in the text may imply simply such treasure as only kings, and not private persons, could possess. <span class="cmt_word">Men-singers and women-singers.</span> These, of course, are not the choir of the temple, of which women formed no part, bur. musicians introduced at banquets and social festivals, to enhance the pleasures of the scene. They are mentioned in David's days (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>) and later (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>; Ecclus. 35:5 Ecclus. 49:1). The females who took part in these performances were generally of an abandoned class; hence the, warning of Ben-Sira, "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer, lest thou be taken with her attempts" (Ecclus. 9:4). Such exhibitions were usually accompanied with dancing, the character of which in Eastern countries is well known. The Jews, as time went on, learned to tolerate many customs and practices, imported often from other lands, which tended to lower morality and self-respect. <span class="cmt_word">And the delights of the sons of men;</span> the sensual pleasures that men enjoy. The expression is euphemistic (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/7-6.htm">Song of Solomon 7:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Musical instruments, and that of all sorts</span> (<span class="accented">shiddah veshiddoth</span>). The word (given here first in the singular number and then in the plural emphatically to express multitude) occurs nowhere else, and has, therefore, been subjected to various interpretations. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "a male cupbearer and female cupbearers;" and so the Syrian and. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Scyphos et urceos in ministerio ad vina fundenda</span> - which introduces rather a bathos into the description. After the clause immediately preceding, one might expect mention of Solomon's numerous harem (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-3.htm">1 Kings 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a>), and most modern commentators consider the word to mean "concubine," the whole expression denoting multiplicity, "wife and wives." The Authorized Version is not very probable, though somewhat supported by Kimchi, Luther, etc., and the Greek Venetian, which has, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, a musical term signifying "combination of tones," or harmony. Other interpretations are "captives," "litters," "coaches," "baths," "treasures," "chests," "demons." Ewald, followed by Motais and others, suggests that the word implies a strong or high degree of a quality, so that, connecting the two clauses together, we should render, "And in a word, all the delights of the sons of men in abundance." This seems a more appropriate termination to the catalogue than any specification of further sources of pleasure; but there is no very strong etymological reason to recommend it; and we can hardly suppose that, in the enumeration of Solomon's prodigalities, his multitudinous seraglio would be omitted. Rather it comes in here naturally as the climax and completion of his pursuit of earthly delight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So I was great</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). This refers to the magnificence and extent of his possessions and luxury, as the former passage to the surpassing excellence of his wisdom. We may compare the mention of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-13.htm">Genesis 26:13</a>), "The man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great" (<span class="accented">sc</span>. <a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Also my wisdom remained with me</span>; <span class="accented">perseveravit mecum</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (Septuagint). In accordance with the purpose mentioned in ver. 3, he retained command of himself, studying philosophically the effects and nature of the pleasures of which he partook, and keeping ever in view the object of his pursuit. Voluptuousness was not the end which he sought, but one of the means to obtain the end; and what he calls his wisdom is not pure Divine wisdom that comes from above, but an earthly prudence and self-restraint.

This term "portion" (<span class="accented">cheleq</span>) recurs often (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, ver. 21; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>, etc.; so Wisd. 2:9) in the sense of the result obtained by labor or con-duet. And what a meagre and unsatisfying result it was which he gained! Contrast the apostle's teaching, "All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the vain-glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16, 17</a>).

He examined carefully the effects of the conduct and proceedings mentioned in vers. 1-10, and he now gives his matured judgment concerning them. They had contributed nothing to his anxious inquiry for man's real good. His sorrowful conclusion again is that all was vanity, a hunting of wind; in all the pursuits and labors that men undertake there is no real profit (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:3</a>), no lasting happiness, nothing to satisfy the cravings of the spirit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what <i>can</i> the man <i>do</i> that cometh after the king? <i>even</i> that which hath been already done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-26.</span> - Section 3. <span class="accented">Vanity of wisdom</span>, <span class="accented">in view of the fate that awaits the wise man equally with the fool</span>, <span class="accented">and the uncertainty of the future of his labors</span>, <span class="accented">especially as man is not master of his own fate</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>). He studied the three in their mutual connection and relation, comparing them in their results and effects on man's nature and life, and deducing thence their real value. On one side he set wisdom, on the other the action, and habits which he rightly terms "madness and folly," and examined them calmly and critically. <span class="cmt_word">For what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done</span>. Both the Authorized Version and Revised Version render the passage thus, though the latter, in the margin, gives two alternative renderings of the second clause, viz. <span class="accented">even him whom they made king long ago</span>, and, as in the Authorized Version margin, in <span class="accented">those things which have been already done</span>. The LXX., following a different reading, gives, "For what man is there who will follow after counsel in whatsoever things he employed it?" Vulgate, "What is man, said I, that he should be able to follow the King, his Maker?" Wright, Delitzsch, Nowack, etc., "For what is the man that is to come after the king whom they made so long ago?" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who can have greater experience than Solomon made king in old time amid universal acclamation (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>)? or, who can hope to equal his fame? - which does not seem quite suitable, as it is the abnormal opportunities of investigation given by his unique position which would be the point of the query. The Authorized Version gives a fairly satisfactory (and grammatically unobjectionable) meaning - What can any one effect who tries the same experiment as the king did? He could not do so under more favorable conditions, and will only repeat the same process and reach the same result. But the passage is obscure, and every interpretation has its own difficulty. If the <span class="accented">ki</span> with which the second portion of the passage begins ("for what," etc.) assigns the reason or motive of the first portion, shows what was the design of Koheleth in contrasting wisdom and folly, the rendering of the Authorized Version is not inappropriate. Many critics consider that Solomon is here speaking of his successor, asking what kind of man he will be who comes after him - the man whom some have already chosen? And certainly there is some ground for this interpretation in vers. 18, 19, where the complaint is that all the king's greatness and glory will be left to an unworthy successor. But this view requires the Solomonic authorship of the book, and makes him to refer to Rehoboam or some illegitimate usurper. The wording of the text is too general to admit of this explanation; nor does it exactly suit the immediate context, or duly connect the two clauses of the verse. It seems best to take the successor, not as one who comes to the kingdom, but as one who pursues similar investigations, repeats Koheleth's experiments.

With all his experience, he could only conclude that in one important aspect the observed superiority of wisdom to folly was illusory and vain. He saw with his own eyes, and needed no instructor to teach, that both wise and fool must succumb to death, the universal leveler.

And how dieth the wise <i>man</i>? as the fool.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool forever</span>; Revised Version, more emphatically, for <span class="accented">of the wise man</span>, <span class="accented">even as of the fool</span>, <span class="accented">there is no remembrance forever</span>. This, of course, is not absolutely true. There are men whose names are history, and will endure  as long as the world lasts; but speaking generally, oblivion is the portion of all; posterity soon forgets the wisdom of one and the folly of another. Where the belief in the future life was not a strong and animating motive, posthumous fame exercised a potent attraction for many minds. To be the founder of a long line of descendants, -r to leave a record which should be fresh in the minds of future generations, these were objects of intense ambition, and valued as worthy of highest aspirations and best efforts. The words of classical poets will occur to our memory; e.g. Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:30. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Exegi monumentum aere perennius...<br />Non omnis metier, multaque pars mei<br />Vitabit Libitinam."</span> Ovid, '<span class="accented">Amor</span>.,' 1:15. 4 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ergo etiam, cum me supremus adederit ignis,<br />Vivam, parsquc mei multa supersteserit."</span> But Koheleth shows the vanity of all such hopes; they are based on sounds which experience proves to be unsubstantial. Though Solomon's own fame gives the lie to the statement received without limitation (comp. Wisd. 8:13), yet his reflections might well have taken this turn, and the writer is quite justified in putting the thought into his mouth, as the king could not know how subsequent ages would regard his wisdom and attainments. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten</span>. The clause has been variously translated. Septuagint, "Forasmuch as the coming days, even all the things, are forgotten;" Vulgate, "And future times shall cover all things equally with oblivion." Modern editors give, "Since in the days that are to come they are all forgotten;" "As in time past, so in days to come, all will be forgotten.... In the days which are coming [it will be said by-and-by], The whole of them are long ago forgotten.'" This is a specimen of the uncertainty of exact interpretation, where the intended meaning is well ascertained. "<span class="accented">All"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span>) may refer either to wise and foolish, or to the circumstances of their lives. <span class="cmt_word">And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.</span> Better taken as one sentence, with an exclamation, <span class="accented">How doth the wise man die with</span> (<span class="accented">even</span> as) <span class="accented">the fool I</span> (For "with" (<span class="accented">ira</span>), equivalent to "as," comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-26.htm">Job 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-6.htm">Psalm 106:6</a>.) "How" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;</span>) is sarcastic, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>, or sorrowful, as <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>. The same complaint falls from a psalmist's lips, "He seeth that wise men die; the fool and the brutish together <span class="accented">perish"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>). So David laments the death of the murdered leader, "Should Abner die as a fool dieth?" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>). Plumptre considers that the author of the Book of Wisdom expands this view with the design of exposing its fallacy, and introducing a better hope (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:1-9</a>). But that writer would not have designated Solomon's sentiments as those of "<span class="accented">the</span> ungodly" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>), nor foisted these utterances of sensualists and materialists upon so honored a source. At the same time, it is only as being victims, <span class="accented">nil miserantis Opel</span>, the prey of the pitiless and indiscriminating grave, that the wise and foolish are placed in the same category. There is the widest difference between the death-beds of the two, as the experience of any one who has watched them will testify, the one happy with the consciousness of duty done honestly, however imperfectly, and bright with the hope of immortality; the other darkened by vain regrets and shrinking despair, or listless in brutish insensibility.

The bitter complaint of Job (<a href="../../par/job/3-20.htm">Job 3:20</a>, etc.; Job 6:8, 9) is here echoed, though the words do not point to suicide as the solution of the riddle. It is the <span class="accented">ennui</span> and unprofitableness of all life and action in view of the inevitable conclusion, which is here lamented. <span class="cmt_word">Because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for evil unto me</span> (<a href="../../par/esther/3-9.htm">Esther 3:9</a>) <span class="accented">is the work which is done under the sun</span>.

The apostle teaches a 'better lesson, and the worker who adopts his rule is saved from this crushing disappointment: "<span class="accented">Whatsoever</span> ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For all is vanity.</span> He comes back to the same miserable refrain; it is all emptiness, striving after wind.

It is impossible that Solomon could thus have spoken of Rehoboam; and to suppose that he wrote thus after Jeroboam's attempt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>, etc.), and in contemplation of a possible usurper, is not warranted by any historical statement, the absolute security of the succession being all along expected, and the growing discontent being perfectly unknown to, or contemptuously disregarded by, the king.

The bitter feeling that he has to leave the fruits of his lifelong labor to another is aggravated by the thought that he knows not the character of this successor, whether he will be worthy or not. As the psalmist says, "He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them" (<a href="../../par/psalms/39-6.htm">Psalm 39:6</a>). Again in the parable, "The things which thou hast prepared, whose shall they be?" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20</a>; comp.

The author speaks of himself objectively, as St. Paul (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>) says, "I know a man in Christ," etc. His complaint now is, not that his successor may misuse his inheritance (ver. 19), but that this person shall have that on which he has bestowed no skill or toil, shall enjoy what modern phraseology terms "unearned increment." This, which was set forth as One of the blessings of the promised land (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10, 11</a>), Koheleth cannot bear to contemplate where it touches himself - not from envy or grudging, but from the feeling of dissatisfaction and want of energy which it generates. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> (<span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>knowledge and in</span> (<span class="accented">with</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>equity</span>. <span class="accented">Kishron</span>, translated "equity" in the Authorized Version; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> "manliness," in the Septuagint: and <span class="accented">sollicitudine</span> in the Vulgate, seems rather here to signify "skill" or "success."

These are the real results of his lifelong efforts. All his days are pains and sorrows, bring trouble with them, and all his labor ends in grief. "Sorrows" and "grief" are pretreated respectively of "days" and "travail." Abstract nouns are often so used. Thus <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:12</a>, "The words of a wise man's mouth are grace."

The Vulgate makes the sentence interrogative, which the Hebrew does not sanction, <span class="accented">Nonne melius est comedere et bibere</span>? Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "There is naught good to a man to eat or drink;" St. Jerome and others insert <span class="accented">misi</span>, "except for a man to eat," etc. This and the Authorized Version, which are more or less approved by most critics, make the writer enunciate a kind of modified Epicureanism, quotations in confirmation of which will be found set forth by Plumptre. It is not pretended that the present Hebrew text admits this exposition, and critics have agreed to modify the original in order to express the sense which they give to the passage. As it stands, the sentence runs, "It is not good in (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;</span>) man that he should eat," etc. This is supposed to clash with later statements; e.g. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>; and to condemn all bodily pleasure even in its simplest form. Hence commentators insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> ("than") before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, supposing that the initial mere has dropped out after the terminal of the preceding word, <span class="accented">adam</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>). This solution of a difficulty might be allowed were the Hebrew otherwise incapable of explanation without doing violence to the sentiments elsewhere expressed. But this is not the case. As Metals has seen, the great point lies in the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>, and what is stated is that it does not depend on man, it is not in his power, he is not at liberty to eat and drink and enjoy himself simply at his own will; his power and ability proceed wholly from God. A higher authority than his decides the matter. The phrase, "to eat and drink," is merely a periphrasis for living in comfort, peace, and affluence. St. Gregory, who holds that here and in other places Koheleth seems to contradict himself, makes a remark which is of general application, "He who looks to the text, and does not acquaint himself with the sense of the Holy Word, is not so much furnishing himself with instruction as bewildering himself in uncertainty, in that the literal words sometimes contradict themselves; but whilst by their oppositeness they stand at variance with themselves, they direct the reader to a truth that is to be understood" ('Moral.,' 4:1). They who read Epicureanism into the text fall into the error here denounced. They take the expression, "eat and drink," in the narrowest sense of bodily pleasure, whereas it was by no means so confined in the mind of a Hebrew. To eat bread in the kingdom of God, to take a place at the heavenly banquet, represents the highest bliss of glorified man (<a href="../../par/luke/14-15.htm">Luke 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, etc.). In a lower degree it signifies earthly prosperity, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>, "Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? then it was well with him." So in our passage we find only the humiliating truth that man in himself is powerless to make his life happy or his labors successful. There is no Epicurean-ism, even in a modified form, in the Hebrew text as it has come down to us. With other supposed traces of this philosophy we shall have to deal subsequently (see on Ecclesiastes 3:12; 6:2). <span class="cmt_word">And that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. taste the enjoyment of his labor, get pleasure as the reward of all his exertions, or find it in the actual pursuit. <span class="cmt_word">This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God</span>. This is the point - the power of enjoyment depends on the will of God. The next verse substantiates this assertion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-25.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">For who can eat, or who else can hasten <i>hereunto</i>, more than I?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</span> This is the translation of the received text. "Eat" means enjoy one's self, as in the preceding verse; "hasten hereunto" implies eager pursuit of pleasure; and Koheleth asks - Who had better opportunity than he for verifying the principle that all depends upon the gift of God? Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quis ita devorabit</span>, <span class="accented">et deliciis affluet ut ego?</span> The Septuagint had a different reading, which obtains also in the Syriac and Arabic versions, and has been adopted by many modern critics. Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, they read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "without him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. except from God. "For who shall eat or who shall drink without him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> This merely repeats the thought of the last verse, in agreement with the saying of St. James (James 1:17), "Every good gift and every perfect boon is from above, coming down from the Father' of lights." But the received reading, if it admits the rendering of the Authorized Version (which is somewhat doubtful), stands in close connection with the personal remark just preceding, "This also I saw," etc., and is a more sensible confirmation thereof than a tautological observation can be. The next verse carries on the thought that substantial enjoyment is entirely the gift of God, and granted by him as the moral Governor of the world.

So in the parable of the talents, the talent of the unprofitable servant is given unto him who had made best use of his money (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-28.htm">Matthew 25:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This also is vanity</span>. It is a question what is the reference here. Delitzsch considers it to be the striving after pleasure in and from labor (ver. 24); Knobel, the arbitrary distribution of the good things of this life; but, put thus baldly, this could hardly be termed a "feeding on wind;" nor could that expression be applied to the "gifts of God" to which Bullock confines the reference. Wright, Hengstenberg, Gratz, and others deem that what is meant is the collecting and heaping up of riches by the sinner, which has already been decided to be vanity (vers. 11, 17, 18); and this Would limit the general conclusion to a particular instance. Taking the view contained in ver. 24 as the central idea of the passage, we see that Koheleth feels that the restriction upon man's enjoyment of labor imposed by God's moral government makes that toil vain because its issue is not in men's hands, and it is a striving for or a feeding on wind because the result is unsatisfying and vanishes in the grasp. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/3.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/2.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 2">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 3 <a href="../ecclesiastes/4.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">To every <i>thing there is</i> a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-22.</span> - Section 4. In confirmation of the truth that man's happiness depends upon the will of God, Koheleth proceeds to show how <span class="accented">Providence arranges even the minutest concerns</span>; <span class="accented">that man can alter nothing</span>, <span class="accented">must make the best of things as they are</span>, <span class="accented">bear with anomalies</span>, <span class="accented">bounding his desires by this present life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - The providence of God disposes and arranges every detail of man's life. This proposition is stated first generally, and then worked out in particular by means of antithetical sentences. In Hebrew manuscripts and most printed texts vers. 2-8 are arranged in two parallel columns, so that one "time" always stands under another. A similar arrangement is found in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-9.htm">Joshua 12:9</a>, etc., containing the catalogue of the conquered Canaanite kings; and in <a href="../../par/esther/9-7.htm">Esther 9:7</a>, etc., giving the names of Haman's tensions. In the present passage we have fourteen pairs of contrasts, ranging from external circumstances to the inner affections of man's being. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To every thing there is u season, and a time to every purpose under heaven</span>. . "Season" and "time" are rendered by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The word for "season" (<span class="accented">zeman</span>), denotes a fixed, definite portion of time; while <span class="accented">eth</span>, "<span class="accented">time</span>," signifies rather the beginning of a period, or is used as a general appellation. The two ideas are sometimes concurrent in the New Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>, where the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; and <a href="../../par/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, where we find the singular <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in Theodotion, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the Septuagint). So in Wisd. 8:8, "wisdom to foreseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons and times (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." <span class="accented">Every thing</span> refers especially to men's movements and actions, and to what concerns them. <span class="accented">Purpose</span>; <span class="accented">chephets</span>, originally meaning "delight," "pleasure," in the later Hebrew came to signify "<span class="accented">business</span>," "thing," "<span class="accented">matter</span>." The proposition is - In human affairs Providence arranges the moment when everything shall happen, the duration of its operation, and the time appropriate thereto. The view of the writer takes in the whole circumstances of men's life from its commencement to its close. But the thought is not, as some have opined, that there is naught but uncertainty, fluctuation, and imperfection in human affairs, nor, as Plumptre conceives, "It is wisdom to do the right thing at the right time, that inopportuneness is the bane of life," for many of the circumstances mentioned, e.g. birth and death, are entirely beyond men's will and control, and the maxim, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span>, cannot apply to man in such cases. Kobeleth is confirming his assertion, made in the last chapter, that wisdom, wealth, success, happiness, etc., are not in man's hands, that his own efforts can secure none of them - they are distributed at the will of God. He establishes this dictum by entering into details, and showing the ordering of Providence and the supremacy of God in all men's concerns, the most trivial as well as the most important. The Vulgate gives a paraphrase, and not a very exact one, <span class="accented">Omnia tempus habeat</span>, <span class="accented">et</span> suis <span class="accented">spatiis transenat universa sub caelo</span>. Koheleth intimates, without attempting to reconcile, the great <span class="accented">crux</span> of man's free-will and God's decree. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up <i>that which is</i> planted;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to be born, and a time to die.</span> Throughout the succeeding catalogue marked contrasts are exhibited in pairs, beginning with the entrance and close of life, the rest of the list being occupied with events and circumstances which intervene between those two extremities. The words rendered, "a time to be born," might more naturally mean "<span class="accented">a</span> time to bear;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint; as the verb is in the infinitive active, which, in this particular verb, is not elsewhere found used in the passive sense, though other verbs are so used sometimes, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-34.htm">Jeremiah 25:34</a>. In the first case the catalogue commences with the beginning of life; in the second, with the season of full maturity: "Those who at one time give life to others, at another have themselves to yield to the law of death" (Wright). The contrast points to the passive rendering. There is no question of untimely birth or suicide; in the common order of events birth and death have each their appointed season, which comes to pass without man's interference, being directed by a higher law. "It is appointed unto men once to die" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). Koheleth's teaching was perverted by sensualists, as we read in Wisd. 2:2, 3, 5. <span class="cmt_word">A time to plant.</span> After speaking of human life it is natural to turn to vegetable life, which runs in parallel lines with man's existence. Thus Job, having intimated the shortness of life and the certainty of death, proceeds to speak of the tree, contrasting its revivifying powers with the <span class="accented">hopelessness</span> of man's decay (<a href="../../par/job/14-5.htm">Job 14:5</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And to pluck up that which is planted</span>. This last operation may refer to the transplanting of trees and shrubs, or to the gathering of the fruits of the earth in order to make room for new agricultural works. But having regard to the opposition in all the members of the series, we should rather consider the "plucking up" as equivalent to destroying, if we plant trees, a time comes when we cut them down, and this is their final cause. Some commentators see in this clause an allusion to the settling and uprooting of kingdoms and nations, as <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-9.htm">Jeremiah 18:9</a>. etc. but this could not have been the idea in Koheleth's mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to kill, and a time to heal</span>. The time to kill might refer to war, only that occurs in ver. 8. Some endeavor to limit the notion to severe surgical operations performed with a view of saving life; but the verb <span class="accented">harag</span> does not admit of the meaning "rewound" or" cut." It most probably refers to the execution of criminals, or to the defense of the oppressed; such emergencies and necessities occur providentially without man's prescience. So sickness is <span class="accented">a visitation</span> beyond man's control, while it calls into exercise the art of healing, which is a gift of God (see Ecclus. 10:10 Ecclus. 38:1, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">A time to break down, and a time to build up</span>. The removal of decaying or unsuitable buildings is meant, and the substitution of new and improved structures. A recollection of Solomon's own extensive architectural works is here introduced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to weep, and a time to laugh</span>, grouped naturally with <span class="cmt_word">a time to mourn, and a time to dance</span>. The funeral and the wedding, the hired mourners and the guests at the marriage-feast, are set against one another. The first clause intimates the spontaneous manifestation of the feelings of the heart; the second, their formal expression in the performances at funerals and weddings and on other solemn occasions. The contrast is found in the Lord's allusion to the sulky children in the market-place, who would not join their companions' play: "We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented" (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-17.htm">Matthew 11:17</a>). Dancing sometimes accompanied religious sere-monies, as when David brought up the ark (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14, 16</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together.</span> There is no question about building or demolishing houses, as that has been already mentioned in ver. 3. Most commentators see an allusion to the practice of marring an enemy's fields by casting stones upon them, as the Israelites did when they invaded Moab (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19, 25</a>). But this must have been a very abnormal proceeding, and could scarcely be cited as a usual occurrence. Nor is the notion more happy that there is an allusion to the custom of flinging stones or earth into the grave at a burial - a Christian, but not an ancient Jewish practice; this, too, leaves the contrasted "gathering" unexplained. Equally inappropriate is the opinion that the punishment of stoning is meant, or some game played with pebbles. It seems most simple to see herein intimated the operation of clearing a vineyard of stones, as mentioned in <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; and of collecting materials for making fences, wine-press, tower, etc., and repairing roads. <span class="cmt_word">A time to embrace.</span> Those who explain the preceding clause of the marring and clearing of fields connect the following one with the other by conceiving that "the loving action of embracing stands beside the hostile, purposely injurious, throwing of stones into a field" (Delitzsch). It is plain that there are times when one may give himself up to the delights of love and friendship, and times when such distractions would be incongruous and unseasonable, as on solemn, penitential occasions (<a href="../../par/joel/2-16.htm">Joel 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>); but the congruity of the two clauses of the couplet is not obvious, unless the objectionable position of stones and their advantageous employment are compared with the character of illicit (<a href="../../par/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>) and legitimate love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to get</span> (seek), <span class="cmt_word">and a time to lose</span>. The verb <span class="accented">abad</span>, in piel, is used in the sense of "to destroy" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>), and it is only in late Hebrew that it signifies, as here, "to lose." The reference is doubtless to property, and has no connection with the last clause of the preceding verse, as Delitzsch would opine. There is a proper and lawful pursuit of wealth, and there is a wise and prudent submission to its inevitable loss. The loss here is occasioned by events over which the owner has no control, differing from that in the next clause, which is voluntary. The wise man knows when to exert his energy in improving his fortune, and when to hold his hand and take failure without useless struggle. Loss, too, is sometimes gain, as when Christ's departure in the flesh was the prelude and the occasion of the sending of the Comforter (<a href="../../par/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>); and there are many things of which we know not the real value till they are beyond our grasp. <span class="cmt_word">A time to keep, and a time to cast away.</span> Prudence will make fast what it has won, and will endeavor to preserve it unimpaired. But there are occasions when it is wiser to deprive one's self of some things in order to secure more important ends, as when sailors throw a cargo, etc., overboard in order to save their ship (comp. <a href="../../par/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-18.htm">Acts 27:18, 19, 38</a>). And in higher matters, such as almsgiving, this maxim holds good: "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth.... The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be watered also himself" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24, 25</a>). Plumptre refers to Christ's so-called paradox," Whosoever would (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span>) save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-25.htm">Matthew 16:25</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a></div><div class="verse">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to rend, and a time to sew</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). This is usually understood of the rending of garments in token of grief (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-29.htm">Genesis 37:29, 34</a>, etc.), and the repairing of the rent then made when the season of mourning was ended. The Talmudists laid down careful rules concerning the extent of the ritual tear, and how long it was to remain unmended, both being regulated by the nearness of the relationship of the deceased person. In this interpretation there are these two difficulties: first, it makes the clause a virtual repetition of ver. 4; and secondly, it is not known for certain that the closing of the rent was a ceremonial custom in the times of Koheleth. Hence Plumptre inclines to take the expression metaphorically of the division of a kingdom by schism, and the restoration of unity, comparing the Prophet Ahijah's communication to Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30, 31</a>). But surely this would be a most unlikely allusion to put into Solomon's mouth; nor can we properly look for such a symbolical representation amid the other realistic examples given in the series. What Koheleth says is this - There are times when it is natural to tear clothes to pieces, whether from grief, or anger, or any other cause, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> being old and worthless, or infected; and there are times when it is equally natural to mend them, and to make them serviceable by timely repairs. Connected with the notion of mourning contributed by this clause, though by no means confined to that notion, it is added, <span class="cmt_word">A time to keep silence, and a time to speak</span>. The silence of deep sorrow may be intimated, as when Job's friends sat by him in sympathizing silence (<a href="../../par/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>), and the psalmist cried, "I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred" (<a href="../../par/psalms/39-2.htm">Psalm 39:2</a>); and Elisha could not bear to hear his master's departure mentioned (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3, 5</a>). There are also occasions when the sorrow of the heart should find utterance, as in David's lament over Saul and Jonathan (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17</a>, etc.) and over Abner (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-33.htm">2 Samuel 3:33</a>, etc.). But the gnome is of more general application. The young should hold their peace in the presence of their elders (<a href="../../par/job/32-4.htm">Job 32:4</a>, etc.); silence is often golden: "Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/17-28.htm">Proverbs 17:28</a>). On the other hand, wise counsel is of infinite value, and must not be withheld at the right moment, and "a word in due season, how good is it!" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>). "If thou hast understanding, answer thy neighbor; if not, lay thy hand upon thy mouth" (Ecclus. 5:12; see more, Ecclus. 20:5, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A time to love, and a time to hate.</span> This reminds one of the gloss to which our Lord refers (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43</a>), "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy," the first member being found in the old Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>), the second being a misconception of the spirit which made Israel God's executioner upon the condemned nations. It was the maxim of Bias, quoted by Aristotle, 'Rhet.,' 2:13, that we should love as if about some day to hate, and hate as if about to love. And Philo imparts a still more selfish tone to the gnome, when he pronounces ('De Carit.,' 21, p. 401, Mang.), "It was well said by them of old, that we ought to deal out friendship without absolutely renouncing enmity, and practice enmity as possibly to turn to friendship. <span class="cmt_word">A time of war, and a time of peace.</span> In the previous couplets the infinitive mood of the verb has been used; in this last hemistich substantives are introduced, as being more concise and better fitted to emphasize the close of the catalogue. The first clause referred specially to the private feelings which one is constrained to entertain towards individuals. The second clause has to do with national concerns, and touches on the statesmanship which discovers the necessity or the opportuneness of war and peace, and acts accordingly. In this and in all the other examples adduced, the lesson intended is this - that man is not independent; that under all circumstances and relations he is in the hand of a power mightier than himself, which frames time and seasons according to its own good pleasure. God holds the threads of human life; in some mysterious way directs and controls events; success and failure are dependent upon his will. There are certain laws which, regulate the issues of actions and events, and man cannot alter these; his free-will can put them in motion, but they become irresistible when in operation. This is not fatalism; it is the mere statement of a fact in experience. Koheleth never denies man's liberty, though he is very earnest in asserting God's sovereignty. The reconciliation of the two is a problem unsolved by him.

This travail, exercise, or business is the work that has to be done under the conditions prescribed of time and season in face of the difficulty of man's free action and God's ordering. We take infinite pains, we entertain ample desires, and strive restlessly to carry them out, but our efforts are controlled by a higher law, and results occur in the way and at the time arranged by Providence. Human labor, though it is appointed by God and is part of man's heritage imposed upon him by the Fall (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17</a>, etc.), cannot bring contentment or satisfy the spirit's cravings.

All parts of this have, in God's design, a beauty and a harmony, their own season for appearance and development, their work to do in carrying on the majestic march of Providence. <span class="cmt_word">Also</span> <span class="cmt_word">he hath set the world in their heart.</span> "The world;" <span class="accented">eth-haolam</span>, placed (as <span class="accented">haeol</span> above) before the verb, with <span class="accented">eth</span>, to emphasize the relation. There is some uncertainty in the translation of this word. The LXX. <span class="accented">has</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mundum tradidit disputationi eorum</span>. The original meaning is "the hidden," and it is used generally in the Old Testament of the remote past, and sometimes of the future, as Daniel 3:33 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>Daniel 4:3<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>, so that the idea conveyed is of unknown duration, whether the glance looks backward or forward, which is equivalent to our word "eternity." It is only in later Hebrew that the word obtained the signification of "age" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), or "world" in its relation to time. Commentators who have adopted the latter sense here explain the expression as if it meant that man in himself is a microcosm, a little world, or that the love of the world, the love of life, is naturally implanted in him. But taking the term in the signification found throughout the Bible, we are justified in translating it "eternity." The pronoun in "their heart" refers to "the sons of men" in the previous verse. God has put into men's minds a notion of infinity of duration; the beginning and the end of things are alike beyond his grasp; the time to be born and the time to die are equally unknown and uncontrollable. Koheleth is not thinking of that hope of immortality which his words unfold to us with our better knowledge; he is speculating on the innate faculty of looking backward and forward which man possesses, but which is insufficient to solve the problems which present themselves every day. This conception of eternity may be the foundation of great hopes and expectations, but as an explanation of the ways of Providence it fails. <span class="cmt_word">So that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end</span>; or, <span class="accented">without man being able to penetrate</span>; <span class="accented">yet so that he cannot</span>, etc. Man sees only minute parts of the great whole; he cannot comprehend all at one view, cannot understand the law that regulates the time and season of every circumstance in the history of man and the world. He feels that, as there has been an infinite past, there will be an infinite future, which may solve anomalies and demonstrate the harmonious unity of God's design, and he must be content to wait and hope. Comparison of the past with the present may help to adumbrate the future, but is inadequate to unravel the complicated thread of the world's history (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16, 17</a>, and Ecclesiastes 9:1, where a similar thought is expressed). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12</a></div><div class="verse">I know that <i>there is</i> no good in them, but for <i>a man</i> to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I knew</span>, <span class="accented">perceived</span>, <span class="accented">that there was no good for them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for men. From the facts adduced, Koheleth learned this practical result - that man had nothing in his own power (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24) which would conduce to his happiness, but to make the best of life such as he finds it. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Cognovi quod non esset melius nisi laetari</span>. <span class="cmt_word">To do good in his life</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Facere bene</span> (Vulgate). This has been taken by many in the sense of "doing one's self good, prospering, enjoying one's self." like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and therefore nearly equivalent to "rejoice" in the former part of the verse. But the expression is best taken here, as when it occurs elsewhere (e.g. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a>), in a moral sense, and it thus teaches the great truth that virtue is essential to happiness, that to "trust in the Lord... to depart from evil, and to do good" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-3.htm">Psalm 36:3</a>, 27), will bring peace and content (see in the epilogue, <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14</a>). There is no Epicureanism in this verse; the enjoyment spoken of is not licentiousness, but a happy appreciation of the innocent pleasures which the love of God offers to those who live in accordance with the laws of their higher nature. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a></div><div class="verse">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it <i>is</i> the gift of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And also that every man should eat and drink... it is the gift of God.</span> This enforces and intensifies the statement in the preceding verse; not only the power to "do good," but even to enjoy what comes in his way (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24), man must receive from God. When we pray for our daily bread, we also ask for ability to take, assimilate, and profit by the supports and comforts afforded to us. "It" is better omitted, as "is the gift of God" forms the predicate of the sentence. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11.htm">Ecclesiastes 11</a>:17, "The gift of the Lord remaineth with the godly, and his favor bringeth prosperity for ever."

We cannot hasten or retard God's designs; we cannot add to or curtail his plans. Septuagint, "It is impossible to add (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) to it, and it is impossible to Lake away from it." Thus Ecclus. 18:6, "As for the wondrous works of the Lord, it is impossible to lessen or to add to them (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), neither can the ground of them be found out." <span class="cmt_word">God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</span> There is a moral purpose in this disposal of events. Men feel this uniformity and unchangeableness in the working of Providence, and thence learn to cherish a reverential awe for the righteous government of which they are the subjects. It was this feeling which led ancient etymologists to derive <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="accented">Deus</span> from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "fear" (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3, 4</a>). This is also a ground of hope and confidence. Amid the jarring and fluctuating circumstances of men God holds the threads, and alters not his purpose. "I the Lord change not; therefore ye, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed" (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The Vulgate is not very successful: <span class="accented">Non</span> <span class="accented">possumus eis quid-quam addere</span>, <span class="accented">nec auferre</span>, <span class="accented">quae fecit Deus ut timeatur</span>, "We cannot add anything unto, or take anything away from, those things which God hath made that he may be feared."

The thought is much the same as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a>, only here it is adduced not to prove the vanity and endless sameness of circumstances, but the orderly and appointed succession of events under the controlling providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">That which is to be hath already been</span>. The future will be a reproduction of the past. The laws which regulate things change not; the moral government is exercised by him who "is, and was, and is to come" (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>), and therefore in effect history repeats itself; the same causes produce the same phenomena. <span class="cmt_word">God requireth that which is past</span>; literally, <span class="accented">God seeketh after that which hath been chased away</span>; Septuagint, "God will seek him who is pursued (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>);" Vulgate, "God reneweth that which is passed (<span class="accented">instaurat quod abiit</span>)." The meaning is - God brings back to view, recalls again into being, that which was past and had vanished out of sight and mind. The sentence is an explanation of the preceding clauses, and has nothing to do with the inquisition at the day of judgment. Hengstenberg has followed the Septuagint, Syriac, and Targum, in translating, "God seeks the persecuted," and seeing herein an allusion to the punishment of the Egyptians for pursuing the Israelites to the Red Sea, or a general statement that God succors the oppressed. But this idea is quite alien to the intention of the passage, and injures the coherence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, <i>that</i> wickedness <i>was</i> there; and the place of righteousness, <i>that</i> iniquity <i>was</i> there.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-22.</span> - Acknowledging the providential government of God, which controls events and places man's happiness out of his own power, one is confronted also by the fact that there is much wickedness, much injustice, in the world, which oppose all plans for peaceful enjoyment. Doubtless there shall be a day of retribution for such iniquities; and God allows them now in order to try men and to teach them humility. Meantime man's duty and happiness consist, as before said, in making the best use of the present and improving the opportunities which God gives him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment</span>. Koheleth records his experience of the prevalence of iniquity in high places. <span class="accented">The place of judgment</span> (<span class="accented">mishat</span>); where justice is administered. The accentuation allows (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>) this to be regarded as the object of the verb. The Revised Version, with Hitzig, Ginsburg, and others, take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> as an adverbial expression equivalent to "in the place." The former is the simpler construction. "And moreover," at the commencement of the verse, looks back to ver. 10," I have seen the travail," etc. That <span class="cmt_word">wickedness</span> (<span class="accented">resha</span>) was there. On the judicial seat iniquity sat instead of justice. <span class="cmt_word">The place of righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">tsedek</span>). "Righteousness" is the peculiar characteristic of the judge himself, as "justice" is of his decisions. <span class="cmt_word">That iniquity</span> (<span class="accented">resha</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was there</span>. The word ought to be translated "wickedness" or "iniquity" in both clauses. The Septuagint takes the abstract for the concrete, and at the end has apparently introduced a clerical error, which has been perpetuated in the Arabic and elsewhere, "And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there was the ungodly (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>); and the place of the righteous, there was the <span class="accented">godly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Complutensian Polyglot reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> in both places. It is impossible to harmonize these statements of oppression and injustice here and elsewhere (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:9, 10</a>) with Solomon's authorship of the book. It is contrary to fact that such a corrupt state of things existed in his time, and in writing thus he would be uttering a libel against himself. If he was cognizant of such evils in his kingdom, he had nothing to do but to put them down with a high hand. There is nothing to lead to the belief that he is speaking of other countries and other times; he is stating his own personal experience of what goes on around him. It is true that in Solomon's latter days disaffection secretly prevailed, and the people felt his yoke grievous (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>); but there is no evidence of the existence of corruption in judicial courts, or of the social and political evils of which he speaks in this book. That he had a prophetical for, sight of the disasters that would accompany the reign of his successor, and endeavors herein to provide consolation for the future sufferers, is a pious opinion without historical basis, and cannot be justly used to support the genuineness of the work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for <i>there is</i> a time there for every purpose and for every work.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked</span>. In view of the injustice that prevails in earthly tribunals, Koheleth takes comfort in the thought that there is retribution in store for every man. when God shall award sentence according to deserts. God is a righteous Judge strong and patient, and his decisions are infallible. Future judgment is here plainly stated, as it is at the final conclusion (Ecclesiastes 11:14). They who refuse to credit the writer with belief in this great doctrine resort to the theory of interpolation and alteration in order to account for the language in this and analogous <span class="accented">passages</span>. There can be no doubt that the present text has hitherto always been regarded as genuine, and that it does clearly assert future retribution, though not so much as a conclusion firmly established, but rather as a belief which may explain anomalies and afford comfort under trying <span class="accented">circumstances</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</span> The adverb rendered "there" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sham) is placed emphatically, at the end of the sentence. Thus the Septuagint, "There is a reason for every action, and for every work there (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>)." Many take it to mean" in the other world," and Plumptre cites Eurip., 'Med.,' 1073 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"All good be with you! but it must be there;<br />Here it is stolen from you by your sire."</span> But it is unexampled to find the elliptical "there," when no place has been mentioned in the context, and when we are precluded from interpreting the dark word by a significant gesture, as Medea may have pointed downwards in her histrionic despair. Where the words, "that day," are used in the New Testament (e.g. <a href="../../par/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-18.htm">2 Timothy 1:18</a>, etc.), the context shows plainly to what they refer. Some take the adverb here in the sense of "then." Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justum et impium iudicabit Deus</span>, <span class="accented">et tempus omnis rei tunc erit</span>." But really no time has been mentioned, unless we conceive the writer to have been guilty of a clumsy tautology, expressing by "then" the same idea as "<span class="accented">a</span> time for every <span class="accented">purpose</span>," etc. Ewald would understand it of the past; but this is quite arbitrary, and limits the signification of the sentence unnecessarily. It is best, with many modern commentators, to refer the adverb to God, who has just been spoken of in the preceding clause. A similar use is found in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-24.htm">Genesis 49:24</a>. With God, <span class="accented">spud Deum</span>, in his counsels, there is a time or judgment and retribution for every act of man, when anomalies which have obtained on earth shall be rectified, injustice shall be punished, virtue rewarded. There is no need, with some commentators, to read up, "he appointed;" the usual reading gives a satisfactory sense.

So the Syriac. The word <span class="accented">dibrah</span> may indeed bear that meaning, as it is also used for "<span class="accented">word"</span> or "<span class="accented">matter</span>;" but we cannot conceive that the clause refers solely to words, and the expression in the text signifies merely "<span class="accented">for</span> the sake, on account of," as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That God might manifest them</span>; rather, <span class="accented">that God might test them</span>; <span class="accented">Ut probaret eos Dens</span> (Vulgate). God allows these things, endures them patiently, and does not at once redress them, for two reasons. The first of these is that they may serve for the probation of men, giving them opportunity of making good or bad use of them. We see the effect of this forbearance on the wicked in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; it hardens them in impenitence; while it nourishes the faith of the righteous, and helps them to persevere (see <a href="../../par/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</span> The pronoun is repeated emphatically, "that they themselves are [like] beasts, they in themselves." This is the second reason. Thus they learn their own powerlessness, if they regard merely their own animal life; apart from their relation to God and hope of the future, they are no better than the lower creatures. Septuagint. "And to show (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) that they are beasts." So the Vulgate and Syriac.

We must acknowledge that there are disorders in the world which we cannot remedy, and  which God allows in order to demonstrate our powerlessness; therefore the wisest course is to make the best of present cir-circumstances. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">chance are the sons of men</span>, <span class="accented">and chance are beasts</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 2:14); Septuagint, "<span class="accented">Yea</span>, and to them cometh the event (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men, and the event of the <span class="accented">beast</span>." Koheleth explains in what respect man is on a level with the brute creation. Neither are able to rise superior to the law that controls their natural life. So Solon <span class="accented">says</span> to Croesus (Herod., 1:32), <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;</span>, "Man is naught but chance;" and Artabanns reminds Xerxes that chances rule men, not men chances (ibid., 7:49). <span class="cmt_word">Even one thing befalleth them</span>. A third time is the ominous word repeated, "One chance is to both of them." Free-thinkers perverted this dictum into the materialistic language quoted in the Book of Wisdom (2. 2): "We are born at haphazard, by chance (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x1ffd;</span>); etc. But Koheleth's contention is, not that there is no law or order in what happens to man, but that neither man nor beast can dispose events at their own will and pleasure; they are conditioned by a force superior to them, which dominates their actions, sufferings, and circumstances of life. <span class="cmt_word">As the one dieth, so dieth the other</span>. In the matter of succumbing to the law of death man has no superiority over other creatures. This is an inference drawn from common observation of exterior facts, and touches not any higher question (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:2, 3</a>). Something similar is found in <a href="../../par/psalms/49-20.htm">Psalm 49:20</a>, "<span class="accented">Man</span> that is in honor, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish." <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they have all one breath</span> (<span class="accented">ruach</span>). This is the word used in ver. 23 for the vital principle, "the breath of life," as it is called in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a>, where the same word is found. In the earlier record (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) the term is <span class="accented">nishma</span>. Life in all animals is regarded as the gift of God. Says the psalmist, "Thou sendest forth thy spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>), they are created" (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>). This lower principle presents the same phenomena in men and in brutes. <span class="cmt_word">Man hath no pre-eminence above a beast</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in regard to suffering and death. This is not bare materialism, or a gloomy deduction from Greek teaching, but must be explained from the writer's standpoint, which is to emphasize the impotence of man to effect his own happiness. Taking only a limited and phenomenal view of man's circumstances and destiny, he speaks a general truth which all must acknowledge. Septuagint, "And what hath the man more than the beast? Nothing." <span class="cmt_word">For all is vanity</span>. The distinction between man and beast is annulled by death; the former's boasted superiority, his power of conceiving and planning, his greatness, skill, strength. cunning, all come under the category of vanity, as they cannot ward off the inevitable blow. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All go unto one place</span>. All, men and brutes, are buried in the earth (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). The author is not thinking of Sheol, the abode of departed spirits, but merely regarding earth as the universal tomb of all creatures. Plumptre quotes Lueretius, 'De Rer. <span class="accented">Nat</span>.,' 5:260 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Omniparens eadem rerum commune sepulchrum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The mother and the sepulcher of all."</span> Thus Bailey, 'Festus' - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The course of nature seems a course of death;<br />The prize of life's brief race, to cease to run;<br />The sole substantial thing, death's nothingness."</span> <span class="cmt_word">All are of the dust</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-29.htm">Psalm 104:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>). So Ecclus. 41:10, "All things that are of earth shall turn to earth again." This is true of the material part of men and brutes alike; the question of the destiny of the immaterial part is touched in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</span> The statement is here too categorically rendered, though, for dogmatical purposes, the Masorites seem to have punctuated the text with a view to such interpretation. But, as Wright and others point out, the analogy of two other passages (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:19</a> and Ecclesiastes 6:12), where "who knoweth" occurs, intimates that the phrases which follow are interrogative. So the translation should be, "Who knoweth as regards the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) of the sons of men whether it goeth upward, and as regards the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>) of the beast whether it goeth downward under the earth?" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quis novit si spiritus</span>, etc.? Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>; "Who ever saw the spirit of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of man, whether it goeth upward?" The Authorized Version, which gives the Masoretic reading, is supposed to harmonize better with the assertion at the end of the book (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>), that the spirit returns to the God who gave it. But there is no formal denial of the immortality of the soul in the present passage as we render it. The question, indeed, is not touched. The author is confirming his previous assertion that, in one point of view, man is not superior to brute. Now he says, looking at the matter merely externally, and taking not into consideration any higher notion, no one knows the destiny of the living powers, whether God deals differently with the spirit of man and of beast. Phenomenally, the principle of life in both is identical, and its cessation is identical; and what becomes of the spirit in either case neither eye nor mind can discover. The distinction which reason or religion assumes, viz. that man's spirit goes upward and the brute's downward, is incapable of proof, is quite beyond experience. What is meant by "upward" and "downward" may be seen by reference to the gnome in <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-24.htm">Proverbs 15:24</a>, "To the wise the way of life goeth upward, that he may depart from Sheol beneath." The contrast shows that Sheol is regarded as a place of punishment or annihilation; this is further confirmed by <a href="../../par/psalms/49-14.htm">Psalm 49:14, 15</a>, "They are appointed as a flock for Sheol: death shall be their shepherd...  their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; for he shall receive me." Koheleth neither denies nor affirms in this passage the immortality of the soul; that he believed in it we learn from other expressions; but he is not concerned with parading it here. Commentators quote Lucretius' sceptical thought ('De Rer. Nat.,' 1:113-116) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ignoratur enim quae sit natura animal,<br />Nata sit, an contra nascentibus insinuetur,<br />Et simul interest nobiscum, morte dimenta,<br />An tenebras Orci visat vastasque lacunas."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"We know not what the nature of the soul,<br />Born in the womb, or at the birth infused,<br />Whether it dies with us, or wings its way<br />Unto the gloomy pools of Orcus vast."</span> But Koheleth's inquiry suggests the possibility of a different destiny for the spirits of man and brute, though he does not at this moment make any definite assertion on the subject. Later on he explains the view taken by the believer in Divine revelation (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore I perceive that <i>there is</i> nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that <i>is</i> his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - After all, the writer arrives at the conclusion intimated in ver. 12; only here the result is gathered from the acknowledgment of man's impotence (vers. 16-18), as there from the experience of life. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better</span>, etc.; rather, <span class="accented">so</span>, or <span class="accented">wherefore I saw that there was nothing</span>, etc. As man is not master of his own lot, cannot order events as he would like, is powerless to control the forces of nature and the providential arrangements of the world, his duty and his happiness consist in enjoying the present, in making the best of life, and availing himself of the bounties which the mercy of God places before him. Thus he will free himself from anxieties and cares, perform present labors, attend to present duties, content himself with the daily round, and not vex his heart with solicitude for the future. There is no Epicureanism here, no recommendation of sensual enjoyment; the author simply advises men to make a thankful use of the blessings which God provides for them. <span class="cmt_word">For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</span> The Revised Version, by inserting "back" <span class="accented">- Who shall bring him back to</span> see? - affixes a meaning to the clause which it need not and does not bear. It is, indeed, commonly interpreted to signify that man knows and can know nothing that happens to him after death - whether he will exist or not, whether he will have cognizance of what passes on earth, or be insensible to all that befalls here. But Koheleth has completed that thought already; his argument now turns to the future in this life. Use the present, for you cannot be sure of the future; - this is his exhortation. So he says (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>), "Who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?" where the expression, "under the sun," shows that earthly life is meant, not existence after death. Ignorance of the future is a very common topic throughout the book, but it is the terrestrial prospect that is in view. There would be little force in urging the impotence of men's efforts towards their own happiness by the consideration of their ignorance of what may happen when they are no more; but one may reasonably exhort men to cease to torment themselves with hopes and fears, with labors that may be useless and preparations that may never be needed, by the reflection that they cannot foresee the future, and that, for all they know, the pains which they take may be utterly wasted (cf. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>). Thus in this section there is neither skepticism nor Epicureanism. In brief, the sentiment is this - There are injustices and anomalies in the life of men and in the course of this world's events which man cannot control or alter; these may be righted and compensated hereafter. Meantime, man's happiness is to make the best of the present, and cheerfully to enjoy what Providence offers, without anxious care for the future. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/4.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/3.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 3">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 4 <a href="../ecclesiastes/5.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of <i>such as were</i> oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors <i>there was</i> power; but they had no comforter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-16.</span> - Section 5.

There was no one to wipe away their tears (<a href="../../par/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>) or to redress their wrongs.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec posse resistere eorun violentiae</span>, <span class="accented">cunctorum auxilio destitutes</span>. <span class="accented">It</span> is difficult to suppose that the state of things revealed by this verse existed in the days of King Solomon, or that so powerful a monarch, and one admired for "judgment and justice" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>), would be content with complaining of such disorders instead of checking them. There is no token of remorse for past unprofitableness or anguish of heart at the thought of failure in duty. If we take the words as the utterance of the real Solomon, we do violence to history, and must correct the existing chronicles of his reign. The picture here presented is one of later times, and it may be of other countries. Persian rule, or the tyranny of the Ptolemies, might afford an original from which it might be taken.

In our own Burial Service we thank God for delivering the departed "out of the miseries of this sinful world." Keble alludes to this barbarian custom in his poem on' The Third Sunday after Easter.'

The Buddhist religion does not recommend suicide as an escape from the evils of life. It indeed regards man as master of his own life; but it considers suicide foolish, as it merely transfers a man's position, the thread of life having to be taken up again under less favorable circumstances. See 'A Buddhist Catechism,' by Subhadra Bhikshu (London: Redway, 1890). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span> He repeats the words, "under the sun," from ver. 1, in order to show that he is speaking of facts that came under his own regard - outward phenomena which any thoughtful observer might notice (so again ver. 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour.

The word rendered "right" is <span class="accented">kishron</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 2:21), and means rather "dexterity," "success." Kohe-leth says that he reflected upon the industry that men exhibit, and the skill and dexterity with which they ply their incessant toil. There is no reference to moral rectitude in the reflection, and the allusion to the ostracism of Aristides for being called "Just" overshoots the mark (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "all manliness of his work." <span class="cmt_word">That for this a man is envied of his neighbor.</span> <span class="accented">Kinah</span> may mean either "object of envy" or "envious rivalry;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the clause may be translated as above, or, as in the Revised Version margin, "it cometh of a man's rivalry with his neighbor." The Septuagint is ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "That this is a man's envy from his comrade;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Industrias animadverti patere invidiae proximi</span>, "Lay open to a neighbor's envy." In the first case the thought is that unusual skill and success expose a man to envy and ill will, which rob labor of all enjoyment. In the second case the writer says that this superiority and dexterity arise from a mean motive, an envious desire to outstrip a neighbor, and, based on such low ground, can lead to nothing but <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit</span>, a striving after wind. The former explanation seems more in accordance with Koheleth's gloomy view. Success itself is no guarantee of happiness; the malice and ill feeling which it invariably occasions are necessarily a source of pain and distress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The connection of this verse with the preceding is this: activity, diligence, and skill indeed bring success, but success is accompanied by sad results. Should we, then, sink into apathy, relinquish work, let things slide? Nay, none but the fool (<span class="accented">kesil</span>), the insensate, half-brutish man, doth this. <span class="cmt_word">The fool foldeth his hands together</span>. The attitude expresses laziness and disinclination for active labor, like that of the sluggard in <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And eateth his own flesh</span>. Ginsburg, Plumptre, and others take these words to mean "and yet eats his meat," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. gets that enjoyment from his sluggishness which is denied to active diligence. They refer, in proof of this interpretation, to <a href="../../par/exodus/16-8.htm">Exodus 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-17.htm">Ezekiel 39:17</a>, in which passages, however, the phrase is never equivalent to "eating his food." The expression is really equivalent to "destroys himself," "brings ruin upon himself." Thus we have in <a href="../../par/psalms/27-2.htm">Psalm 27:2</a>, "Evildoers came upon me to eat up my flesh;" and in <a href="../../par/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>, "Who eat the flesh of my people" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-26.htm">Isaiah 49:26</a>). The sluggard is guilty of moral suicide; he takes no trouble to provide for his necessities, and suffers extremities in consequence. Some see in this verse and the following an objection and its answer. There is no occasion for this view, and it is not in keeping with the context; but it contains an intimation of the true exposition, which makes ver. 6 a proverbial statement of the sluggard's position. The verbs in the text are participial in form, so that the Vulgate rendering, which supplies a verb, is quite admissible: <span class="accented">Stultus complicat manna suas</span>, <span class="accented">et comedit carnes suas</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>: <span class="accented">Melior est</span>, etc.

This verse, which has been variously interpreted, is most simply regarded as the fool's defense of his indolence, either expressed in his own words or fortified by a proverbial saying. One open hand full of quietness and rest is preferable to two closed hands full of toil and vain effort. The verse must not be taken as the writer's warning against sloth, which would be out of place here, but as enunciating a maxim against discontent and that restless activity which is never satisfied with moderate returns.

Here, he says, is another instance of man's inability to secure his own happiness. Wealth indeed, is supposed to make friends, such as they are; but miserliness and greed separate a man from his fellows, make him suspicious of every one, and drive him to live alone, churlish and unhappy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, he hath neither child nor brother</span>; no one to share his wealth, or for whom to save and amass riches. To apply these words to Solomon himself, who had brothers, and one son, if not more, is manifestly inappropriate. They may possibly refer to some circumstance in the writer's own life; but of that we know nothing. <span class="cmt_word">Yet is there no sad of all his labor</span>. In spite of this isolation he plies his weary task, and ceases not to hoard. <span class="cmt_word">Neither is his eye satisfied with riches</span>; so that he is content with what he has (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>). The insatiable thirst for gold, the dropsy of the mind, is a commonplace theme in classical writers. Thus Horace, 'Caxm.,' 3:16. 17 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Crescentem sequitur cura pecuniam, Majorumque fames."</span> And Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:138 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum turget sacculus ore,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecunia crevit."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Neither, saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good?</span> The original is more dramatic than the Authorized Version or the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nec recogitat</span>, <span class="accented">dicens</span>, <span class="accented">Cui laboro</span>, etc.? The writer suddenly puts himself in the place of the friendless miser, and exclaims, "And for whom do I labor," etc.? We see something similar in ver. 15 and <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:15</a>. Here we cannot find any definite allusion to the writer's own circumstances. The clause is merely a lively personification expressive of strong sympathy with the situation described (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18</a>). <span class="accented">Good</span> may mean either riches, in which case the denial to the soul refers to the enjoyment which wealth might afford, or happiness and comfort. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "goodness," "kindness " - which gives quite a different and not so suitable an idea. <span class="cmt_word">Sore travail</span>; a sad business, a woeful employment.

If one or the other fall, the companion will aid him. The idea is that two travelers are making their way over a rough road - an experience that every one must have had in Palestine. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si unus ceciderit</span>. Of course, if both fell at the same time, one could not help the other.

Hereby the advantage of association is more strongly enforced. If the companionship of two is profitable, much more is this the case when more combine. The cord of three strands was the strongest made. The number three is used as the symbol of completeness and perfection. <span class="accented">Funiculus triplex diffcile rumpitur</span>, the Vulgate rendering, has become a trite saying; and the gnome has been constantly applied in a mystical or spiritual sense, with which, originally and humanly speaking, it has no concern.

The words will bear this translation, and it accords with one view of the author's meaning (see below); but that given above is more suitable to the interpretation of the paragraph which approves itself to us. The sentence is of general import, and may be illustrated by a passage from the Book of Wisdom (4. 8, 9), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by length of years. But wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age." So Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 18:62, "Non cant nee rugae repente auctoritatem arripere possunt, sod honeste acta superior aetas fructus capit aactoritatis extremes." Some have thought that Solomon is here speaking of himself, avowing his folly and expressing his contrition, in view of his knowledge of Jeroboam's delegation to the kingdom - the crafty youth of poor estate (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26</a>, etc.), whom the Prophet Ahijah had warned of approaching greatness. But there is nothing in the recorded history of Solomon to make probable such expression of self-abasement, and our author could never have so completely misrepresented him. Here, too, is another proof that Ecclesiastes is not written by Solomon himself.

The Authorized Version makes the pronoun in the first clause refer to the youth, and those in the second to the king, with the signification that rich and poor change places - one is abased as the other is exalted. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quod de carcere catenisque interdum quis egrediatnr ad regnum</span>; <span class="accented">et alius natus in regno inopia consummatur</span>. The Septuagint is somewhat ambiguous, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "For from the house of prisoners he shall come forth to reign, because in his kingdom he [who?] was born [or, 'became'] poor." It seems, however, most natural to make the leading pronouns in both clauses refer to the youth, and thus to render: "For out of the house of prisoners goeth he forth to reign, though even in his kingdom he was born poor." <span class="accented">Beth hasurim</span> is also rendered "house of fugitives," and Hitzig takes the expression as a description of Egypt, whither Jeroboam fled to escape the vengeance of Solomon. Others see here an allusion to Joseph, who was raised from prison, if not to be king, at least to an exalted position which might thus be designated. In this case the old and foolish king who could not look to the future is Pharaoh, who could not understand the dream which was sent for his admonition. Commentators have wearied themselves with endeavoring to find some other historical basis for the supposed allusion in the passage. But although many of these suggestions (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Saul and David, Joash and Amaziah, Cyrus and Astyages, Herod and Alexander) meet a part of the case, none suit the whole passage (vers. 13-16). It is possible, indeed, that some particular allusion is intended to some circumstance or event with which we are not acquainted. At the same time, it seems to us that, without much straining of language, the reference to Joseph can be made good. If it is objected that it cannot be said that Joseph <span class="accented">was born</span> in the kingdom of Egypt, we may reply that the words may be taken to refer to his cruel position in his own country, when he was despoiled and sold, and may be said metaphorically to have "<span class="accented">become</span> poor;" or the word <span class="accented">nolad</span> may be considered as equivalent to "came," "appeared," and need not be restricted to the sense of "born."

The expression is hyperbolical, as Eastern monarchs speak of their dominions as if they comprised the whole world (see <a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-25.htm">Daniel 6:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</span> "With" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) means "in company with," "on the side of;" and the clause should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">That they were with the youth</span>, <span class="accented">the second</span>, <span class="accented">that stood up in his stead</span>. The youth who is called the second is the one spoken of in the previous verses, who by general acclamation is raised to the highest place in the realm, while the old monarch is dethroned or depreciated. He is named <span class="accented">second</span>, as being the successor of the other, either in popular favor or on the throne. It is the old story of worshipping the rising sun. The verse may still be applied to Joseph, who was made second to Pharaoh, and was virtually supreme in Egypt, standing in the king's place (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-40.htm">Genesis 41:40-44</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:16</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There is</i> no end of all the people, <i>even</i> of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.

The Authorized Version completely obscures this meaning. It is better to translate, <span class="accented">Numberless were the people</span>, <span class="accented">all</span>, <span class="accented">at whose head he stood</span>. Koheleth places himself in the position of a spectator, and marks how numerous are the adherents who flock around the youthful aspirant. "Nullus finis omni populo, omnibus, quibus praefuit" (Gesenius, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Volck). Yet his popularity was not lasting and his influence was not permanent. <span class="cmt_word">They also that come after shall not rejoice in him</span>. In spite of his cleverness, and notwithstanding the favor with which he is now regarded, those of a later generation shall flout his pretensions and forget his benefits. If we still continue the allusion to Joseph, we may see here in this last clause a reference to the change that supervened when another king arose who knew him not (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a>), and who, oblivious of the services of this great benefactor, heavily oppressed the Israelites. This experience leads to the same result; it is all <span class="cmt_word">vanity and vexation of spirit.</span>  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/5.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/4.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 4">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 5 <a href="../ecclesiastes/6.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-7.</span> - Section 6. Man's outward and secular life being unable to secure happiness and satisfaction, can these be found in <span class="accented">popular religion?</span> Religious exercises need the observation of strict rules, which are far from meeting with general attention. Koheleth proceeds to give instruction, in the form of maxims, concerning public worship, prayer, and vows. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - This verse, in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin Bibles, forms the conclusion of <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4.htm">Ecclesiastes 4</a>, and is taken independently; but the division in our version is more natural, and the connection of this with the following verses is obvious. <span class="cmt_word">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God</span>, Some read "feet" instead of "foot," but the singular and plural numbers are both found in this signification (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59, 105</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-15.htm">Proverbs 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26, 27</a>). To "keep the foot" is to be careful of the conduct, to remember what you are about, whither you are going. There is no allusion to the sacerdotal rite of washing the feet before entering the holy place (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 19</a>), nor to the custom of removing the shoes on entering a consecrated building, which was a symbol of reverential awe and obedient service. The expression is simply a term connected with man's ordinary life transferred to his moral and religious life. <span class="accented">The house of God</span> is the temple. The tabernacle is called "the house of Jehovah" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-20.htm">2 Samuel 12:20</a>), and this name is commonly applied to the temple; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-16.htm">2 Chronicles 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-11.htm">Ezra 3:11</a>. But "house of God" is applied also to the temple (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-14.htm">2 Chronicles 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8, 15</a>, etc.), so that we need not, with Bullock, suppose that Koheleth avoids the name of the Lord of the covenant as "a natural sign of the writer's humiliation after his fall into idolatry, and an acknowledgment of his unworthiness of the privileges of a son of the covenant." It is probable that the expression here is meant to include synagogues as well as the great temple at Jerusalem, since the following clause seems to imply that exhortation would be heard there, which formed no part of the temple service. The verse has furnished a text on the subject of the reverence due to God's house and service from Chrysostom downwards. <span class="cmt_word">And be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools.</span> Various are the renderings of this clause. Wright, "For to draw near to hear is (better) than the fools offering sacrifices." (So virtually Knobel, Ewald, etc.) Ginsburg, "For it is nearer to obey than to offer the sacrifice of the disobedient;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. it is the straighter, truer way to take when you obey God than when you merely perform outward service. The Vulgate takes the infinitive verb as equivalent to the imperative, as the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">Appropinqua ut audias</span>; but it is best to regard it as pure infinitive, and to translate, "To approach in order to hear is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools." The sentiment is the same as that in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, 'Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams." The same thought occurs in <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-3.htm">Proverbs 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7-15</a>; and continually in the prophets; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-21.htm">Jeremiah 7:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, etc. It is the reaction against the mere ceremonialism which marked the popular religion. Koheleth had seen and deplored this at Jerusalem and elsewhere, and he enunciates the great troth that it is more acceptable to God that one should go to his house to hear the Law read and taught and expounded, than to offer a formal sacrifice, which, as being the offering of a godless man is called in proverbial language "the sacrifice of fools" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>). The verb used here, "give" (nathan), is not the usual expression for offering sacrifice, and may possibly refer to the feast which accompanied such sacrifices, and which often degenerated into excess (Delitzsch). That the verb rendered "to hear" does not mean merely "to obey" is plain from its reference to conduct in the house of God. The reading of the Law, and probably of the prophets, formed a feature of the temple service in Koheleth's day; the expounding of the same in public was confined to the synagogues, which seem to have originated in the time of the exile, though there were doubtless before that time some regular occasions of assembling together (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For they consider not that they do evil</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Qui nesciunt quid faciunt mali</span> (Vulgate); "They are without knowledge, so that they do evil" (Delitzsch, Knobel, etc.); "As they (who obey) know not to do evil" (Gins-burg). The words can scarcely mean, "They know not that they do evil;" nor, as Hitzig has, "<span class="accented">They</span> know not how to be sorrowful." There is much difficulty in understanding the passage according to the received reading, and Nowack, with others, deems the text corrupt. If we accept what we now find, it is best to translate, "They know not, so that they do evil;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. their ignorance predisposes them to err in this matter. The persons meant are the "fools" who offer unacceptable sacrifices. These know not how to worship God heartily and properly, and, thinking to please him with their formal acts of devotion, fall into a grievous sin.

Thus our Lord bids those who pray not to use vain repetitions (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), as the heathen, who think to be heard for their much speaking (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-7.htm">Matthew 6:7</a>). Jesus himself used the same words in his prayer in the garden, and he continually urges the lesson of much and constant prayer - a lessen enforced by apostolic admonitions (see <a href="../../par/luke/11-5.htm">Luke 11:5</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:17</a>); but it is quite possible to use the same words, and yet throw the whole heart into them each time that they are repeated. Whether the repetition is vain or not depends upon the spirit of the person who prays. <span class="cmt_word">Let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God.</span> We should weigh well our wishes, arrange them discreetly, ponder whether they are such as we can rightly make subjects of petition, ere we lay them in words before the Lord. "Before God" may mean in the temple, the house of God, where he is specially present, as Solomon himself testified (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27, 30, 43</a>). <span class="cmt_word">God is in heaven</span>. The infinite distance between God and man, illustrated by the contrast of earth and the illimitable heaven, is the ground of the admonition to reverence and thoughtfulness (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4.htm">Isaiah 4</a>:8, 9; 66:1). Therefore let thy words be few, as becomes one who speaks in the awful presence of God. Ben-Sirs seems to have had this passage in mind when he writes (Ecclus. 7:14), "Prate not in a multitude of elders, and repeat not (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) the word in prayer." We may remember the conduct of the priests of Baal (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>). Ginsburg and Wright quote the Talmudic precept ('Beraehoth,' 68. a), "Let the words of a man always be few in the presence of God, according as it is written," and then follows the passage in our text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice <i>is known</i> by multitude of words.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The first clause illustrates the second, the mark of comparison being simply the copula, mere juxtaposition being deemed sufficient to denote the similitude, as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For a dream cometh through</span> (<span class="accented">in consequence of</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the multitude of business.</span> The verse is meant to confirm the injunction against vain babbling in prayer. Cares and anxieties in business or other matters occasion disturbed sleep, murder the dreamless repose of the healthy laborer, and produce all kinds of sick fancies and imaginations. Septuagint, "A dream cometh in abundance of trial (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Multas curas sequuntur somnia</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And a fool's voice is known by multitude of words</span>. The verb should be supplied from the first clause, and not a new one introduced, as in the Authorized Version, "And the voice of a fool (cometh) in consequence of many words." As surely as excess of business produces fevered dreams, so excess of words, especially in addresses to God, produces a fool's voice, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. foolish speech. St. Gregory points out the many ways in which the mind is affected by images from dreams. "Sometimes," he says, "dreams are engendered of fullness or emptiness of the belly, sometimes of illusion, sometimes of illusion and thought combined, sometimes of revelation, while sometimes they are engendered of imagination, thought, and revelation together" ('Moral.,' 8:42). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for <i>he hath</i> no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - Koheleth passes on to give a warning concerning the making of vows, which formed a great feature in Hebrew religion, and was the occasion of much irreverence and profanity. <span class="cmt_word">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it</span>. There is here plainly a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21-23</a>. Vows are not regarded as absolute duties which every one was obliged to undertake. They are of a voluntary nature, but when made are to be strictly performed. They might consist of a promise to dedicate certain things or persons to God (see <a href="../../par/genesis/38-20.htm">Genesis 38:20</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>), or to abstain from doing certain things, as in the case of the Nazarites. The rabbinical injunction quoted by our Lord in the sermon on the mount (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33</a>), "Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths," was probably levelled against profane swearing, or invoking God's Name lightly, but it may include the duty of performing vows made to or in the Name of God. Our Lord does not condemn the practice of <span class="accented">corban</span>, while noticing with rebuke a perversion of the custom (<a href="../../par/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>). For he hath no pleasure in fools. The non-fulfillment of a vow would prove a man to be impious, in proverbial language "a fool," and as such God must regard him with displeasure. The clause in the Hebrew is somewhat ambiguous, being literally, <span class="accented">There is no pleasure</span> (<span class="accented">chephets</span>) <span class="accented">in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no one, neither God nor man, would take pleasure in fools who make promises and never perform them. Or it may be, There <span class="accented">is no fixed will in fools</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they waver and are undecided in purpose. But this rendering of <span class="accented">chephets</span> appears to be very doubtful. Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> which reproduces the vagueness of the Hebrew; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Displicet enim ei</span> (<span class="accented">Deo</span>) <span class="accented">infidelis et stulta promissio</span>. The meaning is well represented in the Authorized Version, and we must complete the sense by supplying in thought "on the part of God." <span class="cmt_word">Pay that which thou but vowed</span>. Ben-Sirs re-echoes the injunction (Ecclus. 18:22, 23), "Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) in due time, and defer not until death to be justified [i.e. to fulfill the vow]. Before making a vow (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) prepare thyself; and be not as one that tempteth the Lord." The verse is cited in the Talmud; and Dukes gives a parallel, "Before thou vowest anything, consider the object of thy vow" ('Rabb. Blumenl.,' p. 70). So in <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-25.htm">Proverbs 20:25</a> we have, according to some translations, "It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy, and after vows to make inquiry." Septuagint," Pay thou therefore whatsoever thou shalt have vowed (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3be;&#x3b7;</span>),

There is no harm in not vowing (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-22.htm">Deuteronomy 23:22</a>); but a vow once made becomes of the nature of an oath, and its non-performance is a sin and sacrilege, and incurs the punishment of false swearing. We gather from the Talmud that frivolous excuses for the evasion of vows were very common, and called for stern repression, One sees this in our Lord's references (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-22</a>). St. Paul severely reprehends those women who break their vow of widowhood, "having condemnation, because they have rejected their first faith" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-12.htm">1 Timothy 5:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it <i>was</i> an error: wherefore should God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin</span>. "Thy flesh" is equivalent to "thyself," the whole personality, the idea of the flesh, as a distinct part of the man, sinning, being alien from Old Testament ontology. The injunction means - Do not, by uttering rash or inconsiderate vows, which you afterwards evade or cannot fulfill, bring sin upon yourself, or, as others render, bring punishment upon yourself. Septuagint, "Suffer not thy mouth to Cause thy flesh to sin(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut peccare facias carnem tuam</span>. Another interpretation, but not so suitable, is this - Do not let thy mouth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy appetite) lead thee to break the vow of abstinence, and indulge in meat or drink from which (as, <span class="accented">e.g</span>., a Nazarite) thou wast bound to abstain. <span class="cmt_word">Neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error</span>. If we take "angel" (<span class="accented">malak</span>) in the usual sense (and there seems no very forcible reason why we should not), it must mean the angel of God in whose special charge you are placed, or the angel who was supposed to preside over the altar of worship, or that messenger of God whose duty it is to watch man's doings and to act as the minister of punishment (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>). The workings of God's providence are often attributed to angels; and sometimes the names of God and angel are interchanged (see <a href="../../par/genesis/16-9.htm">Genesis 16:9, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2, 3</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc.). Thus the Septuagint here renders, "Say not before the face of God (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="accented">  =  </span><span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)." If this interpretation be allowed, we have an argument for the literal explanation of the much-disputed passage in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus, too, in 'The Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs,' we have, "The Lord is witness, and his angels are witnesses, concerning the word of your mouth" ('Levi,' 19). But most commentators consider that the word here means "messenger" of Jehovah, in the sense of priest, the announcer of the Divine Law, as in the unique passage <a href="../../par/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>. Traces of a similar use of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be found in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1</a>, etc.). According to the first interpretation, the man comes before God with his excuse; according to the second, he comes to the priest, and confesses that he was thoughtless and overhasty in making his vow, and desires to be released from it, or, at any rate, by some means to evade its fulfillment. His excuse may possibly look to the cases mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/15-22.htm">Numbers 15:22</a>, etc., and he may wish to urge that the vow was made in ignorance (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "It is an ignorance"), and that therefore he was not responsible for its incomplete execution. We do not know that a priest or any officer of the temple had authority to release from the obligation of a <span class="accented">Tow</span>, <span class="accented">so</span> that the excuse made "before" him would seem to be objectless, while the evasion of a solemn promise made in the Name of God might well be said to be done in the presence of the observing and recording angel. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">Non eat providentia</span>, makes the man account for his neglect by assuming that God takes no heed of such things; he deems the long-suffering of God to be indifference and disregard (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>). The original does not bear this interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore should God be angry at thy voice</span> - the words in which thy evasion and dishonesty are expressed - <span class="cmt_word">and destroy the work of thine hands?</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. punish thee by calamity, want of success, sickness, etc., God's moral government being vindicated by earthly visitations.

Koheleth sums up the sense of the preceding paragraph, vers. 1-6. The popular religion, which made much of dreams and verbosity and vows, is vanity, and has in it nothing substantial or comforting. The superstitious man who puts his faith in dreams is unpractical and unreal; the garrulous man who is rash in his vows, and in prayer thinks to be heard for his much speaking, displeases God and never secures his object. Ginsburg and Bullock render, "For it is (it happens) through the multitude of idle thoughts and vanities and much talking," the reference being either to the foolish speaking of ver. 2 or to the wrath of God in ver. 6. The Septuagint rendering is elliptical, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ubi multa aunt somnia</span>, <span class="accented">plurimae aunt vanitates</span>, <span class="accented">et sermones innumeri</span>.' The Authorized Version gives the sense of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">But fear thou God.</span> In contrast with these spurious forms of religion, which the Jews were inclined to adopt, the writer recalls men to the fear of the one true God, to whom all vows should be performed, and who should be worshipped from the heart.

Be not surprised or dismayed (<a href="../../par/job/26-11.htm">Job 26:11</a>) at such evil doings,, as though they were unheard of, or inexperienced, or disregarded. There is here nothing of the Greek maxim, reproduced by Horace in his "Nil admirari" ('Epist.,' 1:6. 1). It is like St. John's "Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-13.htm">1 John 3:13</a>); or St. Peter's "Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial among' you" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>). The stupid and unintelligent observation of such disorders might lead to arraignment of Providence and distrust in the moral government of God. Against such mistakes the writer guards. <span class="cmt_word">For he that is higher than the highest regardeth.</span> Both the words are in the singular number. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. One thinks of the Persian satraps, who acted much as the Turkish pashas in later times, the petty rulers oppressing the people, and being themselves treated in the same fashion by their superiors. The whole is a system of wrong-doing, where the weaker always suffers, and the only comfort is that the oppressor himself is subject to higher supervision. The verb (<span class="accented">shamar</span>) translated "regardeth" means to observe in a hostile sense, to watch for occasions of reprisal, as <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11</a>; and the idea intended is that in the province there were endless plottings and counterplottings, mutual denunciations and recriminations; that such things were only to be expected, and were no sufficient cause for infidelity or despair. "The higher one" is the monarch, the despotic king who holds the supreme power over all these malad-ministrators and perverters of justice. <span class="cmt_word">And there be higher than they</span>. "Higher" is here plural (<span class="accented">gebohgm</span>), the plural of majesty, as it is called (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:1</a>), like <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, the word for "God," the assonance being probably here suggestive. Over the highest of earthly rulers there are other powers, angels, principalities, up to God himself, who governs the course of this world, and to whom we may leave the final adjustment. Who are meant seems purposely to be left undetermined; but the thought of the righteous Judge of all is intimated in accordance with the view of <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:17</a>. This is a far more satisfactory explanation of the passage than that which regards as the highest of all "the court favorites, king's friends, eunuchs, chamberlains," etc. In this view Koheleth is merely asserting the general system of injustice and oppression, and neither accounting for it nor offering any comfort under the circumstances. But his object throughout is to show man's inability to secure his own happiness, and the need of submission to Divine providence. To demonstrate the anomalies in the events of the world, the circumstances of men's lives would be only one part of his task, which would not be completed without turning attention to the remedy against hasty and unfair conclusions. This remedy is the thought of the supreme Disposer of events, who holds all the strings in his hand, and will in the end bring good out of evil. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king <i>himself</i> is served by the field.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - It has been much debated whether this verse should be connected with the preceding or the following paragraph. The Vulgate takes it with the preceding verse, <span class="accented">Et insuper universae terrae rex imperat servienti</span>; so the Septuagint; and this seems most natural, avarice, wealth, and its evils in private life being treated of in vers. 10 and many following. <span class="cmt_word">Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field.</span> The writer seems to be contrasting the misery of Oriental despotism, above spoken of, with the happiness of a country whose king was content to enrich himself, not by war, rapine, and oppression, but by the peaceful pursuits of agriculture, by cherishing the natural productions of his country, and encouraging his people in developing its resources. Such was Uzziah, who" loved husbandry" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-10.htm">2 Chronicles 26:10</a>); and in Solomon's own time the arts of peace greatly flourished. There is much difficulty in interpreting the verse. The Vulgate rendering, "And moreover the King of the whole earth rules over his servant," probably means that God governs the king. But the present Hebrew text does not support this translation. The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which makes more difficulties. "Also the abundance of the earth is for every one, or upon every thing; the king (is dependent on) the cultivated land, or, there is a king to the land when cultivated," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the throne itself depends on the due cultivation of the country. Or, removing the comma, "The profit of the land in everything is a king of the cultivated field." The Hebrew may safely be rendered, "But the profit of a land in all things is a king devoted to the field," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. who loves and fosters agriculture. It is difficult to suppose that Solomon himself wrote this sentence, however we may interpret it. According to the Authorized Version, the idea is that the profit of the soil extends to every rank of life; even the king, who seems superior to all, is dependent upon the industry of the people, and the favorable produce of the land. He could not be unjust and oppressive without injuring his revenues in the end. Ben-Sirs sings the praises of agriculture: "Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry., which the Most High hath ordained" (Ecclus. 7:15). Agriculture held a very prominent position in the Mosaic commonwealth. The enactments concerning the firstfruits, the sabbatical year, landmarks, the non-alienation of inheritances, etc., tended to give peculiar importance to cultivation of the soil. Cicero's praise of agriculture is often quoted. Thus ('De Senect.,' 15. <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 'De Off.,' 1:42):" Omninm return, ex quibus aliquid acquiritur, nihil est agricultura melius, nihil uberius, nihil dulcius, nihil heroine libero dignius." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a></div><div class="verse">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this <i>is</i> also vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-17.</span> - The thought of the acts of injustice and oppression noticed above, all of which spring from the craving for money, leads the bard to dwell upon the evils that accompany this pursuit and possession of wealth, which is thus seen to give no real satisfaction. Avarice has already been noticed (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:7-12</a>); the covetous man now reprobated is one who desires wealth only for the enjoyment he can get from it, or the display which it enables him to make, not, like the miser, who gloats over its mere possession. Various instances are given in which riches are unprofitable and vain. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver</span>. "Silver," the generic name for money, as Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and French <span class="accented">argent</span>. The insatiableness of the passion for money is a common theme of poets, moralists, and satirists, and is found in the proverbs of all nations. Thus Horace ('Ep.,' 1:2. 56): "Semper avarus eget;" to which St Jerome alludes ('Epist.,' 53), "Antiquum dictum est, Avaro tam deest, quod habet, quam quod non habet." Comp. Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:139 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Interea pleno quum forget sacculus ere,<br />Crescit amor nummi, quantum ipsa pecnnia crevit."</span><br /><span class="accented">"For as thy strutting bags with money rise,<br />The love of gain is of an equal size."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Dryden.</span>) There is much more of similar import in Horace. See 'Carm.,' 2:2. 13, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; 3:16. 17, 28; 'Ep.,' 2:2, 147; an, 1 Ovid, Fast.,' 1:211 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Creverunt etopes et opum furiosa cupido,<br />Et, quum possideant plura, plura volunt."</span><br /><span class="accented">"As wealth increases grows the frenzied thirst<br />For wealth; the more they have, the more they want."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor he that loveth abundance with increase</span>. The Authorized Version scarcely presents the sense of the passage, which is not tautological, but rather that given by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et qui amat divitias fructum non capiet exeis</span>, "He who loveth abundance of wealth hath no fruit therefrom;" he derives no real profit or enjoyment from the luxury which it enables him to procure; rather it brings added trouble. And so the old conclusion is again reached, this is also vanity. Hitzig takes the sentence as interrogative, "Who hath pleasure in abundance which brings nothing in?" But such questions are hardly in the style of Kohelcth, and the notion of capital without interest is not a thought which would have been then understood. The Septuagint, however, reads the clause interrogatively, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">al</span>.) <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; "And who has loved [or, has been content with] gain in its fullness?" But <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is not necessarily interrogative, but here indefinite, equivalent to "whosoever." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good <i>is there</i> to the owners thereof, saving the beholding <i>of them</i> with their eyes?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Koheleth proceeds to notice some of the inconveniences which accompany wealth, which go far to prove that God is over all. <span class="cmt_word">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them.</span> The more riches a man possesses, the greater are the claims upon him. He increases his household, retainers, and dependents, and is really none the better off for all his wealth. So Job in his prosperous days is said to have had "a very great household" (<a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), and the servants and laborers employed by Solomon must have taxed to the utmost even his abnormal resources (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>, etc.). Commentators from Piueda downwards have quoted the remarkable parallel in Xenoph., 'Cyropaed.,' 8:3, wherein the wealthy Persian Pheraulas, who had risen from poverty to high estate, disabuses a young Sacian friend of the idea that his riches made him happier or afforded supreme content. "Do you not know," said he," that I neither eat, nor drink, nor sleep with any more pleasure now than I did when I was poor? by having this abundance I gain merely this, that I have to guard more, to distribute more among others, and to have the trouble of taking care of more. For now numerous domestics demand of me food, drink, clothes; some want the doctor; one comes and brings me sheep that have been torn by wolves, or oxen killed by failing down a precipice, or tells of a murrain that has affected the cattle; so that I seem to myself to have more afflictions in my abundance than I had when I was poor,...  It is obligatory on him who possesses much to expend much both on the gods and on friends and on strangers; and whosoever is greatly pleased with the possession of riches will, you may be assured, be greatly annoyed at the expenditure of them." <span class="cmt_word">What good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?</span> What it is that the owners behold is doubtful. Ginsburg considers that the increased number of devourers is meant; but surely this sight could hardly be called <span class="accented">kishron</span>, "success, profit." So it is better to take the sight to be the amassed wealth. The contemplation of this is the only enjoyment that the possessor realizes. So the Vulgate, Et <span class="accented">quid prodest possessori</span>, <span class="accented">nisi quod cernit divitias oculis suis?</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>," And in what does the excellence of the owner consist? except the power of seeing it with his eyes."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:12</a></div><div class="verse">The sleep of a labouring man <i>is</i> sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Another inconvenience of great wealth - it robs a man of his sleep. <span class="cmt_word">The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much.</span> The laborer is the husbandman, the tiller of the ground (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-2.htm">Genesis 4:2</a>). The Septuagint, with a different pointing, renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "slave," which is less appropriate, the fact being generally true of free or bond man. Whether his fare be plentiful or scanty, the honest laborer earns and enjoys his night's rest. <span class="cmt_word">But the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.</span> The allusion is not to the overloading of the stomach, which might occasion sleeplessness in the case of the poor equally with the rich man, but to the cares and anxieties which wealth brings. "Not a soft couch, nor a bedstead overlaid with silver, nor the quietness that exists throughout the house, nor any other circumstance of this nature, are so generally wont to make sleep sweet and pleasant, as that of laboring, and growing weary, and lying down with a disposition to sleep, and very greatly needing it .... Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst lying on their beds, they are frequently without sleep through the whole night; and, though they devise many schemes, they do not obtain such pleasure" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. on Stat.,' 22). The contrast between the grateful sleep of the tired worker and the disturbed rest of the avaricious and moneyed and luxurious has formed a fruitful theme for poets. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 3:1.21 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Somnus agrestium<br />Lenis virorum non humiles domes<br />Fastidit umbrosamque ripam,<br />Non Zephyris agitata Tempe."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Yet sleep turns never from the lowly shed<br />Of humbler-minded men, nor from the eaves<br />In Tempe's graceful vale is banished,<br />Where only Zephyrs stir the murmuring leaves."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Stanley.</span>) And the reverse, 'Sat.,' 1:1.76, <span class="accented">sqq</span>. <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"An vigilare metu exanimem, noctesque diesque<br />Formidare males fures, inccndia, serves,<br />Ne to compilent fugientes, hoc juvat?"</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"But what are your indulgencies?

There is no need to confine the cause of the loss to unsuccessful business, as many commentators do. The rich man does not seem to be a tradesman or speculator; he loses his property, like Job, by visitations for which he is in no way answerable - by storm or tempest, by robbers, by fire, by exactions, or by lawsuits. <span class="cmt_word">And he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.</span> The verb rendered "begetteth" is in the past tense, and used as it were, hypothetically, equivalent to "hath he begotten a son," supposing he has a son. His misery is doubled by the reflection that he has lost all hope of securing a fortune for his children, or founding a family, or passing on an inheritance to posterity. It is doubtful to whom the pronoun "his" refers. Many consider that the father is meant, and the clause says that when he has begotten a son, he finds he has nothing to give him. But the suffix seems most naturally to refer to the son, who is thus left a pauper. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Generavit filium qui in summa egestate erit</span>. Having a thing in the hand moans having power over it, or possessing it.

What is true of him is, in a measure, true of every one, so far as he can carry nothing away with him when he dies (<a href="../../par/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came.</span> There is a plain reference to <a href="../../par/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither." The <span class="accented">mother</span> is the earth, human beings being regarded as her offspring. So the psalmist says, "My frame was curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/139-15.htm">Psalm 139:15</a>). And Ben-Sira, "Great trouble is created for every man, and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb till the day that they return to the mother of all things." <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-7.htm">1 Timothy 6:7</a>, "We brought nothing into the world, neither can we carry anything out."

To labor for the wind is to toil with no result, like the "feeding on wind, pursuing of vanity," which is the key-note of the book. The wind is the type of all that is empty, delusive, unsubstantial. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a> we have the phrase, "to inherit the wind." Job calls futile arguments "words of wind" (<a href="../../par/job/16-3.htm">Job 16:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-2.htm">Job 15:2</a>).

But the other versions reject this alteration, and few modern commentators adopt it. <span class="cmt_word">And he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and much vexation</span>, <span class="accented">and sickness</span>, <span class="accented">and wrath</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">he is sore vexed</span>, <span class="accented">and hath sickness and wrath</span>. Delitzsch takes the last words as an exclamation, "And oh for his sorrow and hatred!" The man experiences all kinds of vexation when his plans fail or involve him in trouble and privation; or he is morbid and diseased in mind and body; or he is angry and envious when others succeed better than himself. The sentiment is expressed by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) in destruction and perdition." "For," he proceeds, "the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, which some reaching after have been led astray from the faith, and have pierced themselves through (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) with many sorrows." The Septuagint continues its version, "And in much passion (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) and in infirmity and wrath." The anger may be directed against himself, as he thinks of his folly in taking all this trouble for nothing.

Before he can enjoy his possessions a man must first receive them from God's hands. The two terms here used are not quite synonymous.

The marginal rendering, "<span class="accented">Though</span> he give <span class="accented">not much</span>, yet <span class="accented">he remembereth</span>," etc., which Ginsburg calls a literary curiosity, must have been derived from the version of Junius, which gives, "Quod si non multum (<span class="accented">supple</span>, est illud quod dederit Deus, <span class="accented">ex versu praec</span>.)," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Because God answereth him in the joy of his heart</span>.

But this modified Epicureanism is alien from the teaching of Koheleth. Rather the idea is that God answers him with, imparts to him, joy of heart, makes him sensible of his favorable regard by this inward feeling of satisfaction and content. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/6.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/5.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 5">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 6 <a href="../ecclesiastes/7.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it <i>is</i> common among men:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-6.</span> - Section 9.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this <i>is</i> vanity, and it <i>is</i> an evil disease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honor.</span> This is the evil to which reference is made. Two of the words here given, "riches" and "honor," are those used by God in blessing Solomon in the vision at Gibeon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-13.htm">1 Kings 3:13</a>); but all three are employed in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth.</span> "His soul" is the man himself, his personality, as <a href="../../par/psalms/49-19.htm">Psalm 49:19</a>. So in the parable (<a href="../../par/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>) the rich fool says to his soul, "Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years." In the supposed case the man is able to procure for himself everything which he wants; has no occasion to deny himself the gratification of any rising desire. All this comes from God's bounty; but something more is wanted to bring happiness. <span class="cmt_word">Yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof.</span> "To eat" is used in a metaphorical sense for "to enjoy," take advantage of, make due use of (see on Ecclesiastes 2:24). The ability to enjoy all these good things is wanting, either from discontent, or moroseness, or sickness, or as a punishment for secret sin. <span class="cmt_word">But a stranger eateth it</span>. The "stranger" is not the legal heir, but an alien to the possessor's blood, neither relation nor even necessarily a friend. For a childless Oriental to adopt an heir is a common custom at the present day. The wish to continue a family, to leave a name and inheritance to children's children, was very strong among the Hebrews - all the stronger as the life beyond the grave was dimly apprehended. Abraham expressed this feeling when he sadly cried, "I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Dammesek Eliezer" (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>). The evils are two - that this great fortune brings no happiness to its possessor, and that it passes to one who is nothing to him. <span class="cmt_word">An evil disease</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, Septuagint, an evil as bad as the diseases spoken of in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27, 28</a>.

"Sons,' or "children," must be supplied (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-5.htm">1 Samuel 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>). To have a large family was regarded as a great blessing. The "hundred" is a round number, though we read of some fathers who had nearly this number of children; thus Ahab had seventy sons (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1</a>), Rehoboam eighty-eight children (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>). Plumptre follows some commentators in seeing here an allusion to Artaxerxes Mnemon, who is said to have had a hundred and fifteen children, and died of grief at the age of ninety-four at the suicide of one son and the murder of another. Wordsworth opines that Solomon, in the previous verse, was thinking of Jeroboam, who, it was revealed unto him, should, stranger as he was, seize and enjoy his inheritance. But these historical references are the merest guesswork, and rest upon no substantial basis. Plainly the author's statement is general, and there is no need to ransack history to find its parallel. <span class="cmt_word">And live many years, so that the days of his years be many</span>; <span class="accented">Et vixerit multos annos</span>, <span class="accented">et plures dies aetatis habuerit</span> (Vulgate). These versions seem to be simply tautological. The second clause is climacteric, as Ginsburg renders, "Yea, numerous as may be the days of his years." The whole extent of years is summed up in days. So <a href="../../par/psalms/90-10.htm">Psalm 90:10</a>, "The days of our years are three score years and ten," etc. Long life, again, was deemed a special blessing, as we see in the commandment with promise (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">yet if</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his soul not filled with good</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he does not satisfy himself with the enjoyment of all the good things which he possesses. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> "And his soul shall not be satisfied with his good." <span class="cmt_word">And also that he have no burial.</span> This is the climax of the evil that befalls him. Some critics, not entering into Koheleth's view of the severity of this calamity, translate, "and even if the grave did not wait for him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. "if he were never to die," if he were immortal. But there is no parallel to show that the clause can have this meaning; and we know, without having recourse to Greek precedents, that the want of burial was reckoned a grievous loss and dishonor. Hence comes the common allusion to dead carcasses being left to be devoured by beasts and birds, instead of meeting with honorable burial in the ancestral graves (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-22.htm">1 Kings 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-18.htm">Isaiah 14:18-20</a>). Thus David says to his giant foe, "I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>); and about Jehoiakim it was denounced that he should not be lamented when he died: "He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18, 19</a>). The lot of the rich man in question is proclaimed with ever-increasing misery. Ha cannot enjoy his possessions; he has none to whom to leave them; his memory perishes; he has no honored burial. <span class="cmt_word">I say, that an untimely birth is better than he</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>). The abortion or still-born child is preferable to one whose destiny is so miserable (see <a href="../../par/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/58-8.htm">Psalm 58:8</a>). It is preferable because, although it has missed all the pleasures of life, it has at least escaped all suffering. The next two verses illustrate this position. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:4</a></div><div class="verse">For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he cometh in with vanity</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for it came into nothingness</span>. The reference is to the fetus, or still-born child, not to the rich man, as is implied by the Authorized Version. This, when it appeared, had no independent life or being, was a mere nothing. <span class="cmt_word">And departeth in darkness</span>; and <span class="accented">goeth into the darkness</span>. It is taken away and put out of sight. <span class="cmt_word">And his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">name shall be covered with darkness.</span> It is a nameless thing, unrecorded, unremembered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known <i>any thing</i>: this hath more rest than the other.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - It has seen nothing of the world, known nothing of life, its joys and its sufferings, and is speedily forgotten. To" see the sun" is a metaphor for to "live," as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-16.htm">Job 3:16</a>, and implies activity and work, the contrary of rest. <span class="cmt_word">This hath more rest than the other</span>; literally, <span class="accented">there is rest to this more than to that</span>. The rest that belongs to the abortion is better than that which belongs to the rich man. Others take the clause to say simply, "It is better with this than the other." So the Revised Version margin and Delitzsch, the idea of "rest" being thus generalized, and taken to sights a preferable choice. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "And hath not known rest for this more than that " - which reproduces the difficulty of the Hebrew; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque cognovit distantiam boni et malt</span>, which is a paraphrase unsupported by the present accentuation of the text. Rest, in the conception of an Oriental, is the most desirable or' all things; compared with the busy, careworn life of the rich man, whose very moments of leisure and sleep are troubled and disturbed, the dreamless nothingness of the still-born child is happiness. This may be a rhetorical exaggeration, but we have its parallel in Job's lamentable cry in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. when he "cursed his day." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, though he live a thousand years twice <i>told</i>, yet hath he seen no good: do not all go to one place?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good</span>. What has been said would still be true even if the man lived two thousand years. The second clause is not the apodosis (as the Authorized Version makes it), but the continuation of the protasis: if he lived the longest life, "and saw not good;" the conclusion is given in the form of a question. The "good" is the enjoyment of life spoken of in ver. 3 (see on Ecclesiastes 2:1). The specified time seems to refer to the age of the patriarchs, none of whom, from Adam to Noah, reached half the limit assigned. <span class="cmt_word">Do not all go to one place</span>? viz. to Sheol, the grave (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:20</a>). If a long life were spent in calm enjoyment, it might be preferable to a short one; but when it is passed amid care and annoyance and discontent, it is no better than that which begins and ends in nothingness. The grave receives both, and there is nothing to choose between them, at least in this point of view. Of life as in itself a blessing, a discipline, a school, Koheleth says nothing here; he puts himself in the place of the discontented rich man, and appraises life with his eyes. On the common destiny that awaits peer and peasant, rich and poor, happy and sorrow-laden, we can all remember utterances old and new. Thus Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 20 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Divesne prisco natus ab Inacho,<br />Nil interest, an pauper et infima<br />De gente sub dive moreris,<br />Victima nil miserantis Orci.<br />"Omnes eodem cogimur."</span> Ovid, 'Met.,' 10:33 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Omnia debentur vobis, paullumque morati<br />Serius aut citius sedem properamus ad unam.<br />Tendimus huc omnes, haec est domus ultima."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Fate is the lord of all things; soon or late<br />To one abode we speed, thither we all<br />Pursue our way, this is our final home."</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:7</a></div><div class="verse">All the labour of man <i>is</i> for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - Section 10. <span class="accented">Desire is insatiable</span>; men are always striving after enjoyment, but they never gain their wish completely - which fortifies the old conclusion that man's happiness is not in his own power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the labor of man is for his mouth</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. for self-preservation and enjoyment, eating and drinking being taken as a type of the proper use of earthly blessings (comp; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>). The sentiment is general, and does not refer specially to the particular person described above, though it carries on the idea of the unsatisfactory result of wealth. Luther translates strangely and erroneously, "To every man is work allotted according to his measure. Such an idea is entirely foreign to the context. <span class="cmt_word">And yet the appetite is not filled</span>. The word rendered "appetite" is <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, "soul," and Zockler contends that "' mouth 'and 'soul' stand in contrast to each other as representatives of the purely sensual and therefore transitory enjoyment (comp. <a href="../../par/job/12-11.htm">Job 12:11</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>) as compared with the deeper, more spiritual, and therefore more lasting kind of joy." But no such contrast is intended; the writer would never have uttered such a truism as that deep, spiritual joy is not to be obtained by sensual pleasure; and, as Delitzsch points out, in some passages (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-26.htm">Proverbs 16:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-8.htm">Isaiah 29:8</a>) "mouth" in one sentence corresponds to "soul" in another. The soul is considered as the seat of the appetitive faculty - emotions, desires, etc. This is never satisfied (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>) with what it has, but is always craving for more. So Horace affirms that a man rightly obtains the appellation of king, "avidum domando spiritum," by subduing his spirit's cravings ('Carm.,' 2:2. 9).

The interpretation of the clause has much exercised critics. Plumptre adheres to that of Bernstein and others, "What advantage hath the poor over him who knows how to walk before the living?' (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the man of high birth or station, who lives in public, with the eyes of men upon him). The poor has his cares and unsatisfied desires as much as the man of culture and position. Poverty offers no protection against such assaults, But the expression, to <span class="accented">know how to walk before the living</span>, means to understand and to follow the correct path of life; to know how to behave properly and uprightly in the intercourse with one's fellow-men; to have what the French call <span class="accented">savoir vivre</span>. (So Volok.) The question must be completed thus: "What advantage has the discreet and properly conducted poor man over the fool?" None, at least in this respect. The poor man, even though he be well vetoed in the rule of life, has insatiable desires which he has to check or conceal, and so is no better off than the fool, who equally is unable to gratify them. The two 'extremities of the social scale are taken  - the rich wise man, and the prudent poor man - and both are shown to fail in enjoying life; and what is true of these must be also true of all that come between these two limits, "the appetite is not filled" (ver. 7).

This is a further confirmation of the misery and unrest that accompany immoderate desires. "The sight of the eyes" means the enjoyment of the present, that which lies before one, in contrast to the restless craving for what is distant, uncertain, and out of reach. The lesson taught is to make the best of existing circumstances, to enjoy the present, to control the roaming of fancy, and to narrow the vast field of appetency. We have a striking expression in Wisd. 4:12, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> by which is denoted the giddiness, the reeling intoxication, caused by unrestrained passion.

Well is it added that this insatiability of the soul, which never leads to contentment, is vanity and vexation of spirit, a feeding on wind, empty, unsatisfying.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it <i>is</i> man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - Section 11. <span class="accented">All things are foreknown and foreordained by God</span>; <span class="accented">it is useless to murmur against or to discuss this great fact</span>; and as the future is beyond our knowledge and control, it is wise to make the best of the present. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That which hath been is named already</span>; better, <span class="accented">whatsoever hath been</span>, <span class="accented">long ago hath its name been given</span>. The word rendered "already," <span class="accented">kebar</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>), "long ago," though used elsewhere in this book of events in human history, may appropriately be applied to the Divine decrees which predetermine the circumstances of man's life. This is its significance in the present passage, which asserts that everything which happens has been known and fixed beforehand, and therefore that man cannot shape his own life. No attempt is here made to reconcile this doctrine with man's free-will and consequent responsibility. The idea has already been presented in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, etc. It comes forth in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>, "Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands?" (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-20.htm">Romans 9:20</a>); <a href="../../par/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a> (according to the Textus Receptus), "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world." The same idea is brought out more fully in the following clauses. Septuagint, "If anything ever was, already hath its name been called," which gives the correct sense of the passage. The Vulgate is not so happy, <span class="accented">Qui futurus est</span>, <span class="accented">jam vocatum est nomen ejus</span>, being rather opposed to the grammar. <span class="cmt_word">And it is known that it is man</span>. What is meant by the Authorized Version is doubtful. If the first clause had been translated, as in the margin of the Revised Version, "Whatsoever he be, his name was given him long ago," the conclusion would come naturally, "and it is known that he is man" (<span class="accented">Adam</span>), and we should see an allusion to man's name and to the ground (adamah) from which he was taken (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>), as if his very name betokened his weakness. But the present version is very obscure. Cox gives, "It is very certain that even the greatest is but a man, and cannot contend with him," etc. But the Hebrew will not admit this rendering. The clause really amplifies the previous statement of man's predetermined destiny, and it should be rendered, "And it is known what a man shall be." Every individual comes under God's prescient superintendence. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "It is known what man is;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et scitur quod homo sit</span>. But it is not the nature of man that is in question, but his conditioned state. <span class="cmt_word">Neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.</span> The <span class="accented">mightier</span> One is God, in accordance with the passages quoted above from Isaiah, Acts, and Romans. Some consider that death is intended, and that the author is referring to the shortness of man's life. They say that the word <span class="accented">taqqiph</span>, "mighty" (which occurs only in Ezra and Daniel), is never used of God. But is it used of death? And is it not used of God in <a href="../../par/daniel/4-3.htm">Daniel 4:3</a> (3:33, Hebrew), where Nebuchadnezzar says, "How mighty are his wonders"? To bring death into consideration is to introduce a new thought having no connection with the context, which is not speaking of the termination of man's life, but of its course, the circumstances of which are arranged by a higher Power. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. With this we may compare <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-22.htm">1 Corinthians 10:22</a>, "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what <i>is</i> man the better?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seeing there be many things that increase vanity</span>. The noun rendered"things" (<span class="accented">dabar</span>) may equally mean "words;" and it is a question which signification is most appropriate here. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, "many words." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">verba sunt plurima</span>. If we take the rendering of the Authorized Version, we must understand the passage to mean that the distractions of business, the cares of life, the constant disappointments, make men feel the hollowness and unsatisfactory nature of labor and wealth and earthly goods, and their absolute dependence upon Providence. But in view of the previous context, and especially of ver. 10, which speaks of contending (<span class="accented">din</span>) with God, it is most suitable to translate <span class="accented">debarim</span> "words," and to understand them of the expressions of impatience, doubt, and unbelief to which men give utterance when arraigning the acts or endeavoring to explain the decrees of God. Such profitless words only increase the perplexity in which men are involved. It is very possible that reference is here made to the discussions on the chief good, free-will, predestination, and the like subjects, which, as we know from Josephus, had begun to be mooted in Jewish schools, as they had long been rife in those of Greece. In these disputes Pharisees and Sadducees took opposite sides. The former maintained that some things, but not all, were the subject of fate (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>), and that certain things were in our own power to do or not to do; that is, while they attribute all that happens to fate, or God's decree, they hold that man has the power of assent, supposing that God tempers all in such sort, that by his ordinance and man's will all things are performed, good or evil. The Sadducees eliminated fate altogether from human actions, and asserted that men are in all things governed, not by any external force, but by their own will alone; that their success and happiness depended upon themselves, and that ill fortune was the consequence of their own folly or stupidity. A third school, the Essenes, held that fate was supreme, and that nothing could happen to mankind beyond or in contravention of its decree ('Joseph. Ant.,' 13:5. 9; 18:1:3, 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 14). Such speculative discussions may have been in Koheleth's mind when he wrote this sentence. Whatever may be the difficulties of the position, we Christians know and feel that in matters of religion and morality we are absolutely free, have an unfettered choice, and that from this fact arises our responsibility. <span class="cmt_word">What is man the better?</span> What profit has man from such speculations or words of skepticism?

Plainly, the Divine prescience of vers. 10, 11 is closely connected with the question of man's ultimate good and his ignorance of the future, enunciated in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">For who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</span> Such discussions are profitless, for man knows not what is his real good - whether pleasure, apathy, or virtue, as philosophers would put it. To decide such questions he must be able to foresee results, which is denied him. The interrogative "Who knows?" is equivalent to an emphatic negative, as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>, and is a common rhetorical form which surely need not be attributed to Pyrrhonism (Plumptre). <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow.</span> These words amplify and explain the term "in life" of the preceding clause. They may be rendered literally, <span class="accented">During the number of the days of the life</span> (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>) <span class="accented">of his vanity</span>, <span class="accented">and he passeth them as a shadow</span>. A life of vanity is one that yields no good result, full of empty aims, unsatisfied wishes, unfulfilled purposes. It is the man who is here compared to the shadow, not his life. So <a href="../../par/job/14-2.htm">Job 14:2</a>, "He fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not," He soon passes away, and leaves no trace behind him. The thought is common.

To know what is best for him, to arrange his present life according to his own wishes and plans, to be able to depend upon his own counsel for all the actions and designs which he undertakes, man should know what is to be after him, what result his labors will have, who and what kind of heir will inherit his property, whether he will leave children to carry on his name, and other facts of the like nature; but as this is all hidden from him, his duty and his happiness is to acquiesce in the Divine government, to enjoy with moderation the goods of life, and to be content with the modified satisfaction which is accorded to him by Divine beneficence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ecclesiastes/7.htm"><title>Ecclesiastes 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ecclesiastes/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ecclesiastes/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ecclesiastes/6.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 6">&#9668;</a> Ecclesiastes 7 <a href="../ecclesiastes/8.htm" title="Ecclesiastes 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">A good name <i>is</i> better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> - <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:8</a>. - Division II.

We employ a metaphor like that in the clause when we speak of a man's reputation having a good or ill odor; and the Hebrews said of ill fame that it stank in the nostrils (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>; see, on the opposite side, Ecclus. 24:15; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And the day of death than the day of one's birth.</span> The thought in this clause is closely connected with the preceding. If a man's life is such that he leaves a good name behind him, then the day of his departure is better than that of his birth, because in the latter he had nothing before him but labor, and trouble, and fear, and uncertainty; and in the former all these anxieties are past, the storms are successfully battled with, the haven is won (see on Ecclesiastes 4:3). According to Solon's well-known maxim, no one can be called happy till he has crowned a prosperous life by a peaceful death (Herod., 1:32; Soph., 'Trachin.,' 1-3; ('Ed. Tyr.,' 1528, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.); as the Greek gnome runs - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Call no man great till thou hast seen him dead."</span> So Ben-Sira, "Judge none blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) before his death; for a man shall be known in his children" (Ecclus. 11:28). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that <i>is</i> the end of all men; and the living will lay <i>it</i> to his heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting.</span> The thought in the last verse leads to the recollection of the circumstances which accompany the two events therein mentioned  - birth and death, feasting and joy, in the first case; sorrow and mourning in the second. In recommending the sober, earnest life, Koheleth teaches that wiser, more enduring lessons are to be learned where grief reigns than in the empty and momentary excitement of mirth and joyousness. The house in question is mourning for a death; and what a long and harrowing business this was is well known (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; Ecclus. 22:10; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>, etc.). Visits of condolence and periodical pilgrimages to groves of departed relatives were considered duties (<a href="../../par/john/11-19.htm">John 11:19, 31</a>), and conduced to the growth in the mind of sympathy, seriousness, and the need of preparation for death. The opposite side, the house of carousal, where all that is serious is put away, leading to such scenes as Isaiah denounces (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>), offers no wise teaching, and produces only selfishness, heartlessness, thoughtlessness. What is said here is no contradiction to what was said in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>, that there was nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and enjoy himself. For Koheleth was not speaking of unrestrained sensualism - the surrender of the mind to the pleasures of the body - but of the moderate enjoyment of the good things of life conditioned by the fear of God and love of one's neighbor. This statement is quite compatible with the view that sees a higher purpose and training in the sympathy with sorrow than in participation in reckless frivolity. <span class="cmt_word">For that is the end of all men</span> viz. that they will some day be mourned, that their house will be turned into a house of mourning. Vulgate, In <span class="accented">illa</span> (<span class="accented">dome</span>) <span class="accented">enim finis cunctorum admonetur hominum</span>, which is not the sense of the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">The living will lay it to his heart.</span> He who has witnessed this scene will consider it seriously (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>), and draw from it profitable conclusions concerning the brevity of life and the proper use to make thereof. We recall the words of Christ, "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted;" and "Woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-4.htm">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-25.htm">Luke 6:25</a>). Schultens gives an Arab proverb which says, "Hearest thou lamentation for the dead, hasten to the spot; art thou called to a banquet, cross not the threshold." The Septuagint thus translates the last clause, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> "The living will put good into his heart;" the Vulgate paraphrases fairly, <span class="accented">Et vivens cogitat quid futurum sit</span>," The living thinks what is to come." "So teach us to number our days," prays the psalmist, "that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom" (<a href="../../par/psalms/90-12.htm">Psalm 90:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">Sorrow <i>is</i> better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sorrow is better than laughter</span>. This is a further expansion of the previous maxim, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (kaas), as contrasted with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;</span>, is rightly rendered "sorrow," "melancholy," or, as Ginsburg contends, "thoughtful sadness." The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">ira</span>; but auger is not the feeling produced by a visit to the house of mourning. Such a scene produces saddening reflection, which is in itself a moral training, and is more wholesome and elevating than thoughtless mirth. <span class="cmt_word">For by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</span> The feeling which shows itself by the look of sadness (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/40-7.htm">Genesis 40:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>) has a purifying effect on the heart, gives a moral tone to the character. Professor Tayler Lewis renders the clause, "For in the sad. ness of the face the heart becometh fair;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. sorrow beautifies the soul, producing, as it were, comeliness, spiritual beauty, and, in the end, serener happiness. The Vulgate translates the passage thus: <span class="accented">Melter eat ira risu</span>; <span class="accented">quia per tristitiam vultus corrigitur animus deliquentis</span>, "Better is anger than laughter, because through sadness of countenance the mind of the offender is corrected." The anger is that either of God or of good men which reproves sin; the laughter is that of sinners who thus show their connivance at or approval of evil. There can be no doubt that this is not the sense of the passage. For the general sentiment concerning the moral influence of grief and suffering, we may compare the Greek sayings, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>; which are almost equivalent in meaning (comp. AEschyl., 'Again.,' 170; Herod., 1:207). The Latins would say, "Quaenocent, docent," and we, "Pain is gain." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">The heart of the wise <i>is</i> in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools <i>is</i> in the house of mirth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning</span>. This is the natural conclusion from what was said in vers. 2, 3. The man who recognizes the serious side of life, and knows where to learn lessons of high moral meaning, will be found conversant with scenes of sorrow and suffering, and reflecting upon them. <span class="cmt_word">But the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</span> The fool, who thinks of nothing but present enjoyment, and how to make life pass pleasantly, turns away from mournful scenes, and goes only there where he may drown care and be thoughtless and merry. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:5</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise.</span> <span class="accented">Gearah</span>, "rebuke," is the word used in Proverbs for the grave admonition which heals and strengthens while it wounds (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/13-1.htm">Proverbs 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>). The silent lessons which a man learns from the contemplation of others' sorrow are rightly supplemented by the salutary correction of the wise man's tongue. <span class="cmt_word">Than for a man to hear the song of fools.</span> <span class="accented">Shir</span>, "<span class="accented">song</span>," is a general term used of sacred or profane song; the connection here with the second clause of ver. 4, etc., leads one to think of the hoister-cue, reckless, often immodest, singing heard in the house of revelry, such as Amos (<a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>) calls "idle songs to the sound of the viol" Koheleth might have heard these in his own country, without drawing his experience from the license of Greek practice or the impurity of Greek lyrics. The Vulgate renders the clause, <span class="accented">Quum stultorum adulatione decipi</span>, Than to be deceived by the flattery of tools." This is a paraphrase; the correctness is negatived by the explanation given in the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so <i>is</i> the laughter of the fool: this also <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot.</span> There is a play of words in the Hebrew, "The crackling of <span class="accented">sirim</span> under <span class="accented">a sir</span>," which Wright expresses by translating, "Like the noise of the nettles under the kettles." In the East, and where wood is scarce, thorns, hay, and stubble are used for fuel (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-9.htm">Psalm 58:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>). Such materials are quickly kindled, blaze up for a time with much noise, and soon die away (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>). So is the laughter of the fool. The point of comparison is the loud crackling and the short duration of the fire with small results. <span class="cmt_word">So the fool's mirth is boisterous and noisy, but comes to a speedy end, and is spent to no good purpose.</span> So in Job (<a href="../../par/job/20-5.htm">Job 20:5</a>) we have, "The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment." All this profitless mirth is again nothing but vanity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The verse begins with <span class="accented">ki</span>, which usually introduces a reason for what has preceded; but the difficulty in finding the connection has led to various explanations and evasions. The Authorized Version boldly separates the verse from what has gone before, and makes a new paragraph beginning with "surely:" <span class="cmt_word">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad.</span> Delitzsch supposes that something has been lost between vers. 6 and 7, and he supplies the gap by a clause borrowed from <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-8.htm">Proverbs 16:8</a>, "Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right;" and then the sentence proceeds naturally, "For oppression," etc. But this is scarcely satisfactory, as it is mere conjecture wholly unsupported by external evidence. The Vulgate leaves <span class="accented">ki</span> untranslated; the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. Looking at the various paragraphs, all beginning with <span class="accented">rob</span>, rendered "better," viz. vers. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, we must regard the present verse as connected with what precedes, a new subject being introduced at ver. 8. Putting ver. 6 in a parenthesis as merely presenting an illustration of the talk of fools, we may see in ver. 7 a confirmation of the first part of ver. 5. The rebuke of the wise is useful even in the case of rulers who are tempted -to excess and injustice. The "oppression" in the text is the exercise of irresponsible power, that which a man inflicts, not what he suffers; this makes him "mad," even though he be in other respects and under other circumstances wise; he ceases to be directed by reason and principle, and needs the correction of faithful rebuke. The Septuagint and Vulgate, rendering respectively <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="accented">calumnia</span>, imply that the evil which distracts the wise man is false accusation. <span class="cmt_word">And a gift destroyeth the heart.</span> The admission of bribery is likewise an evil that calls for wise rebuke. So <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>, "He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live." The phrase, "destroys the heart," means corrupts the understanding, <span class="accented">deprives</span> a man of wisdom, makes him no better than a fool (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>, where the same effect is attributed to whoredom and drunkenness). The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "destroys the heart of his nobility;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">perdet robur cordis illius</span>, "will destroy the strength of his heart." The interpretation given above seems to be the most reasonable way of dealing with the existing text; but Nowack and Volck adopt Delitzsch's emendation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">Better <i>is</i> the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: <i>and</i> the patient in spirit <i>is</i> better than the proud in spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-14.</span> - Section 2. Here follow some <span class="accented">recommendations to patience and resignation under the ordering of God's providence</span>. Such conduct is shown to be true wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof.</span> This is not a repetition of the assertion in ver. I concealing the day of death and the day of birth, but states a truth in a certain sense generally true. The end is better because we then can form a right judgment about a matter; we see what was its purpose; we know whether it has been advantageous and prosperous or not. Christ's maxim, often repeated (see <a href="../../par/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-13.htm">Matthew 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>, etc.), is, "He that shall endure unto the end shall be saved." No one living can be said to be so absolutely safe as that he can look to the great day without trembling. Death puts the seal to the good life, and, obviates the danger of falling away. Of course, if a thing is in itself evil, the gnome is not true (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>, etc.); but applied to things indifferent at the outset, it is as correct as generalizations can be. The lesson of patience is here taught. A man should not be precipitate in his judgments, but wait for the issue. From the ambiguity in the expression <span class="accented">dabar</span> (see on Ecclesiastes 6:11), many render it "word "in this passage. Thus the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Melior est finis orationis</span>, <span class="accented">quam principium</span>; and the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>, or some such word, must be supplied. If this interpretation be preferred, we must either take the maxim as stating generally that few words are better than many, and that the sooner one concludes a speech, so much the better for speaker and hearer; or we must consider that the word intended is a well-merited rebuke, which, however severe and at first disliked, proves in the end wholesome and profitable. <span class="cmt_word">And the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</span> "Patient" is literally "long of spirit," as the phrase, "short of spirit," is used in <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-29.htm">Proverbs 14:29</a> and <a href="../../par/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a> to denote one who loses his temper and is impatient. To wait calmly for the result of an action, not to be hasty in arraigning Providence, is the part of a patient man; while the proud, inflated, conceited man, who thinks all must be arranged according to his notions, is never resigned or content, but rebels against the ordained course of events. "In your patience ye shall win your souls," said Christ (<a href="../../par/luke/21-19.htm">Luke 21:19</a>); and a Scotch proverb declares wisely, "He that weel bides, weel betides." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry.</span> A further warning against the arrogance which murmurs at Providence and revolts against the checks of the Divine arrangement. The injunction in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:2</a> might be taken in this sense. It is not a general admonition against unrighteous anger, but is leveled at the haughty indignation which a proud man feels when things do not go as he wishes, and he deems that he could have managed matters more satisfactorily. <span class="cmt_word">For anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</span> Such unreasonable displeasure is the mark of a foolish or skeptical mind, and if it rests (<a href="../../par/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33</a>), is fostered and cherished there, may develop into misanthropy and atheism. If we adopt the rendering" word" in ver. 8, we may see in this injunction a warning against being quick to take offence at a rebuke, as it is only the fool who will not look to the object of the censure and see that it ought to be patiently submitted to. On the subject of anger St. Gregory writes, "As often as we restrain the turbulent motions of the mind under the virtue of mildness, we are essaying to return to the likeness of our Creator. For when the peace of mind is lashed with anger, torn and rent, as it were, it is thrown into confusion, so that it is not in harmony with itself, and loses the force of the inward likeness. By anger wisdom is parted with, so that we are left wholly in ignorance what to do; as it is written, 'Anger resteth in the bosom of a fool,' in this way, that it withdraws the light of understanding, while by agitating it troubles the mind" ('Moral.,' 5:78). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Say not thou, What is <i>the cause</i> that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The same impatience leads a man to disparage the present in comparison with a past age. <span class="cmt_word">What is the cause that the former days were better than these?</span> He does not know from any adequate information that preceding times were in any respect superior to present, but in his moody discontent he looks on what is around him with a jaundiced eye, and sees the past through a rose-tinted atmosphere, as an age of heroism, faith, and righteousness. Horace finds such a character in the morose old man, whom he describes in 'De Arte Poet.,' 173 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Difficilis, querulus, laudater temporis acti<br />Se puero, castigator censorque minornm."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Morose and querulous, praising former days<br />When he was boy, now ever blaming youth."</span> And 'Epist.,' 2:1.22 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"... et nisi quae terris semota suisque<br />Temporibus defuncta videt, fastidit et odit."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"All that is not most distant and removed<br />From his own time and place, he loathes and scorns."</span> <span class="cmt_word">For thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</span> In asking such a question you show that you have not reflected wisely on the matter. Every age has its light and dark side; the past was not wholly light, the present is not wholly dark. And it may well be questioned whether much of the glamour shed over antiquity is not false and unreal. The days of "Good Queen Bess" were anything but halcyon; the "merrie England" of old time was full of disorder, distress, discomfort. In yearning again for the flesh-pots of Egypt, the Israelites forgot the bondage and misery which were the accompaniments of those sensual pleasures.

To this effect Wright quotes Menander - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Blest is the man who wealth and wisdom hath,<br />For he can use his riches as he ought."</span> (Comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-24.htm">Proverbs 14:24</a>.) Many commentators, thinking such a sentiment alien front the context, render the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> not "with," but "as" Wisdom is [as] good as an inheritance" (see on Ecclesiastes 2:16). This is putting wisdom on rather a low platform, and one would have expected to read some such aphorism as "Wisdom is better than rubies" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>), if Koheleth had intended to make any such comparison. It appears then most expedient to take <span class="accented">im</span> in the sense of "moreover," "as well as," "<span class="accented">and"</span> (camp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>, "ruddy, and (<span class="accented">ira</span>) of a fair countenance"). "Wisdom is good, and an inheritance is good; 'both are good, but the advantages of the former, as ver. 12 intimates, far outweigh those of the latter. <span class="cmt_word">And by it there is profit to them that see the sun</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and an advantage for those that see the</span>, <span class="accented">sun</span>. However useful wealth may be, wisdom is that which is really beneficial to all who live and rejoice in the light of day. In Homer the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;</span>, "to see the light of the sun" ('Iliad,' 18:61), signifies merely "to live;" Plumptre considers it to be used here and in Ecclesiastes 19:7 in order to convey the thought that, after all, life has its bright side. Cox would take it to mean to live much in the sun, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. <span class="accented">to</span> lead an active life - which is an imported modern notion.

The Vulgate explains the obscure text by paraphrasing, <span class="accented">Sieur enirn protegit sapientia</span>, sic <span class="accented">protegit petunia</span>. Shadow, in Oriental phrase, is equivalent to protection (see <a href="../../par/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/17-5.htm">Psalm 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-20.htm">Lamentations 4:20</a>). Wisdom as well as money is a shield and defense to men. As it is said in one passage (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-8.htm">Proverbs 13:8</a>) that riches are the ransom of a man's life, so in another (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:15</a>) we are told how wisdom delivered a city from destruction. The literal translation given above implies that he who has wisdom and he who has money rest under a safe protection, are secure from material evil. In this respect they are alike, and have analogous claims to man's regard. <span class="cmt_word">But the excellency</span> - profit, or advantage - <span class="cmt_word">of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it</span>. "Knowledge" (<span class="accented">daath</span>) and "wisdom" (<span class="accented">chokmah</span>) are practically here identical, the terms being varied for the sake of poetic parallelism. The Revised Version, following Delitzsch and others, renders, <span class="accented">Wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. secures him from passions and excesses which tend to shorten life. This seems to be scarcely an adequate ground for the noteworthy advantage which wisdom is said to possess. The Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> "And the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will quicken him that hath it." Something more than the mere animal life is signified, a climax to the "defense" mentioned in the preceding clause - the higher, spiritual life which man has from God. Wisdom in the highest sense, that is, practical piety and religion, is "a tree of life to them that lay hold of her, and happy is every one that retaineth her" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18</a>), where it is implied that wisdom restores to man the gift which he lost at the Fall (camp. also <a href="../../par/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a>). The Septuagint expression <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> recalls the words of Christ, "As the Father raiseth the dead and quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom he will;" "It is the Spirit that quickeneth (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="../../par/john/5-21.htm">John 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>). Koheleth attributes that power to wisdom which the more definite teaching of Christianity assigns to the influence of the Holy Spirit. Some would explain, "fortifies or vivifies the heart," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. imparts new life and strength to meet every fortune. The Vulgate rendering is far astray from the text, and does not accurately convey the sense of the passage, running thus: <span class="accented">Hoe autem plus habet eruditio et sapientia</span>: <span class="accented">quod vitam tribuunt possessori sue</span>, "But this more have learning and wisdom, that they give life to the possessor of them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">Consider the work of God: for who can make <i>that</i> straight, which he hath made crooked?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Consider the work of God</span>. Here is another reason against murmuring and hasty judgment. True wisdom is shown by submission to the inevitable.

The thought goes back to what was said in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>, "That which is crooked cannot be made straight;" and in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:10</a>, man "cannot contend with him that is mightier than he." "As for the wondrous works of the Lord," says Ben-Sirs," there may be nothing taken from them, neither may anything be put unto them, neither can the ground of them be found out" (Ecclus. 18:6). We cannot arrange events according to our wishes or expectations; therefore not only is placid acquiescence a necessary duty, but the wise man will endeavor to accommodate himself to existing circumstances 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day of prosperity be joyful</span>; literally, <span class="accented">in the day of good be in good i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. when things go well with you, be cheerful (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>); accept the situation and enjoy it. The advice is the same as that which runs through the book, viz. to make the best of the present. So Ben-Sire says, "Defraud not thyself of the good day, and let not a share in a good desire pass thee by" (Ecclus. 14:14). Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;</span>, "In a day of good live in (an atmosphere of) good;" Vulgate, in <span class="accented">die bona fruere bonis</span>, "In a good day enjoy your good things." <span class="cmt_word">But in the day of adversity consider</span>; <span class="accented">in the evil day look well</span>. The writer could not conclude this clause so as to make it parallel with the other, or he would have had to say, "In the ill day take it ill," which would be far from his meaning; so he introduces a thought which may help to make one resigned to adversity. The reflection follows. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et malam diem praecave</span>, "Beware of the evil day." But, doubtless, the object of the verb is the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">God also hath set the one over against the other</span>; or, <span class="accented">God hath made the one corresponding to the other</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. he hath made the day of evil as well as the day of good. The light and shade in man's life are equally under God's ordering and permission. "What?" cries Job (<a href="../../par/job/2-10.htm">Job 2:10</a>), "shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" Corn. Lapide quotes a saying of Plutarch to this effect: the harp gives forth sounds acute and grave, and both combine to form the melody; so in man's life the mingling of prosperity and adversity yields a well-adjusted harmony. God strikes all the strings of our life's harp, and we ought, not only patiently, but cheerfully, to listen to the chords produced by this Divine Performer. <span class="cmt_word">To the end that man should find nothing after him.</span> This clause gives Koheleth's view of God's object in the admixture of good and evil; but the reason has been variously interpreted, the explanation depending on the sense assigned to the term "after him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>). The Septuagint gives <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is vague; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">contra eum</span>, meaning that man may have no occasion to complain against God. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') considers that Koheleth here implies that death closes the scene, and that there is then nothing more to fear, rendering the clause, "On the ground that man is to experience nothing at all hereafter." They who believe that the writer held the doctrine of a future life cannot acquiesce in this view. The interpretation of Delitzsch is this - God lets man pass through the whole discipline of good and evil, that when lie dies there may be nothing which he has not experienced. Hitzig and Nowack explain the text to mean that, as God designs that man after his death shall have done with all things, he sends upon him evil as well as good, that he may not have to punish him hereafter - a doctrine opposed to the teaching of a future judgment. Wright deems the idea to be that man may be kept in ignorance of what shall happen to him beyond the grave, that the present life may afford no clue to the future. One does not see why this should be a comfort, nor how it is compatible with God's known counsel of making the condition of the future life dependent upon the conduct of this. Other explanations being more or less unsatisfactory, many modern commentators see in the passage an assertion that God intermingle8 good and evil in men's lives according to laws with which they are unacquainted, in order that they may not disquiet themselves by forecasting the future, whether in this life or after their death, but may be wholly dependent upon God, casting all their care upon him, knowing that he careth for them (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>). We may safely adopt this explanation (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>).

Koheleth gives his own experience of an anomalous condition which often obtains in human affairs. "All," being here defined by the article, must refer to the cases which he has mentioned or proceeds to mention. "The days of vanity" mean merely "fleeting, vain days" (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>). The expression denotes the writer's view of the emptiness and transitoriness of life (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:2</a>), and it may also have special reference to his own vain efforts to solve the problems of existence. <span class="cmt_word">There is a just</span> (<span class="accented">righteous</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>man that perisheth in his righteousness</span>. Here is a difficulty about the dispensation of good and evil, which has always perplexed the thoughtful. It finds expression in <a href="../../par/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>, though the singer propounds a solution (ver. 17) which Koheleth misses. The meaning of the preposition (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) before "righteousness" is disputed. Delitzsch, Wright, and others take it as equivalent to "in spite of," as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-32.htm">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>, where "in this thing" means "notwithstanding," "for all this thing." Righteousness has the promise of long life and prosperity; it is an anomaly that it should meet with disaster and early death. We cannot argue from this that the author did not believe in temporal rewards and punishments; he states merely certain of his own experiences, which may be abnormal and capable of explanation. For his special purpose this was sufficient. Others take the preposition to mean "through," "in consequence of." Good men have always been persecuted for righteousness' sake (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>), and so far the interpretation is quite admissible, and is perhaps supported by ver. 16, which makes a certain sort of righteousness the cause of disaster. But looking to the second clause of the present verse, where we can hardly suppose that the wicked man is said to attain to long life in consequence of his wickedness, we are safe in adopting the rendering, "in spite of." <span class="cmt_word">There is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in</span> (<span class="accented">in spite of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his wickedness</span>.

According to the moral government of God experienced by the Hebrews in their history, the sinner was to suffer calamity and to be cut off prematurely. This is the contention of Job's friends, against which he argues so warmly. The writer of the Book of Wisdom has learned to look for the correction of such anomalies in another life. He sees that length of days is not always a blessing, and that retribution awaits the evil beyond the grave (Wisd. 1:9 Wisd. 3:4, 10 Wisd. 4:8, 19, etc.). Abel perished in early youth; Cain had his days prolonged. This apparent inversion of moral order leads to another reflection concerning the danger of exaggerations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:16</a></div><div class="verse">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not righteous over much</span>. The exhortation has been variously interpreted to warn against too scrupulous observance of ritual and ceremonial religion, or the mistaken piety which neglects all mundane affairs, or the Pharisaical spirit which is bitter in condemning others who fall short of one's own standard. Cox will have it that the advice signifies that a prudent man will not be very righteous, since he will gain nothing by it, nor very wicked, as he will certainly shorten his life by such conduct. But really Koheleth is condemning the tendency to immoderate asceticism which had begun to show itself in his day - a rigorous, prejudiced, indiscreet manner of life and conduct which made piety offensive, and afforded no real aid to the cause of religion. This arrogant system virtually dictated the laws by which Providence should be governed, and found fault with divinely ordered circumstances if they did not coincide with its professors' preconceived opinions. Such religionism might well be called being "righteous over much." <span class="cmt_word">Neither make thyself over wise</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque plus sapias quam necesse est</span>; better, <span class="accented">show not thyself too wise</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. do not indulge in speculations about God's dealings, estimating them according to your own predilections, questioning the wisdom of his moral government. Against such perverse speculation St. Paul argues (<a href="../../par/romans/9-19.htm">Romans 9:19</a>, etc.). "Thou wilt say unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus?" A good principle carried to excess may bring evil results. <span class="accented">Summum jus</span>, <span class="accented">summa injuria</span>. The maxim, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, Ne <span class="accented">quid nimis</span>, "Moderation in all things," is taught here; and Aristotle's theory of virtue being the mean between the two extremes of excess and defect is adumbrated ('Ethic. Nicom.,' 2:6. 15, 16): though we do not see that the writer is "reproducing current Greek thought" (Plumptre), or that independent reflection and observation could not have landed him at the implied conclusion without plagiarism. <span class="cmt_word">Why shouldest thou destroy thyself</span>? Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;</span>, "Lest perchance thou be confounded;" Vulgate, Ne <span class="accented">obstupescas</span>, "Lest thou be stupefied." This is the primary meaning of the special form of the verb here used (hithp. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span>), and Plumptre supposes that the author intends thereby to express the spiritual pride which accompanies fancied excellence in knowledge and conduct, and by which the possessor is puffed up (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-6.htm">1 Timothy 3:6</a>). But plainly it is not a mental, internal effect that is contemplated, but something that affects comfort, position, or life, like the corresponding clause in the following verse. Hitzig and Ginsburg explain the word, "Make thyself forsaken," "Isolate thyself," which can scarcely be the meaning. The Authorized Version is correct. A man who professes to be wiser than others, and. indeed, wiser than Providence, incurs the envy and animosity of his fellow-men, and will certainly be punished by God for his arrogance and presumption. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a></div><div class="verse">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish.</span> These two injunctions are parallel and correlative to those in ver. 16 concerning over-righteousness and over-wisdom. But the present verse cannot be meant, as at first sight it seems to do, to sanction a certain amount of wickedness provided it does not exceed due measure. To surmount this difficulty some have undeavored to modify the term "wicked" (<span class="accented">rasha</span>), taking it to mean "engaged in worldly matters," or "not subject to rule," "lax," or again "restless," as some translate the word in <a href="../../par/job/3-17.htm">Job 3:17</a>. But the word seems not to be used in any such senses, and bears uniformly the uncompromising signification assigned to it, "to be wicked, unrighteous, guilty." The difficulty is not overcome by Plumptre's suggestion of the introduction of a little "playful irony learned from Greek teachers," as if Koheleth meant, "I have warned you, my friends, against over-righteousness, but do not jump at the conclusion that license is allowable. That was very far from my meaning." The connection of thought is this: in the previous verse Koheleth had denounced the Pharisaical spirit which virtually condemned the Divine ordering of circumstances, because vice was not at once and visibly punished, and virtue at once rewarded; and now he proceeds to warn against the deliberate and abominable wickedness which infers from God's long-suffering his absolute neglect and non- interference in mortal matters, and on this view plunges audaciously into vice and immorality, saying to itself, "God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it" (<a href="../../par/psalms/10-11.htm">Psalm 10:11</a>). Such conduct may well be called "foolish;" it is that of "the fool who says in his heart, There is no God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). The actual wording of the injunction sounds to us somewhat strange; but its form is determined by the requirements of parallelism, and the aphorism must not be pressed beyond its general intention, "Be not righteous nor wise to excess; be not wicked nor foolish to excess." Septuagint, "Be not very wicked, and be not stubborn (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)." Why shouldest thou die before thy time? literally, <span class="accented">not in thy time</span>; prematurely, tempting God to punish thee by retributive judgment, or shortening thy days by vicious excesses. (For the former, see <a href="../../par/job/22-16.htm">Job 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31, 33</a>; and for the latter, <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23-27</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-21.htm">Proverbs 10:21</a>.) The Syriac contains a clause not given in any other version, "that thou mayest not be hated." As is often the case, both in this book and in Proverbs, a general statement in one place <span class="accented">is reduced</span> by a contrariant or modified opinion in another. Thus the prolongation of the life of the wicked, noticed in ver. 15, is here shown to be abnormal, impiety in the usual course of events having a tendency to shorten life. In this way hasty generalization is corrected, and the Divine arrangement is vindicated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:18</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It is</i> good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand.</span> The pronouns refer to the two warnings in vers. 16 and 17 against over-righteousness and over-wicked-ness. Koheleth does not advise a man to make trial of opposite lines of conduct, to taste the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that from a wide experience lie may, like a man of the world, pursue a <span class="accented">safe</span> course; <span class="accented">this</span> would be poor <span class="accented">morality</span>, and unmeet for the stage at which his argument has arrived. Rather he advises him to lay to heart fire cautions above given, and learn from them to avoid all extremes. As Horace <span class="accented">says</span> ('Epist.,' 1:18. 9) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Virtus est medium vitiorum et utrinque reductum."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Folly, as usual, in extremes is seen,<br />While virtue nicely hits the happy mean."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) The Vulgate has interpolated a word, and taken the pronoun as masculine, to the sacrifice of the sense and connection: <span class="accented">Bonum est te sustentare justum</span>, <span class="accented">sed el ab illo ne subtrahas manum tuam</span>, "<span class="accented">It</span> is good that thou shouldst support the just man, nay, from him withdraw not thy hand." <span class="cmt_word">For he that feareth God shall come forth of them all</span>; shall escape both extremes together with their evil re-suits. The fear of God will keep a man from all excesses. The intransitive verb <span class="accented">yatsa</span>, "to go forth," is here used with an accusative (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/44-4.htm">Genesis 44:4</a>, which, however, is not quite analogous), as in Latin <span class="accented">ingrediurbem</span> (Livy, 1:29). Vulgate, <span class="accented">Qui timet Deum nihil negligit</span>. So Hitzig and Ginsburg, "<span class="accented">Goes</span>, makes his way with both," knows how to avail himself of piety and wickedness, which, as we have seen, is not the meaning. St. <span class="accented">Gregory</span>, <span class="accented">indeed</span>, who uses the Latin Version, notes that to fear God is never to pass over any good thing that ought to be aerie ('Moral.,' 1:3); but he is not professing to comment on the whole passage. Wright, after Delitzsch, takes the term "come out of" as equivalent to "fulfill," so that the meaning <span class="accented">would be</span>, "He who fears God performs all the duties mentioned above, and avoids extremes," as <a href="../../par/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, "These ought ye to have done, and not to have left the other undone." But this is confessedly a Talmudic use of the verb; and the Authorized Version may be safely adopted. The Septuagint gives, "For to them that fear God all things shall come forth well."

The spiritual and moral force of <span class="accented">the</span> wisdom grounded upon the fear of God is here signified, and is all the more insisted upon to counteract any erroneous impression conveyed by the caution against over-wisdom in ver. 16 (see note on ver. 17, at the end). <span class="cmt_word">More than ten mighty men which are in the city.</span> The number <span class="accented">ten indicates completeness</span>, <span class="accented">containing in it</span>self the whole arithmetical system, and used representatively for an indefinite multitude. Thus Job (Job 19:3) complains that his friends have reproached him ten times, and Elkanah asks his murmuring wife, "Am I not better to thee than ten sons?" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-8.htm">1 Samuel 1:8</a>). Delitzsch thinks that some definite political arrangement is referred to, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the dynasties placed by Persian kings over conquered countries; and Tyler notes that in the Mishna a city is defined to be a place containing ten men of leisure; and we know that ten men were required for the establishment of a synagogue in any locality. The same idea was present in the Angle-Saxon arrangement of <span class="accented">tything</span> and <span class="accented">hundred</span>. The number, however, is probably used indefi<span class="accented">nitely</span> here as <span class="accented">seven in the</span> parallel passage of Ecclesiasticus (37:14), "<span class="accented">A</span> man's mind is sometime wont to tell him more than seven watchmen that sit above in a high tower."

You will not pay serious attention to evil reports either about yourself or others, nor regulate your views and actions according to such distortions of the truth. To be always hankering to know what people say of us is to set up a false standard, which will assuredly lead us astray; and, at the same time, we shall expose ourselves to the keen-eat mortification when we find, as we probably shall find, that they do not take us at our own valuation, but have thoroughly marked our weaknesses, and are ready enough to censure them. We have an instance of patience under unmerited reproof in the case of David when cursed by Shimei (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a>), as he, or one like minded, says (<a href="../../par/psalms/38-13.htm">Psalm 38:13</a>), "I, as a deaf man, hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs."

Commentators appositely quote Bacon's remarks on this passage in his 'Advancement of Learning,' 8:2, where he notes the prudence of Pompey, who burned all the papers of Sertorius reread, containing, as they did, information which would fatally have compromised many leading men in Rome.

The fact that we often speak ill of others should make us less open to take offence at what is said of ourselves, and prepared to expect unfavorable comments.

Deep - a deep - oh, who can find?" and explains "the past" to mean, not merely the earthly past historically unknown, but the great past before the creation of the universe, the kingdom of all eternities with its ages of ages, its worlds of worlds, its mighty evolutions, its infinite variety. We prefer to retain the rendering, "that which is," and to refer the expression to the phenomenal world. It is not the essence of wisdom that is spoken of, but the facts of man's life and the circumstances in which he finds himself, the course of the world, the phenomena of nature, etc. These things  - their causes, connection, interdependence  - we cannot explain satisfactorily (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a>).

'I said, I will be wise, and it (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>) was far from me, far beyond what was (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>), and deep depth: who shall find it out?" (For the epithet "deep" applied to what is recondite or what is beyond human comprehension, comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-5.htm">Proverbs 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/11-8.htm">Job 11:8</a>.)

We have the expression, "tamed myself," referring to a new investigation in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-20.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:20</a> and elsewhere; but the distinguishing the heart or soul from the man himself is not common in Scripture (see on ch. 11:9), though the soul is sometimes apostrophized, as in <a href="../../par/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-1.htm">Psalm 103:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/146-1.htm">Psalm 146:1</a>). The writer here implies that he gave up himself with all earnestness to the investigation. Unsatisfactory as his quest had been hitherto. He did not relinquish the pursuit, but rather turned it in another direction, where he could hope to meet with useful results. The Septuagint has, "I and my heart traveled round (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) to know;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Lustravi universa animo meo ut scirem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And to search, and to seek out wisdom.</span> The accumulation of synonymous verbs is meant to emphasize the author's devotion to his self-imposed task and his return from profitless theoretical investigation to practical inquiry. <span class="cmt_word">And the reason of things.</span> <span class="accented">Cheshbon</span> (ver. 27; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>) is rather "account," "reckoning," than "reason " - the summing-up of all the facts and circumstances rather than the elucidation of their causes. Vulgate, <span class="accented">rationem</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

His investigation led him to this conclusion, that all infringement of God's laws is a misjudging aberration - a willful desertion of the requirements of right reason - and that mental and moral obtuseness is a physical malady which may be called madness (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a></div><div class="verse">And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart <i>is</i> snares and nets, <i>and</i> her hands <i>as</i> bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - One practical result of his quest Koheleth cannot avoid mentioning, though it comes with a suddenness which is somewhat startling. <span class="cmt_word">And I find more bitter than death the woman</span>. Tracing men's folly and madness to their source, he finds that they arise generally from the seductions of the female sex. Beginning with Adam, woman has continued to work mischief in the world. "Of the woman came the beginning of sin," says Siracides, "and through her we all die" (Ecclus. 25:24); it was owing to her that the punishment of death was inflicted on the human race. If Solomon himself were speaking, he had indeed a bitter experience of the sin and misery into which women lead their victims (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1, 4, 11</a>). It may be thought that Koheleth refers here especially to "the strange woman" of <a href="../../par/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a>, etc.; Proverbs 5:3, etc.; but in ver. 28 he speaks of the whole sex without qualification; so that we must conclude that he had a very low opinion of them. It is no ideal personage whom he is introducing; it is not a personification of vice or folly; but woman in her totality, such as he knew her to be in Oriental courts and homes, denied her proper position, degraded, uneducated, all natural affections crushed or undeveloped, the plaything of her lord, to be flung aside at any moment. It is not surprising that Koheleth's impression of the female sex should be unfavorable. He is not singular in such an opinion. One might fill a large page with proverbs and gnomes uttered in disparagement of woman by men of all ages and countries. Men, having the making of such apothegms, have used their license unmercifully; if the maligned sex had equal liberty, the tables might have been reversed. But, really, in this as in other cases the mean is the safest; and practically those who have given the darkest picture of women have not been slow to recognize the brighter side. If. for instance, the Book of Proverbs paints the adulteress and the harlot in the soberest, most appalling colors, the same book affords us such a sketch of the virtuous matron as is unequalled for vigor, truth, and high appreciation. And if, as in our present chapter, Koheleth shows a bitter feeling against the evil side of woman's nature, he knows how to value the comfort of married life (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:8</a>), and to look upon a good wife as one who makes a man's home happy (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a>). Since the incarnation of our blessed Lord Jesus Christ, "the Seed of the woman," we have learned to regard woman in her true light, and to assign her that position to which she is entitled, giving honor unto her as the weaker vessel, and, at the same time, heir with us of the glorious hope and destiny of our renewed nature (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whose heart is snares and nets</span>; more accurately, <span class="accented">who is snares</span>, <span class="accented">and nets in her heart</span>; Septuagint, "The woman who is a snare, and her heart nets;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quae laqueus venatorum est</span>, <span class="accented">et sagena cot ejus</span>.

The conclusion at which he did arrive was something utterly different from what he had hoped to achieve.

Man has thus abased his free-will, and employed the inventive faculty with which he was endowed in excoriating evil (<a href="../../par/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). How this state of things came about, how the originally good man became thus wicked, the writer does not tell.

The thought is not, as in <a href="../../par/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-12.htm">Jeremiah 9:12</a>, "Who is wise?" but - No one Call be compared with a wise man; he has no compeer. <span class="cmt_word">And who</span> [like him] <span class="cmt_word">knoweth the interpretation of a thing?</span> Who, so well as the wise man, understands the proper relation of circumstances, sees into human affairs and God's dispensations in the case of nations and individuals? Such a one takes the right view of life. The word <span class="accented">pesher</span>, "interpretation," occurs (<span class="accented">peshar</span>) continually in Daniel, and nowhere else and is Chaldaic. The Vulgate, which connects these two clauses with <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7</a>, renders, <span class="accented">Quis cognovit solutionem verbi?</span> So the Septuagint. The "word" or "saying" may be the question proposed above Concerning the happy life, or the proverb that immediately follows. But <span class="accented">dabar</span> is better rendered "thing," as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "will enlighten, illuminate." The serene light within makes itself visible in the outward expression; the man is contented arid cheerful, and shows this in his look and bearing. This is an additional praise of wisdom. Thus Ecclus. 13:25, 26, "The heart of man changeth his countenance, whether it be for good or evil. A cheerful countenance is a token of a heart that is in prosperity." Cicero, 'De Orat.,' 3:57, "Omnes enim motus animi suum quemdam a natura habet vultum et sonum et gestum; corpusque totum homiuis et ejus omnis vultus omnesque voces, ut nervi in fidibus, ita sonant, ut motu animi quoque sunt pulsae." <span class="cmt_word">And the boldness of his face shall be changed</span>. The word translated "boldness" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span>, which means properly "strength," and is best taken of the coarseness and impudence engendered by ignorance and want of culture. Wisdom, when it fills the heart, changes the countenance to an open genial look, which wins confidence and love. Delitzsch refers to the well-worn lines of Ovid, 'Epist.,' 2:9. 47 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Adde, quod ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes<br />Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros."</span> The Septuagint, "And a man shameless in countenance will be hated," shows an alteration in the text, and does not agree with the context. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et potentissimus faciem illius commutabit</span>, "And the Almighty will change his face," where again the text is not accurately followed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>counsel thee</i> to keep the king's commandment, and <i>that</i> in regard of the oath of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment</span>. The pronoun <span class="accented">I</span> stands in the Hebrew without a verb (the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ego os regis observo</span>, is not warranted by the grammar of the clause), and some take it as the answer to the question in ver. 1, "Who is like the wise man?" I, who am now teaching you. But it is better to regard the pronoun as emphasizing the following rule, supplying some verb (which may possibly have dropped out of the text), as, "Say, advise - I, for my part, whatever others may do or advise, I counsel thee;" the injunction being given in the imperative mood. The Septuagint and Syriac omit the pronoun altogether. The warning implies that the writer was living under kingly, and indeed despotic, government, and it was the part of a wise man to exhibit cheerful obedience. Ben-Sira observes that wise men teach us how to serve great men (Ecclus. 8:8). Such conduct is not only prudent, but really a religious- duty, even as the prophets counsel submission to Assyrian and Chaldean rulers (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>). The liege lord, being God's vicegerent, must be reverenced and obeyed. St. Paul, though he does not quote Ecclesiastes, may have had this passage in mind when he wrote (<a href="../../par/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>), "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God," etc.; and (ver. 5), "Ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake." The "king" in the text is understood by some to mean God, but the following clause renders this improbable, and it is wisdom in its political aspect that is here regarded. <span class="cmt_word">And that in regard of the oath of God.</span> The <span class="accented">ray</span> is explicative; "in regard of," or "because of," as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:18</a>. "The oath of God" is the oath of allegiance to the king, taken in the name of God, under his invocation (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-43.htm">1 Kings 2:43</a>). So we read (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-17.htm">2 Kings 11:17</a>) of a covenant between king and people, and people and king, in the time of Jehoiada; Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear by God to be his vassal (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>); and Josephus ('Ant.,' 12:1; 11:8. 3) relates that Ptolemy Soter, son of Lagus (following herein the example of Darius), exacted an oath from the Jews in Egypt to be true to him and his successors. We know that both Babylonian and Persian monarchs exacted an oath of fealty from conquered nations, making them swear by the gods whom they worshipped, the selection of deities being left to them, 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Further advice concerning political behavior. <span class="cmt_word">Be not hasty to go out of his</span> (the king's) <span class="cmt_word">sight</span>. Do not, from some hasty impulse, or induced by harsh treatment, cast off your allegiance to your liege lord. We have the phrase, "go away," in the sense of quitting of service or desertion of a duty, in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>. So St. Peter urges servants to be subject unto their masters, "not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>). Solomon might have given this advice to the Israelites who were ready to follow Jeroboam's lead; though they could have remained loyal to Rehoboam only from high religious motives. But it is better to bear even a heavy yoke than to rebel. The Septuagint has, "Be not hasty; thou shalt go from his presence" - which seems to mean, "Be not impatient, and all will be well." But the authorized rendering is correct (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:4</a>). We may quote Mendelssohn's comment cited by Chance on <a href="../../par/job/34-16.htm">Job 34:16</a>, "This is a great rule in politics, that the people must have no power to pronounce judgment upon the conduct of a king, whether it be good or bad; for the king judges the people, and not the reverse; and if it were not for this rule, the country would never be quiet, and without rebels against the king and his law." <span class="cmt_word">Stand not in an evil thing</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">Neque permaneas in opere malo</span>, "Persist not in an evil affair." But the verb here implies rather the engaging in a matter than continuing an undertaking already begun. The "affair" is conspiracy, insurrection; and Koheleth warns against entering upon and taking part in any such attempt. This seems to be the correct explanation of the clause; but it is, perhaps intentionally, ambiguous, and is capable of other interpretations. Thus Ginsburg, "Do not stand up (in a passion) because of an evil word." Others, "Obey not a sinful command," or "Hesitate not at an evil thing," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. if the king orders it. Wordsworth, referring to <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>. renders, "Stand not in the way of sinners," which seems to be unsuitable to the context. The Septuagint gives, "Stand not in an evil word" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, perhaps "matter"). The reason for the injunction follows. <span class="cmt_word">For he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</span> The irresponsible power of a despotic monarch is here signified, though the terms are applicable (as some, indeed, take them as alone appertaining) to God himself (but see <a href="../../par/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>). The Septuagint combines with this clause the commencement of the following verse, "For he will do whatsover he pleases, even as a king using authority (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." Some manuscripts add <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "he speaks." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">Where the word of a king <i>is, there is</i> power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Where the word of a king is, there is power.</span> A further confirmation of the last thought. More accurately, "Inasmuch as the word of a king is powerful" (<span class="accented">shilton</span>, ver. 8). This last word is used in Daniel (Daniel 3:2) for "a lord," or "ruler." The king does as he thinks fit because his mandate is all-powerful, and must be obeyed, <span class="cmt_word">And who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span> The same expression is found applied to God (<a href="../../par/job/9-12.htm">Job 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>; Wisd. 12:12). The absolute authority of a despot is spoken of in the same terms as the irresistible power of Almighty God. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:5</a></div><div class="verse">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing</span>. This is an encouragement to obedience to royal authority (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-3.htm">Romans 13:3</a>). The context plainly shows that it is not God's commandment that is spoken of (though, of course, the maxim would be very true in this case), but the king's. Nor is it necessarily a servile and unreasoning obedience that is enjoined. Koheleth is dealing with generals. Such cases as that of Daniel and the three children, where obedience would have been sinful, are not here taken into consideration. "Shall feel," literally, "shall know," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. experience no physical evil. Quiet submission to the powers that be guarantees a peaceful and happy life. Ginsburg and others translate, "knoweth not an evil word," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. is saved from abuse and reproach, which seems somewhat meager, though the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate is better, <span class="accented">Non experietur quidquam malt<span class="cmt_word"></span>. And a wise man's heart discerneth</span> (<span class="accented">knoweth</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>both time and judgment.</span> The verb is the same in both clauses, and ought to have been so translated. The "heart" includes the moral as well as the intellectual faculties; and the maxim says that the wise man bears oppression and remains unexcited even in evil days, because he is convinced that there is a time of judgment coming when all will be righted (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>). The certainty of retributive justice is so strong in his mind that he does not resort to rebellion in order to rectify matters, but possesses his soul in patience, leaving the correction of abuses in God's hands. Septuagint, "The wise man's heart knoweth the time of judgment," making a hendiadys of the two terms. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">tempus et responsionem</span>, "time and answer." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:6</a></div><div class="verse">Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man <i>is</i> great upon him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>. This and the three following clauses all begin with <span class="accented">ki</span>, "since," "for," and the conjunction ought to have been similarly rendered in all the places. Thus here, for <span class="cmt_word">to every purpose there is time and judgment</span>. Here commences a chain of argument to prove the wisdom of keeping quiet under oppression or evil rulers. Everything has its appointed time of duration, and in due course will be brought to judgment (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1, 17</a>; 41:14). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (for) <span class="cmt_word">the misery of man is great upon him</span>. This is a further reason, but its exact signification is disputed. Literally, <span class="accented">the evil of the man is heavy upon him</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:1</a>). This may mean, as in the Authorized Version, that the affliction which subjects suffer at the hand of a tyrant becomes insupportable, and calls for and receives God's interposition. Or "the evil" may be the wickedness of the despot, which presses heavily upon him, and under retributive justice will ere long bring him to the ground, and so the oppression will come to an end. This seems to be the most natural interpretation of the passage. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "For the knowledge of a man is great upon him." Though what tiffs means it is difficult to say. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he knoweth not that which shall be</span>. The subject may be man in general, or more probably the evil tyrant. The clause contains a third reason for patience. The despot cannot foresee the future, and goes on blindly filling up the measure of his iniquity, being unable to take any precautions against his inevitable fate (<a href="../../par/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22</a>). <span class="accented">Quem Deus vult perdere prius dementat</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For who can tell him when it shall be</span>? rather, <span class="accented">how it shall be</span>. The fourth portion of the argument. The infatuated man knows not the time when the blow will fall, nor, as here, the manner in which the retribution will come, the form which it will take. Septuagint," For how it shall be, who will tell him?" The Vulgate paraphrases inaccurately, <span class="accented">Quia ignorat prae-terita, et futura nullo scire potest nuntio</span>, "Because he knoweth not the past, and the future he can ascertain by no messenger." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a></div><div class="verse"><i>There is</i> no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither <i>hath he</i> power in the day of death: and <i>there is</i> no discharge in <i>that</i> war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - This verse gives the conclusion of the line of argument which confirms the last clause of ver. 5. There is <span class="cmt_word">no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit.</span> If we take "spirit" in the sense of "the breath of life," explaining the clause to mean that the mightiest despot has no power to retain life when his call comes, we have the same thought repeated virtually in the next clause. It is therefore bettor to take <span class="accented">ruach</span> in the sense of "wind" (<a href="../../par/genesis/8-1.htm">Genesis 8:1</a>). No one can control the course of the wind or know its way (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/11-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:5</a>, where the same ambiguity exists; <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-4.htm">Proverbs 30:4</a>). Koheleth gives here four impossibilities which point to the conclusion already given. The first is man's inability to check the viewless wind or to know whence it comes or whither it goes (<a href="../../par/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>). Equally impotent is the tyrant to influence the drift of events that is bearing him on to his end. God's judgments are often likened to a wind (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-16.htm">Isaiah 41:16</a>; Wisd. 4:4 Wisd. 5:23). <span class="cmt_word">Neither hath he power in the day of death</span>; rather, <span class="accented">over the day of death</span>. The second impossibility concerns the averting the hour of death. Whether it comes by sickness, or accident, or design, the despot must succumb; he can neither foresee nor ward it off (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-10.htm">1 Samuel 26:10</a>, "The Lord shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle, and perish;" Ecclus. 14:12, "Remember that death will not be long in coming, and that the covenant of the grave is not showed unto thee"). <span class="cmt_word">And there is no discharge in that war</span>. The word rendered "discharge" (<span class="accented">mishlachath</span>) is found elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-49.htm">Psalm 78:49</a>, where it is translated "sending," "mission," or "band." The Septuagint here has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>; the Vulgate <span class="accented">Nec sinitur quiescere ingruente bello</span>. The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, though there is no need to insert the pronoun "that." The severity of the law of military service is considered analogously with the inexorable law of death. The Hebrew enactment (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5-8</a>) allowed exemption in certain cases; but the Persian rule was inflexibly rigid, permitting no furlough or evasion during an expedition. Thus we read that when (Eobazus, the father of three sons, petitioned Darius to leave him one at home, the tyrant replied that he would leave him all three, and had them put to death. Again, Pythius, a Lydian, asking Xerxes to exempt his eldest son from accompanying the army to Greece, was reviled by the monarch in unmeasured terms, and was punished for his presumption by seeing his son slain before his eyes, the body divided into two pieces, and placed on either side of the road by which the army passed, that all might be warned of the fate awaiting any attempt to evade military service (Herod., 4:84; 7:35). The passage in the text has a bearing on the authorship and date of our book, is as seems most probable, the reference is to the cruel discipline of Persia. This is the third impossibility; the fourth follows. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it</span>; its lord and master. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "its votary." Ginsburg translates <span class="accented">resha</span> "cunning;" but this seems foreign to the sentiment, which is concerned with the despot's impiety, injustice, and general wickedness, not with the means by which he endeavors to escape the reward of his deeds. The fact is, no evil despot, however reckless and imperious, can go long unpunished. He may say in his heart, "There is no God," or, "God hideth his face, and sees him not," but certain retribution awaits him, and may not be avoided. Says the gnome - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Heaven drives the evil always unto judgment"</span>

He gained this experience by giving his mind to the consideration of men's actions. <span class="cmt_word">There is a</span> <span class="cmt_word">time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</span> This version is certainly incorrect. A new sentence is not commenced here, but the clause is closely connected with what precedes; and "his own hurt" should he "his [equivocally] hurt." Thus Wright and Volck: "All this have I seen, even by applying my heart to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when man ruleth over man to his hurt." Most modern commentators consider that the hurt is that of the oppressed subject; but it is possible that the sense is intentionally ambiguous, and the injury may be that which the despot inflicts, and that which he has to suffer. Both these have been signified above. There is no valid reason for making, as Cox does, this last clause commence ver. 10, and rendering, "But there is a time when a man ruleth over men to their hurt."

Koheleth is troubled by apparent anomalies in God's moral government. He notes <span class="accented">the prosperity of the godless and the misery of the righteous</span>, God's abstention and the seeming impunity of sinners make men incredulous of Providence; but God is just in reward and punishment, as the end will prove. Meantime, returning to his old maxim, he advises men patiently to acquiesce in things as they are, and to make the best of life. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And so</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>); then, in like manner, under the same circumstances (<a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). The writer notes some apparent exceptions to the law of retribution of which he has just been speaking, the double particle at the beginning of the verse implying the connection with the preceding statement. <span class="cmt_word">I saw the wicked buried</span>. "The wicked" are especially the despots (ver. 9). These are carried to their graves with every outward honor and respect, like the rich man in the parable, who "died, and was buried" (<a href="../../par/luke/16-22.htm">Luke 16:22</a>). Such men, if they had received their due reward, far from having a pompous and magnificent funeral (which would befit only a good and honored life), would have been buried with the burial of an ass (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-19.htm">Jeremiah 22:19</a>). So far the Authorized Version is undeniably correct. What follows is as certainly inaccurate as it is unintelligible. <span class="cmt_word">Who had come and gone from the place of the holy</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and they came, and from the place of the holy they went</span>. The first verb seems to mean, "they came to their rest," they died a natural death. The words, in themselves ambiguous, are explained by the connection in which they stand (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-2.htm">Isaiah 57:2</a>). Wright renders, "they came into being," and explains it with the following clause, "they went away from the holy place," as one generation coming and another going, in constant succession. But if, as we suppose, the paragraph applies to the despot, such an interpretation is unsuitable. Cox's idea, that oppressive despots "come again" in the persons of their wicked children, is wholly unsupported by the text. The verse admits and has received a dozen explanations differing more or less from one another. A good deal depends upon the manner in which the succeeding clause is translated, <span class="cmt_word">And they were forgotten in the city where they had so done.</span> As the particle rendered "so" (<span class="accented">ken</span>) may also mean "well," "rightly," we get the rendering, "even such as acted justly," and thus introduce a contrast between the fate of the wicked man who is honored with a sumptuous funeral, and that of the righteous whose name is cast out as pollution and soon forgotten. So Cheyne ('Job and Solomon') gives, "And in accordance with this I have seen ungodly men honored, and that too in the holy place (the temple, <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), but those who had acted rightly had to depart, and were forgotten in the city." Against this interpretation, which has been adopted by many, it may reasonably be urged that in the same verse <span class="accented">ken</span> would hardly be used in two different senses, and that there is nothing in the text to indicate a change of subject. It seems to me that the whole verse applies to the wicked man. He dies in peace, he leaves the holy place; the evil that he has done is forgotten in the very city where he had so done, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> done wickedly. "The place of the holy" is Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/isaiah/48-2.htm">Isaiah 48:2</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>) or the temple (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>). He is removed by death from that spot, the very name of which ought to have cried shame on his crimes and impiety. The expression seems to picture a great procession of priests and Levites accompanying the corpse of the deceased tyrant to the place of burial, while the final clause implies that no long lamentation was made over him, no monument erected to his memory (see the opposite of this in the treatment of Josiah, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24, 25</a>). They who consider "the righteous " to be the subject of the last clauses see in the words, "from the holy place they departed," an intimation that these were excommunicated from the synagogue or temple, or banished from the promised land, on account of their opinions. I would translate the passage thus: <span class="accented">In like manner have I seen the wicked buried, and they came to their rest, and they went from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city where they had so</span> (wickedly) acted. The versions have followed various readings. Thus the Septuagint: "And then I saw the impious brought unto graves, and from the holy place; and they departed and were praised in the city, because they had so done;" Vulgate, "I have seen the impious buried, who also, while they still lived, were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as if men of just doings." Commenting oh this version, St. Gregory writes, "The very tranquility of the peace of the Church conceals many under the Christian name who are beset with the plague of their own wickedness. But if a light breath of persecution strikes them, it sweeps them away at once as chaff from the threshing-floor. But some persons wish to bear the mark of Christian calling, because, since the name of Christ has been exalted on high, nearly all persons now look to appear faithful, and from seeing others called thus, they are ashamed not to seem faithful themselves; but they neglect to be that which they beast of being called. For they assume the reality of inward excellence, to adorn their outward appearance; and they who stand before the heavenly Judge, naked from the unbelief of their heart, are clothed, in the sight of men, with a holy profession, at least in words" ('Moral.,' 25:26). <span class="cmt_word">This is also vanity</span>. The old refrain recurs to the writer as he thinks on the prosperity of the wicked, and the conclusions which infidels draw therefrom. Here is another example of the vanity that prevails in all earthly circumstances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The verse states one of the results of God's forbearance in punishing the evil. <span class="cmt_word">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily.</span> The verse begins with <span class="accented">asher,"</span> because," as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>, which connects the sentence with the allegation of vanity just preceding, as well as with what follows. <span class="accented">Pithgam</span>, "sentence," "edict," is a foreign word of Persian origin, found in <a href="../../par/esther/1-20.htm">Esther 1:20</a> and in Chaldee portions of Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>) and Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-14.htm">Daniel 4:14</a>, etc.). God seems to us to delay in punishing the guilty because we behold only one little portion of the course of his providence; could we take a more comprehensive view, anomalies would disappear, and we should see the end of these men (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a>). But a contracted, skeptical view leads to two evils - first, a weakening of faith in God's moral government; and second, a miserable fatalism which denies man's responsibility and saps his energy. Of the former of these results Koheleth here treats. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore the heart of the sons of men.</span> The heart is named as the seat of thought and the prime mover of action (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/7-5.htm">Esther 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is fully set in them to do evil</span>; literally, <span class="accented">is full in them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their heart becomes filled with thoughts which are directed to evil, or full of courage, hence "emboldened" (Revised Version margin) to do evil. Vulgate, <span class="accented">absque timore ullo filii hominum perpetrant mala</span>; Septuagint, "Because there is no contradiction (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) made on the part of (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) those who do evil speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully persuaded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>) in them to do evil." The long-suffering of God, instead of leading such men to repentance, hardens them in their infidelity (<a href="../../par/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a>). Primarily, the reference is still to tyrannical despots, who, in their seeming impunity, are em-boldened to pursue their evil course. But the statement is true generally. As Cicero says, "Quis ignorat maximam illecebram esse peccandi impunitatis spem?" ('Pro Milone,' 16.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:12</a></div><div class="verse">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his <i>days</i> be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though a sinner do evil a hundred times</span>. The sentence begins again, as ver. 11, with <span class="accented">asher</span>, followed by a participle; and the conjunction ought to be rendered "because," the statement made in the former verse being resumed and strengthened. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">attamen</span>, which our version follows. The Septuagint goes astray, translating, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "He that has sinned has done evil from that time." The sinner is here supposed to have transgressed continually without cheek or punishment. The expression, "a hundred times," is used indefinitely, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And his days be prolonged</span>; better, <span class="accented">prolongeth his days for it</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the practice of evil, with a kind of contentment and satisfaction, the pronoun being the ethic dative. Contrary to the usual course of temporal retribution, the sinner often lives to old age The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Et per patientiam sustentatur</span>, which signifies that he is kept in life by God's long-suffering. Ginsburg gives, "and is perpetuated," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his progeny - which is a possible, but not a probable, rendering. <span class="cmt_word">Yet surely I know</span>; rather, <span class="accented">though I for my part know</span>. He has seen sinners prosper; this experience has been forced upon him; yet he holds an inward conviction that God's moral government will vindicate itself at some time and in some signal manner. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him.</span> This is not really tautological; it is compared to St. Paul's expression (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3</a>), "widows that are widows indeed" (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), implying that they are, in fact and life, what they profess to be. Delitzsch and Plumptre suggest that in Koheleth's time "God-fearers" had become the name of a religious class, as the <span class="accented">Chasidim</span>, or "Assideaus," in I Macc. 2:42; 7:13, etc. Certainly a trace of this so-named party is seen in <a href="../../par/psalms/118-4.htm">Psalm 118:4</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>. When this adjustment of anomalies shall take place, whether in this life or in another, the writer says not here. In spite of all contrary appearances, he holds firm to his faith that it will be welt with the righteous in the long run. The comfort and peace of a conscience at rest, and the inward feeling that his life was ordered after God's will, would compensate a good man for much outward trouble; and if to this was added the assured hope of another life, it might indeed be said that it was well with him. The Septuagint has, "that they may fear before him," which implies that the mercy and loving-kindness of God, manifested in his care of the righteous, lead to piety and true religion. Cheyne ('Job and Solomon'), combining this verse with the next, produces a sense which is certainly not in the present Hebrew text, "For I know that it ever happens that a sinner does evil for a long time, and yet lives long, whilst he who fears before God is short-lived as a shadow." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:13</a></div><div class="verse">But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong <i>his</i> days, <i>which are</i> as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But it shall not be well with the wicked</span>. If experience seemed often to militate against this assertion, Koheleth's faith prevailed against apparent contradictions. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow.</span> Above we read of a wicked man enjoying a long, untroubled life; here the contrary is stated. Such contradictions are seen every day. There are inscrutable reasons for the delay of judgment; but on the whole moral government is vindicated, and even the long life of a sinner is no blessing. The author of the Book of Wisdom writes (4:8), "Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time, nor that is measured by number of years;" and Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/65-20.htm">Isaiah 65:20</a>), <span class="accented">"The</span> sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed." Man's life is compared to a shadow because it passes away with the setting sun (see on Ecclesiastes 6:12). The Vulgate, in order to obviate the apparent discrepancy between this and the preceding verses, renders the verb in a precatory form: <span class="accented">Non sit bonum impio</span>, etc., "Let it not be well with the wicked, and let his days not be prolonged; but let them pass away as a shadow who fear not the Lord." This is quite unnecessary; and the words, <span class="accented">"as a shadow,"</span> according to the accents, belong to what precedes, as in the Authorized Version. Hitzig and others have adopted the Vulgate division, and render, "Like a shadow is he who fears not God." But there is no sufficient reason for disregarding the existing accentuation. Septuagint, "He shall not prolong his days in a shadow (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fb7;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">Because he feareth not before God</span>. This is the reason, looking to temporal retribution, why the wicked shall not live out half their days (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). Koheleth cleaves to the doctrine received from old time, although facts seem often to contradict it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just <i>men</i>, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked <i>men</i>, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also <i>is</i> vanity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth</span>. The vanity is named in what follows, viz. the seeming injustice it, the distribution of good and evil. <span class="cmt_word">There be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked</span> (comp. ver. 10; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:16</a>). The melancholy fact is noted that the righteous often experience that fate with which the wicked are threatened, which their conduct might be expected to bring upon them. The verb translated "happeneth" (<span class="accented">nags</span>), with <span class="accented">el</span>, "to come to," "strike against," is thus used only in later Hebrew, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/esther/9-26.htm">Esther 9:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">According to the work of the righteous.</span> The wicked meet with that outward prosperity and success which were thought to be the special reward of those who served God. The Vulgate is explanatory, "There are just men whom evils befall as if they did the works of the wicked; and there are wicked men who are as free from care as if they had the deeds of the just." Commenting on <a href="../../par/job/34-10.htm">Job 34:10, 11</a>, St. Gregory writes, "It is by no means always the case in this life that God renders to each man according to his work and according to his own ways. For both many who commit unlawful and wicked deeds he prevents of his free grace, and converts to works of holiness; and some who are devoted to good deeds he reproves by means of the scourge, and so afflicts those who please him, as though they were displeasing to him.... God doubtless so ordains it of his inestimable mercy, that both scourges should torture the just, lest their doings should elate them, and that the unjust should pass this life at least without punishment, because by their evil doings they are hastening onwards to those torments which are without end. For that the just are sometimes scourged in no way according to their deserts is shown by this history of Job. Elihu, therefore, would speak more truly if he had said that there is not unmercifulness and iniquity in God, even when he seems not to render to men according to their ways. For even that which we do not understand is brought forth from the righteous balance of secret judgment" ('Moral.,' 24:44). Koheleth ends by repeating his melancholy refrain, <span class="cmt_word">I said that this also</span> (<span class="accented">indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>is vanity</span>. This conclusion, however, does not lead to despair or infidelity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (<span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I commended mirth</span>. In face of the anomalies which meet us in our view of life, Koheleth recommends the calm enjoyment of such blessings and comforts as we possess, in exact accordance with what has already been said (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>), though the road by which he arrives at the conclusion is <span class="accented">not</span> identical in both cases. In the earlier chapters the injunction is based on man's inability to be the master of his own fate; in the present passage the inscrutable nature of the law that directs God's moral government leads to the advice to make the best of circumstances. In neither instance need we trace veiled Epicureanism. The result obtained is reached by acute observation supplemented by faith in God. <span class="cmt_word">Under the sun.</span> The phrase occurs twice in this verse and again in ver. 17, and implies that the view taken was limited to man's earthly existence. <span class="cmt_word">To eat, and to drink</span>, etc. This is not a commendation of a greedy, voluptuous life, but an injunction thankfully to enjoy the good provided by God without disquieting one's self with the mysteries of Providence. So it was said of Israel in its palmy days (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>), "Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry." <span class="cmt_word">For that shall abide with him of his labor</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and that this should accompany him in his labor</span>. The Greek Version regards the verb as indicative, not subjunctive, nor, as others, as jussive: "This shall attend (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) him in his work." But it seems better to consider Koheleth as saying that the happiest thing for a man is to make the best of what he has, and to take with him in all his work a cheerful and contented heart. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-16.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:16</a></div><div class="verse">When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also <i>there is that</i> neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16</span> - <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a>. - Section 7 (the division in the theme caused by the introduction of a new chapter is misleading). <span class="accented">Man's wisdom is incapable of explaining the course of God's providential government</span>; <span class="accented">death awaits all without any exception, whatever be their condition or actions</span>.

The answering member of the sentence is in ver. 17, the last clause of the present verse being parenthetical. <span class="cmt_word">To know wisdom</span>. This was his first study (see on Ecclesiastes 1:16). He endeavored to acquire wisdom which might enable him to investigate God's doings. His second study was <span class="cmt_word">to see the business that is done upon the earth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only to learn what men do in their several stations and callings, but likewise to understand what all this means, what it tends to, its object and result. (For "business," <span class="accented">inyan</span>, see on Ecclesiastes 1:13.) The Vulgate here renders it <span class="accented">distentionem</span>, "distraction," which is like the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For also</span> there is that <span class="cmt_word">neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes</span>. This is a parenthetical clause expressing either the restless, unrelieved labor that goes on in the world, or the sleepless meditation of one who tries to solve the problem of the order and disorder in men's lives. In the latter case, Koheleth may be giving his own experience. To "see sleep" is to enjoy sleep. The phrase is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, but commentators quote parallels from classical sources. Thus Terence, 'Heautontim.,' 3:1.82 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Somnum hercle ego hac nocte cculis non vidi reels."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No sleep mine eyes have seen this livelong night."</span> Cicero, 'Ad Famil.,' 8:30, "Fuit mittflea vigilantia, qui tote sue consulatuson, hum non vidit." Of course, the expression is hyperbolical. The same idea is found without metaphor in such passages as <a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-4.htm">Proverbs 6:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek <i>it</i> out, yet he shall not find <i>it</i>; yea further; though a wise <i>man</i> think to know <i>it</i>, yet shall he not be able to find <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I beheld all the work of God</span>.

The two verses, with their repetitions and tautologous expressions, seem to denote perturbation of mind in the author and his sense of the gravity of his assertions. He is overwhelmed with the thought of the inscrutability of God's judgments, while he is forced to face the facts. An exquisite commentary on this passage is found in Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 1:2. &sect; 2, quoted by Plumptre; and in Bishop Butler's sermon 'On the Ignorance of Man,' where we read, "From it [the knowledge of our ignorance] we may learn with what temper of mind a man ought to inquire into the subject of religion, namely, with what expectation of finding difficulties, and with a disposition to take up and rest satisfied with any evidence whatever which is real. A man should beforehand expect things mysterious, and such as he will not be able thoroughly to comprehend or go to the bottom of.... Our ignorance is the proper answer to many things which are called objections  against religion, particularly to those which arise from the appearance of evil and irregularity in the constitution of nature and the government of the world Since the constitution of nature and the methods and designs of Providence in the government of the world are above our comprehension, we should acquiesce in and rest satisfied with our ignorance, turn our thoughts from that which is above and beyond us, and apply ourselves to that which is level to our capacities, and which is our real business and concern .... Lastly, let us adore that infinite wisdom and power and goodness which is above our comprehension (Ecclus. 1:6). The conclusion is that in all lowliness of mind we set lightly by ourselves; that we form our temper to an implicit submission to the Divine Majesty, beget within ourselves an absolute resignation to all the methods of his providence in his dealings with the children of men; that in the deepest humility of our souls we prostrate ourselves before him, and join in that celestial song, 'Great and marvelous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.

literally, <span class="accented">for</span> <span class="accented">all this laid up in my heart, and all this I have been about</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">I sought</span>) <span class="accented">to clear up</span>. The reference is both to what has been said and to what is coming. The <span class="accented">ki</span>, "for" (which the Vulgate omits), at the beginning gives the reason for the truth of what is advanced; the writer has omitted no means of arriving at a conclusion. One great result of his consideration he proceeds to state. The Septuagint connects this clause closely with the last verse of the preceding chapter, "For I applied all this to my heart, and my heart saw all this." The righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God (<a href="../../par/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his power, under his direction. Man is not independent. Even the good and wise, who might be supposed to afford the plainest evidence of the favorable side of God's moral government, are subject to the same unsearchable law. The very incomprehensibility of this principle proves that it comes from God, and men may well be content to submit themselves to it, knowing that he is as just as he is almighty. <span class="cmt_word">No man knoweth either love or hatred.</span> God's favor or displeasure are meant. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et tamen nescit homo, utrum amore an odio dignus sit</span>. We cannot judge from the events that befall a man what is the view which God takes of his character. We must not, like Job's friends, decide that a man is a great sinner because calamity falls upon him, nor again suppose that outward prosperity is a proof of a life righteous and well-pleasing to God. Outward circumstances are no criterion of inward disposition or of final judgment. From the troubles or the comforts which we ourselves experience or witness in others we have no right to argue God's favor or displeasure. He disposes matters as seems best to him, and we must not expect to see every one in this world treated according to what we should deem his deserts (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32</a> with <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). Delitzsch and others think that the expressions "love" and "hatred" are too general to admit of being interpreted as above, and they determine the sense to be that no one can tell beforehand who will be the objects of, his love or hate, or how entirely his feelings may change in regard of persons with whom he is brought in contact. The circumstances which give rise to these sentiments are entirely beyond his control and foresight. This is true enough, but it does not seem to me to be intended. The author is concerned, not with inward sentiments, but with prosperity and adversity considered popularly as indications of God's view of things. It would be but a meager assertion to state that you cannot know whether you are to love or hate, because God ordains all such contingencies; whereas to warn against hasty and infidel judgments on the ground of our ignorance of God's mysterious ways, is sound and weighty advice, and in due harmony with what follows in the next verses. The interpretation, "No man knows whether he shall meet with the love or hatred of his fellows," has commended itself to some critics, but is as inadmissible as the one just mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">By all that is before them.</span> The Hebrew is simply, "all [lies] before them." All that shall happen, all that shall shape their destiny in the future, is obscure and unknown, and beyond their control. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The Vulgate mixes this clause with the following verse, <span class="accented">But all things are kept uncertain for the future</span>. St. Gregory, "As thou knowest not who are converted from sin to goodness, nor who turn back from goodness to sin; so also thou dost not understand what is doing towards thyself as thy merits deserve. And as thou dost not at all comprehend another's end, so art thou also unable to foresee thine own. For thou knowest now what progress thou hast made thyself, but what I [-God] still think of thee in secret thou knowest not. Thou now thinkest on thy deeds of righteousness; but thou knowest not how strictly they are weighed by me. Woe even to the praiseworthy life of men if it be judged without mercy, because when strictly examined it is overwhelmed in the presence of the Judge by the very conduct with which it imagines that it pleases him" ('Moral.,' 29:34, Oxford transl.).

There is no difference in the treatment of persons; all people of every kind meet with circumstances of every kind. Speaking generally, there is no discrimination, apparently, in the distribution of good and evil. Sun and shade, calm and storm. fruitful and unfruitful seasons, joy and sorrow, are dispensed by inscrutable laws. The Septuagint, reading differently, has, "Vanity is in all;" the Syriac unites two readings, "All before him is vanity, all as to all" (Ginsburg). <span class="cmt_word">There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</span> All men have the same lot, whether it be death or any other contingency, without regard to their naomi condition. The classes into which men are divided must be noted. "Righteous" and <span class="accented">"wicked"</span> refer to men in their conduct to others. <span class="cmt_word">The good.</span> The Septuagint, Vulgate, and Syriac add, "to the evil," which is said again almost immediately. <span class="cmt_word">To the clean, and to the unclean</span>. "The good" and "clean" are those who are not only ceremonially pure, but, as the epithet "good" shows, are morally undefiled. <span class="cmt_word">To him that sacrificeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the man who attends to the externals of religion, offers the obligatory sacrifices, and brings his free-will offerings. <span class="cmt_word">The good...  the sinner</span>; in the widest senses. <span class="cmt_word">He that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath</span>. He who takes an oath lightly, carelessly, or falsely (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/5-3.htm">Zechariah 5:3</a>), is contrasted with him who regards it as a holy thing, or shrinks in awe from invoking God's Name in such a case This last idea is regarded as a late Essenic development (see Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:08. 6); though something like it is found in the sermon on the mount, "I say unto you, Swear not at all," etc. (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34-37</a>). Dean Plumptre, however, throws doubt on the above interpretation, owing to the fact that in all the other groups the good side is placed first; and he suggests that "he who sweareth" may be one who does his duty in this particular religiously and well (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-16.htm">Isaiah 65:16</a>), and "he who fears the oath" is a man whose conscience makes him shrink from the oath of compurgation (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-22</a>), or who is too cowardly to give his testimony in due form. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">Ut perjurus, its et ille qui verum dejerat</span>; and it seems unnecessary to present an entirely new view of the passage in slavish expectation of a concinnity which the author cannot be proved to have ever aimed at. The five contrasted pairs are the righteous and the wicked, the clean and the unclean, the sacrificer and the non-sacrificer, the good and the sinner, the profane swearer and the man who reverences an oath. The last clause is rendered by the Septuagint, "So is he who sweareth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) even as he who fears the oath," which is as ambiguous as the original.

The "evil" is explained in the following words, which speak of the common fate. The Vulgate (followed by Ginsburg and others) lakes the first words as equivalent to a superlative: <span class="accented">Hoc est pessimum inter omnia</span>, "This is the greatest evil of all that is done under the sun." But the article would have been used in this case; nor would this accurately express Koheleth's sentiments. He looks upon death only as one of the evils appertaining to men's career on earth - one of the phases of that identity of treatment so certain and so inexplicable, which leads to disastrous results (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That there is one event unto all</span>. The "one event," as the end of the verse shows, is death. We have here the old strain repeated which is found in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:12</a>; "Omnes eodem cogimur" (Horace, 'Carm.,' 2:3. 25). <span class="cmt_word">Yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil.</span> In consequence of this indiscriminating destiny men sin recklessly, are encouraged in their wickedness. <span class="cmt_word">Madness is in their heart while they live.</span> The "madness" is conduct opposed to the dictates of wisdom and reason, as <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:2, 12</a>. All their life long men follow their own lusts and passions, and care little for God's will and law, or their own best interests. This is well called "want of reason (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, Septuagint). <span class="cmt_word">And after that they go to the dead.</span> The verb is omitted in the Hebrew, being implied by the preposition XXX, "to;" the omission is very forcible. Delitzsch, Wright, and others render, "after him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> after man's life is ended, which seems rather to say, "after they die, they die." The idea, however, appears to be, both good and evil go to the same place, pass away into nothingness, are known no more in this world. Here at present Koheleth leaves the question of the future life, having already intimated his belief in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. and Ecclesiastes 8:11, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope</span>. As long as a man lives (is one of living beings) he has some hope, whatever it be.

No being exists, of hope,<br />Of love, void."</span> This clause gives a reason for the folly of men, mentioned in ver. 3. Whatever be their lot, or their way of life, they see no reason to make any change by reformation or active exertion. They go on hoping, and do nothing. Something may turn up; amid the inexplicable confusion of the ordering of events some happy contingency may arrive. The above is the reading according to the Keri. Thus the Septuagint:  <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>; "For who is he that has fellowship with all the living?" Symmachus has, "For who is he that will always continue to live?" while the Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Nemo</span> <span class="accented">est qui semper vivat</span>. The Khetib points differently, offering the reading, "For who is excepted?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the common lot, the interrogation being closely connected with the preceding verse, or "Who can choose?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether he will die or not. The sentence then proceeds, "To all the living there is hope." But the rendering of the Authorized Version has good authority, and affords the better sense. <span class="cmt_word">For a living dog is better than a dead lion</span>. The dog in Palestine was not made a pet and companion, as it is among us, but was regarded as a loathsome and despicable object comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-43.htm">1 Samuel 17:43</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>); while the lion was considered as the noblest of beasts, the type of power and greatness (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-30.htm">Proverbs 30:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/31-4.htm">Isaiah 31:4</a>). So the proverbial saying in the text means that the vilest and meanest creature possessed of life is better than the highest and mightiest which has succumbed to death. There is an apparent contradiction between this sentence and such passages as claim a preference for death over life, e.g. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/4-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>; but in the latter the writer is viewing life with all its sorrows and bitter experiences, here he regards it as affording the possibility of enjoyment. In the one case he holds death as desirable, because it delivers from further sorrow and puts an end to misery; in the other, he deprecates death as cutting off from pleasure and hope. He may also have in mind that now is the time to do the work which we have to perform: "The night cometh when no man can work;" Ecclus. 17:28, "Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not; the living and sound shall praise the Lord" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-18.htm">Isaiah 38:18, 19</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the living know that they shall die</span>. This is added in confirmation of the statement in ver. 4. The living have at least the consciousness that they will soon have to die, and this leads them to work while it is day, to employ their faculties worthily, to make use of opportunities, to enjoy and profit by the present. They have a certain fixed event to which they must look forward; and they have not to stand idle, lamenting their fate, but their duty and their happiness is to accept the inevitable and make the best of it. <span class="cmt_word">But the dead know not anything</span>. They are cut off from the active, bustling world; their work is done; they have nothing to expect, nothing to labor for. What passes upon earth affects them not; the knowledge of it reaches them no longer. Aristotle's idea was that the dead did know something, in a hazy and indistinct way, of what went on in the upper world, and were in some slight degree influenced thereby, but not to such a degree as to change happiness into misery, or <span class="accented">vice versa</span> ('Eth. Nicom.,' 1:10 and 11). <span class="cmt_word">Neither have they any more a reward</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> no fruit for labor done. There is no question here about future retribution in another world. The gloomy view of the writer at this moment precludes all idea of such an adjustment of anomalies after death. <span class="cmt_word">For the memory of them is forgotten.</span> They have not even the poor reward of being remembered by loving posterity, which in the mind of an Oriental was an eminent blessing, to be much desired. There is a paronomasia in <span class="accented">zeker</span>, "memory," and <span class="accented">sakar</span>, "reward," which, as Plumptre suggests, may be approximately represented in English by the words "record" and "reward." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any <i>thing</i> that is done under the sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now</span> (<span class="accented">long ago</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>perished</span>. All the feelings which are exhibited and developed in the life of the upper world are annihilated (comp. ver. 10). Three are selected as the most potent passions, such as by their strength and activity might ideally be supposed to survive even the stroke of death. But all are now at an end. <span class="cmt_word">Neither have they any more a portion forever in any thing that is done under the sun.</span> Between the dead and the living an impassable gulf exists. The view of death here given, intensely gloomy and hopeless as it appears to be, is in conformity with other passages of the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/job/14-10.htm">Job 14:10-14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/6-5.htm">Psalm 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/30-9.htm">Psalm 30:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-10.htm">Isaiah 38:10-19</a>; Ecclus. 17:27, 28; Bar. 3:16-19), and that imperfect dispensation. Koheleth and his contemporaries were of those "who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-15.htm">Hebrews 2:15</a>); it was Christ who brightened the dark valley, showing the blessedness of those who die in the Lord, bringing life and immortality to light through the gospel (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>). Some expositors have felt the pessimistic utterances of this passage so deeply that they have endeavored to account for them by introducing an atheistic objector, or an intended opposition between flesh and spirit. But there is not a trace of any two such voices, and the suggestion is quite unnecessary. The writer, while believing in the continued existence of the soul, knows little and has little that is cheering to say about it's condition; and what he does say is not inconsistent with a judgment to come, though he has not yet arrived at the enunciation of this great solution. The Vulgate renders the last clause, <span class="accented">Nec habent partem in hoc saeculo et in opere quod sub sole geritur</span>. But "forever" is the correct rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, and Ginsburg concludes that Jerome's translation can be traced to the Hagadistic interpretation of the verse which restricts its scope to the wicked The author of the Book of Wisdom, writing later, takes a much more hopeful view of death and the departed (see <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/1-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-22.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:22-24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>; 6:18; 8:17; 15:3, etc.).

The inscrutability of the moral government of the world, the uncertainty of life, the condition of the dead, lead to the conclusion again that one should use one's life to the best advantage; and Koheleth repeats his caution concerning the issues and duration of life.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy</span>. This is not an injunction to lead a selfish life of Epicurean pleasure; but taking the limited view to which he here confines himself, the Preacher inculcates the practical wisdom of looking at the bright side of things; he says in effect (though he takes care afterwards to correct a wrong impression which might be given)," Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>). We have had the same counsel in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Drink thy wine with a merry heart</span>. Wine was not an accompaniment of meals usually; it -was reserved for feasts and solemn occasions. Bread and wine are here regarded as the necessary means of support and comfort (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/10-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>, etc.). The moderate use of wine is nowhere forbidden; there is no law in the Old Testament against the use of intoxicating drinks; the employment of such fluids as cordials, exhilarating, strengthening and comforting, is often referred to (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/9-13.htm">Judges 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6, 7</a>; Ecclus. 31:27, 28). Thus Koheleth's advice, taken even literally, is not contrary to the spirit of his religion. <span class="cmt_word">For God now</span> (<span class="accented">long ago</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>accepteth thy works</span>. The "works" are not moral or religious doings, in reward of which God gives temporal blessings, which is plainly opposed to Koheleth's chief contention in all this passage. The works are the eating and drinking just mentioned. By the constitution of man's nature, and by the ordering of Providence, such capacity of enjoyment is allowable, and there need be no scruple in using it. Such things are God's good gifts, and to be received with reverence and thanksgiving; and he who thus employs them is well-pleasing unto the Lord (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-24.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/8-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let thy garments be always white</span>. The Preacher brings into prominence certain particulars of enjoyment, more noticeable than mere eating and drinking. White garments in the East (as among ourselves) were symbols of joy and purity. Thus the singers in Solomon's temple were arrayed in white linen (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-12.htm">2 Chronicles 5:12</a>). Mordecai was thus honored by King Ahasuerus (<a href="../../par/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>), the angels are seen similarly decked (<a href="../../par/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>), and the glorified saints are clothed in white (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>). So in the pseudepi-graphal books the same imagery is retained. Those that "have fulfilled the Law of the Lord have received glorious garments, and are clothed in white" (2 Esdr. 2:39, 40). Among the Romans the same symbolism obtained. Horace ('Sat.,' 2:2. 60) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Ille repotia, natales aliosve dierum<br />Festes albatus celebret."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Though he in whitened toga celebrate<br />His wedding, birthday, or high festival."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Let thy head lack no ointment</span>. Oil and perfumes were used on festive occasions not only among Eastern nations, but by Greeks and Romans (see on Ecclesiastes 7:1). Thus Telemachus is anointed with fragrant oil by the fair Polykaste (Homer, 'Od,' 3:466). Sappho complains to Phaen (Ovid,' Heroid.' 15:76) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Non Arabs noster rore capillus olet."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"No myrrh of Araby bedews my hair."</span> Such allusions in Horace are frequent and commonly cited (see 'Carm.,' 1:5. 2; 2:7. 7, 8; 2:11. 15, etc.). Thus the double injunction in this verse counsels one to be always happy and cheerful. Gregory Thaumaturgus (cited by Plumptre) represents the passage as the error of "men of vanity;" and other commentators have deemed that it conveyed not the Preacher's own sentiments, but those of an atheist whom he cites. There is, as we have already seen, no need to resort to such an explanation. Doubtless the advice may readily be perverted to evil, and made to sanction sensuality and licentiousness, as-we see to have been done in Wisd. 2:6-9; but Koheleth only urges the moderate use of earthly goods as consecrated by God's gift. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that <i>is</i> thy portion in <i>this</i> life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest</span>; literally, see <span class="accented">life with a wife whom thou lovest</span>. The article is omitted, as the maxim is to be taken generally. In correction of the outspoken condemnation of women in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>, Koheleth here recognizes the happiness of a home where is found a helpmate beloved and worthy of love (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-22.htm">Proverbs 17:22</a>, on which our passage seems to be founded; and Ecclus. 26:13-18). (For the expression, " see life," <span class="accented">vide</span> note on Ecclesiastes 2:1.) St. Jerome's comment is misleading, "Quacumque tibi placuerit feminarum ejus gaude complexu." Some critics translate <span class="accented">ishshah</span> here "woman." Thus Cox: "Enjoy thyself with any woman whom thou lovest;" but the best commentators agree that the married state is meant in the text, not mere sensual enjoyment. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of the life of thy vanity</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> throughout the time of thy quickly passing life. This is repeated after the next clause (though there omitted by the Septuagint and Syriac), in order to emphasize the transitoriness of the present and the consequent wisdom of enjoying it while it lasts. So Horace bids man "carpe diem" ('Carm.,' 1:11.8), "enjoy each atom of the day;'" and Martial sings ('Epigr,' 7:47. 11) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Vive velut rapto fugitivaque gaudia carpe."</span><br /><span class="accented">"Live thou thy life as stolen, and enjoy<br />Thy quickly fading pleasures."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Which he</span> (<span class="accented">God</span>) <span class="cmt_word">hath given thee under the sun</span>. The relative may refer to either the "wife" or" the days of life." The Septuagint and Vulgate take it as belonging to the latter, and this seems most suitable (comp. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That is thy portion in this life, and in thy labor</span>, etc. Such moderate enjoyment is the recompense allowed by God for the toil which accompanies a properly spent life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do <i>it</i> with thy might; for <i>there is</i> no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might</span>. In accordance with what has been already said, and to combat the idea that, as man cannot control his fate, he should take no pains to work his work, but fold his hands in resigned inaction, Koheleth urges him not to despair, but to do his part manfully as long as life is given, and with all the energies of his soul carry out the purpose of his being. The Septuagint gives, <span class="accented">"All</span> things whatsoever thy hand shall find to do, do it as thy power is (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quodcumque facere potest manus tua, instanter operate</span>. The expression at the commencement may be illustrated by <a href="../../par/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-28.htm">Leviticus 25:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-33.htm">Judges 9:33</a>, where it implies ability to carry out some intention, and in some passages is thus rendered, "is able," etc. (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>). It is therefore erroneous to render it in this place, "Whatever by chance cometh to hand;" <span class="accented">or</span> "Let might be right." Rather it is a call to work as the prelude and accompaniment of enjoyment, anticipating St. Paul's maxim (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>), <span class="accented">"If</span> any would not work, neither should he eat." Ginsburg's interpretation is dishonoring to the Preacher and foreign to his real sentiments, "Have recourse to every source of voluptuous gratification, while thou art in thy <span class="accented">strength</span>." The true meaning of the verse is confirmed by such references as <a href="../../par/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>, <span class="accented">"I</span> must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>, "Now is the accepted time; now is the day of salvation;" <a href="../../par/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>, "As we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men." <span class="cmt_word">For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave.</span> The departed have no more work which they can do, no plans or calculations to make; their knowledge is strictly limited, their wisdom is ended. It needs body and soul to carry on the labors and activities of this world; when these are severed, and can no longer act together, there is a complete alteration in the man's relations and capacities. <span class="accented">"The</span> grave," <span class="accented">sheol</span> (which is found nowhere else in <span class="accented">Ecclesiastes</span>)<span class="accented">, is</span> the place to which go the souls of the dead - a shadowy region. <span class="cmt_word">Whither thou goest; to which all are bound</span>. It is plain that the writer believes in the continued existence of the soul, as he differentiates its life in <span class="accented">sheol</span> from its life on earth, the energies and operations which are carried on in the one case being curtailed or eclipsed in the other. Of any repentance, or purification, or progress, in the unseen world, Koheleth knows and says nothing. He would seem to regard existence there as a sleep or a state of insensibility; at any rate, such is the natural view of the present passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:11</a></div><div class="verse">I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race <i>is</i> not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - Section 8. <span class="accented">It is impossible to calculate upon the issues and duration of life</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - He reverts to the sentiment of ver. 1, that we cannot calculate on the issues of life. Work as we may and must and ought, the results are uncertain and beyond our control. This he shows by his own personal experience. <span class="cmt_word">I returned, and saw under the sun.</span> The expression here does not indicate a new departure, but merely a repetition and confirmation of a previous thought - the dependence and conditionality of man. It implies, too, a correction of a possible misunderstanding of the injunction to labor, as if one's own efforts were sure to secure success. <span class="cmt_word">The race is not to the swift.</span> One is reminded of the fable of the hare and tortoise; but Koheleth's meaning is different. In the instances given he intimates that, though a man is well equipped for his work and uses all possible exertions, he may incur failure. So one may be a fleet runner, and yet, owing to some untoward accident or disturbing circumstance, not come in first. Thus Ahimaaz brought to David tidings of Absalom's defeat before Cushi, who had had the start of him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27, 31</a>). There is no occasion to invent an allusion to the foot-race in the formal Greek games. <span class="cmt_word">The battle to the strong.</span> Victory does not always accrue to mighty men, heroes. As David, himself an instance of the truth of the maxim, says (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), "The Lord saveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither yet bread to the wise</span>. Wisdom will not ensure competency. To do this requires other endowments. Many a man of cultivated intellect and of high mental power is left to starve. <span class="cmt_word">Riches to men of understanding</span>. Aristophanes accounts for the unequal distribution of wealth thus ('Plutus,' 88), the god himself speaking- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"I threatened, when a boy,<br />On none but just and wise and orderly<br />My favors to bestow; so Zeus in jealousy<br />Hath made me blind, that I may none of these Distinguish."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet favor to men of skill</span>. "Skill" here does not mean dexterity in handicrafts or arts, but knowledge generally; and the gnome says that reputation and influence do not necessarily accompany the possession of knowledge and learning; knowledge is not a certain or indispensable means to favor. Says the Greek gnomist - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not prudence rules, but fortune, men's affairs."</span> That time and chance happeneth to them all.

Everything has its proper season appointed by God, and man is powerless to control these arrangements. Our English word "chance" conveys an erroneous impression. What is meant is rather "incident," such as a calamity, disappointment, unforeseen occurrence. All human purposes are liable to be changed or controlled by circumstances beyond man's power, and incapable of explanation. A hand higher than man's disposes events, and success is conditioned by superior laws which work unexpected results.

Not only are results out of man's control (ver. 11), but his life is in higher hands, and he is never sure of a day. <span class="cmt_word">As the fishes that are taken in an evil net</span>, etc. The suddenness and unforeseen nature of calamities that befall men are here expressed by two forcible similes (comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-23.htm">Proverbs 7:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3</a>).

To my mind it appeared an important example (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>). Some critics who contend for the Solomonic authorship of our book, see here an allegorical reference to the foreseen revolt of Jeroboam, whose insurrection had been opposed by certain wise statesmen, but had been carried out in opposition to their counsel. Wordsworth considers that the apologue may be illustrated by the history of Jerusalem, when great powers were arrayed against it in the time of Isaiah, and the prophet by his prayers and exhortations delivered it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-2.htm">2 Kings 19:2, 6, 20</a>), but was wholly disregarded afterwards, nay, was put to death by the son of the king whom he saved.

The substantive verb is, as commonly, omitted. Commentators have amused themselves with endeavoring to identify the city here mentioned.

The Septuagint takes the whole paragraph hypothetically, "Suppose there was a little city," etc. Wright well compares the historical allusions to events fresh in the minds of his hearers made by our Lord in his parable of the pounds (<a href="../../par/luke/19-12.htm">Luke 19:12, 14, 15, 27</a>). So we may regard the present section as a parable founded on some historical fact well known at the time when the book was written. <span class="cmt_word">A great king</span>. The term points to some Persian or Assyrian potentate; or it may mean merely a powerful general (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/job/29-25.htm">Job 29:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Built great bulwarks against it</span>.

What are meant are embankments or mounds raised high enough to overtop the walls of the town, and to command the positions of the besieged. For the same purpose wooden towers were also used (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32</a>; Jeremiah lit. 4).

Or we may continue the subject of the preceding verse and consider the king as spoken of: "He came across, met with unexpectedly, a poor man who was wise." So the Septuagint. The word for <span class="accented">"poor"</span> in this passage is <span class="accented">misken</span>, for which see note on Ecclesiastes 4:13. <span class="cmt_word">He by his wisdom delivered the city</span>. When the besieged city had neither soldiers nor arms to defend itself against its mighty enemies, the man of poor estate, hitherto unknown or little regarded, came forward, and by wise counsel relieved his countrymen from their perilous situation. How this was done we are left to conjecture. It may have been by some timely concessions or negotiations; or by the surrender of a chief offender as at Abel-Beth-maachah; or by the assassination of a general, as at Bethulia (Jud. 13:8); or by the clever application of mechanical arts, as at Syracuse, under the direction of Archimedes (Livy, 24:34; Plutarch, 'Marcell.,' 15-18.). Yet no man remembered that same poor man. As soon as the exigence which brought him forward was past, the poor man fell back into his insignificance, and was thought of no more; he gained no personal advantage, by his wisdom; his ungrateful countrymen forgot his very existence. Thus Joseph was treated by the chief butler (<a href="../../par/genesis/40-23.htm">Genesis 40:23</a>). Classical readers will think of Coriolanus, Scipio Africanus, Themistocles, Miltiades, who for their services to the state were rewarded with calumny, false accusation, obloquy, and banishment. The author of the Book of Wisdom gives a different and ideal experience. "I," he says, "for the sake of wisdom shall have estimation among the multitude, and honor with the elders, though I be young.... By the means of her I shall obtain immortality, and leave behind me an everlasting memorial" (Wisd. 8:10-13).

There is an interpolation in the Old Latin Version of Wisd. 6. I which seems to have been compiled from this passage and <a href="../../par/proverbs/16-13.htm">Proverbs 16:13</a>, "Melter est sapientia quam vires, et vir prudens quam fortis." <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless the poor man's wisdom is despised,</span> etc. In the instance above mentioned the poor man's wisdom was not despised and his words were heard and attended to; but this was an abnormal case, occasioned by the extremity of the peril. Koheleth states the result which usually attends wisdom emanating from a disesteemed source. The experience of Ben-Sire pointed to the same issue (see Ecclus. 13:22, 23). Horace, 'Epist.,' 1:1.57 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Est animus tibi, sunt mores et lingua fidesque,<br />Sed quadringentis sex septem millia desunt;<br />Plebs erie."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"In wit, worth, honor, one in vain abounds;<br />If of the knight's estate he lack ten pounds,<br />He's low, quite low!"</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Howes.</span>) Is not this the carpenter's Son? asked the people who were offended at Christ (<a href="../../par/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2, 3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-17.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">The words of wise <i>men are</i> heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - Section 10. Here follow <span class="accented">some proverbial sayings concerning wisdom and its opposite</span>, which draw the moral from the story in the text. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools</span>. This verse would be better translated, Wo<span class="accented">rds of the wise in quiet are heard better than the shout of a chief among fools</span>. The Vulgate takes the tranquility to appertain to the hearers, thus: <span class="accented">Verbs sapientium audiuntur in silentio</span>; but, as Delitzsch points out, the contrast between "quiet" and "cry" shows that it is the man, and not his auditors, who is quiet. The sentence says that a wise man's words, uttered calmly, deliberately, without pompous declamation or adventitious aids, are of more value than the blustering vociferation of an arch-fool, who seeks to force acceptance for his folly by loudness and swagger (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>; and see <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-2.htm">Isaiah 42:2</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/12-19.htm">Matthew 12:19</a>, passages which speak of the peacefulness, reticence, and unobtrusiveness of true wisdom, as seen in the Son of God). The verse introduces a kind of exception to the general rejection of wisdom mentioned above. Though the multitude turn a deaf ear to a wise man's counsel, yet this tells in the long run, and there are always some teachable persons-who sit at his feet and learn from him. "He that ruleth among fools" is not one that governs a silly people, but one who is a prince of fools, who takes the highest place among such. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">Wisdom <i>is</i> better than weapons of war: but one sinner destroyeth much good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom is better than weapons of war</span>. Such is the moral which Koheleth desires to draw from the little narrative given above (see vers. 14-16; and <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:19</a>). Wisdom can do what no material force can effect, and often produces results which all the implements of war could not command. <span class="cmt_word">But one sinner destroyeth much good.</span> The happy consequences which the wise man's counsel might accomplish, or has already accomplished, may be overthrown or rendered useless by the villany or perversity of a bad man. The Vulgate, reading differently, has, <span class="accented">Qui in uno peccaverit, multa bona perdet</span>. But this seems to be out of keeping with the context. Adam's sin infected the whole race of man; Achau's transgression caused Israel's defeat (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11, 12</a>); Rehoboam's folly occasioned the great schism (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>). The wide&deg; reaching effects of one little error are illustrated by the proverbial saying which every one knows, and which runs in Latin thus: "Clavus unus perdit equi soleam, soles equum, equus equitem, eques castra, castro rempublicam." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ecclesiastes/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ecclesiastes/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ecclesiastes 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ecclesiastes 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
