Nothing more is known of Tola than what is here told us, viz., his name, his parentage, his dwelling-place, his office, the length of time which he held it, and the place of his burial. Who were the enemies from whom Tola was raised up to save Israel we are not told. There was probably no great invasion or grievous servitude, but perhaps frequent border wars requiring an able and watchful chief to maintain the independence of Israel. Tola and Puah (otherwise written Puvah) were both names of families in Issachar (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-13.htm">Genesis 46:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-23.htm">Numbers 26:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shamir in mount Ephraim</span>, to distinguish it from <span class="accented">Shamir in</span> the hill country of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48</a>).

We read of Jair the son of Segub, the son of Machir's daughter by Hezron, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>, and are there told that he had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead (called Havoth-jair), which were included in the territory of the sons of Machir. The same information is given in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-40.htm">Numbers 32:40-42</a>, and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14, 15</a>, in both which passages Jair is styled the son of Manasseh, and is stated to have called the cities after his own name, Havoth-jair. In the present verse we are also told that Jair the judge was a Gileadite, and that he had thirty sons who had thirty cities in Gilead called Havoth-jair. The question arises, Can these two be the same person? If they are, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> must be a later parenthetical insertion, as it has very much the appearance of being. The notice in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a> must also refer to later times than those of Moses, and we must understand the statement in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, that "Segub begat Jair," as meaning that he was his lineal ancestor, just as in <a href="../../par/matthew/1-8.htm">Matthew 1:8</a> we read that "Joram begat Ozias," though three generations intervened between them. If, on the other hand, they are not the same, we must suppose that Jair in our text was a descendant of the other Jair, and may compare the double explanation of the name Havoth-jair with the double explanation of <span class="accented">Beer-sheba</span> given <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-31.htm">Genesis 26:31-33</a>; the threefold explanation of the name Isaac, <a href="../../par/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/21-6.htm">Genesis 21:6</a>; and the double explanation of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" given in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>. The Hebrew name <span class="accented">Jair</span> is preserved in the New Testament under the Greek form of <span class="accented">Jairus</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22</a>).

The number and dignity of these knightly sons of Jair shows that Jair himself, like Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>), assumed the state of a prince. The word in Hebrew for ass <span class="accented">colts is</span> identical with that for <span class="accented">cities</span>, as here pointed, and this play upon the words belongs to the same turn of mind as produced Jotham s fable and Samson's riddle (<a href="../../par/judges/14-14.htm">Judges 14:14</a>).

A city of Gilead according to Josephus, and probability. Polybius mentions a <span class="accented">Camoun</span> among other trans-Jordanic places, but its site has not been verified by modern research. Eusebius and Jerome place it in the plain of Esdraelon, but without probability. The careful mention of the place of sepulture of the judges and kings is remarkable, beginning with Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/8-32.htm">Judges 8:32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-2.htm">Judges 10:2, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-9.htm">Judges 12:9, 10, 12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/16-31.htm">Judges 16:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:6-18

We may conclude that Tola and Jair had used their influence to maintain the worship of Jehovah; but at their death idolatry broke out with more virulence than ever. Not only were the many altars of Baal and Ashtoreth honoured, as in former times, but new forms of idol-worship, according to the rites of all the neighbouring nations, were introduced among them. The gods of Syria, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Aram, who are not usually named, but whose worship is spoken of (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>), and whose altar attracted the attention of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10</a>), and one of whom was Rimmon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/5-18.htm">2 Kings 5:18</a>); the gods of the Zidonians, Baal and Ashtoreth, probably with rites somewhat differing from those of Canaan; Chemosh, the god of the Moabites; Milcom or Moloch, the god of the children of Ammon; and Dagon, the god of the Philis-tines - all were worshipped, while the service of Jehovah was thrust aside (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5-7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The anger of the Lord</span>, etc. See <a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Into the hands of the Philistines</span>. Probably the same Philistine domination as is described more fully in the history of the judgeship of Samson (chs. 13-16.). But now the writer confines his attention first to the oppression of the Ammonites.

It does not appear clearly what particular year is meant. Jarchi explains it as the year in which air died.

But in its narrower and stricter sense Gilead was bounded on the north by Bashan proper, and on the south by the <span class="accented">Mishor</span>, or plain of Medeba, which lay between the valley of Heshbon and the river Arnon, thus excluding that part of the territory of Reuben from Gilead (see <a href="../../par/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9-11</a>). Originally, as we learn from <a href="../../par/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13-22</a>, the territory bounded by the Arnon on the south, by the Jabbok on the north, by the wilderness on the east, and by the Jordan on the west, had belonged to Moab, but the Amorites had taken it from them before the conquest of Sihon by the Israelites.

If we may trust the king of the Ammonites' statement, the object of the war was to recover that land, and he carried the war across the Jordan into the territory of Judah and Ephraim in order to compel the Israelites to give it up.

They show the existence of a real history in the background of that which has been preserved in the Bible (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">From the Egyptians</span>, as related at large in the Book of Exodus; <span class="cmt_word">from the Amorites</span>, as related in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>; <span class="cmt_word">from the children of Ammon</span>, who were confederate with the Moabites under Ehud, as we learn from <a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>; from the Philistines, as is briefly recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>.

This allusion is not clear; it may mean the subjects of Jabin king of Canaan, as the northern Canaanites are called <span class="accented">Zidonians</span> in ch. 18:7; and this agrees with the order in which the deliverance from the Zidonians is here mentioned, next to that from the Philistines, and would be strengthened by the conjecture that has been made, that Harosheth (<a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>) was the great workshop in which the tributary Israelites wrought in cutting down timber, etc. for the Phoenician ships; or it may allude to some unrecorded oppression. <span class="cmt_word">The Amalekites</span>, who were in alliance with the Midianites (<a href="../../par/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3, 33</a>), as previously with the Moabites (<a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>) and with the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>), and whose signal defeat seems to have given the name to the mount of the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/judges/12-15.htm">Judges 12:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Maonites</span>.

If <span class="accented">Maonites</span> or <span class="accented">Maon</span> is the true reading, they would be the same people as the <span class="accented">Mehunim</span>, mentioned <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a> (<span class="accented">Maon</span>, sing., and <span class="accented">Meunim</span>, plur.).

Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3</a>, in which passages, as here, the phrase <span class="accented">the strange gods</span> is the correct rendering; not, as in the margin, <span class="accented">gods of strangers.</span> The Hebrew phrase here rendered his <span class="cmt_word">soul was grieved</span> occurs <a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/11-2.htm">Zechariah 11:2</a>; it means <span class="accented">was impatient</span>  - literally, <span class="accented">was shortened</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he could bear it no longer.

The preliminary matter of Israel's sin, of their oppression by the Ammonites, of their repentance and return to the God of their fathers, and of God's merciful acceptance of their penitence and prayer, was concluded in the last verse.

But a new spirit was aroused among the Israelites. By whatever channel the bitter reproach in vers. 11-14 had been convey. ed to them, probably by the same channel, whether angel, or prophet, or high priest, had an answer of peace come to them on their repentance, and so they were roused and encouraged to resistance. As a first step, they <span class="cmt_word">encamped in Mizpeh</span> (see <a href="../../par/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11, 29, 34</a>). Mizpeh, or Mizpah of Gilead, is probably the same as Mizpah in Gilead where Laban and Jacob parted (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-25.htm">Genesis 31:25, 49</a>); as Ramoth-Mizpeh (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), called simply <span class="accented">Ramoth in Gilead</span> (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-80.htm">1 Chronicles 6:80</a>); and as the place well known in later Israelite history as <span class="accented">Ramoth-Gilead</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3, 6</a>), situated in the tribe of Gad, and a strong place of much importance. It was the place of national meeting for the whole of Gilead. <span class="accented">Mizpah</span> means <span class="accented">the watch-tower</span>, and would of course be upon a height, as the name <span class="accented">Ramoth-Mizpeh</span>, the heights of Mizpeh, also shows.

Gilead has two meanings: it is the name of the country so called (<a href="../../par/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>, note), and it is the name of the son or descendant of Machir the son of Manasseh (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-14.htm">1 Chronicles 7:14, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29, 30</a>). <span class="accented">Gileadite</span> also may be explained in two ways: it may mean an inhabitant of Gilead (<a href="../../par/judges/10-18.htm">Judges 10:18</a>), or it may mean a member of the family of the Gileadites, either an actual son or a more remote descendant of Gilead (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-29.htm">Numbers 26:29</a>) - two meanings which would usually coincide. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead begat Jephthah</span>. Here <span class="accented">Gilead</span> must mean the person so called, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the son or descendant of Machir, from whom the family, including Jephthah, were called Gileadites; but whether son or descendant cannot positively be affirmed. All that is certain is that he was that one of Maehir's descendants who was the head of that division of the Manassites who were called <span class="accented">Gileadites.</span> Again, when it is said <span class="accented">Gilead begat Jephthah</span>, we cannot be certain whether it is meant that Gilead was Jephthah's father, or merely his ancestor (see <a href="../../par/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-2.htm">Judges 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou <i>art</i> the son of a strange woman.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gilead's wife</span>. Whenever Gilead lived, besides the son by the foreign harlot, whom Jephthah represented, he had sons and descendants by his legitimate wife, who claimed to be his sole heirs, and who therefore drove Jephthah from the inheritance of their father's house. They might, as far as the language used is concerned, have been Gilead's own sons, or they may have been his grandsons or great-grandsons, and so either the brothers or the cousins and fellow-tribesmen of Jephthah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Tob</span>. This is certainly the same country as is spoken of in Ish-tob, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Tob, of whom 12,000 were hired by the children of Ammon to fight against David. They are thus named side by side with the men of Beth-Rehob, and Zoba, and Maacah, other small Aramean or Syrian states (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6, 8</a>). Tob is again mentioned in all probability in 1 Macc. 5:13; 2 Macc. 12:17, and the <span class="accented">Thauba</span> of Ptolemy agrees in situation as well as in name with Tob, but no identification with any existing place has been hitherto effected. <span class="cmt_word">Vain men</span>, as in <a href="../../par/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - This verse brings us back to <a href="../../par/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>, and reunites the two streams of narrative. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-5.htm">Judges 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders of Gilead</span>.

A military term, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24</a>. It is also used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a> for the <span class="accented">rulers</span> of Sodom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-7.htm">Judges 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did not ye hate me</span>, etc. Jephthah's reproach to the "elders of Gilead" strongly favours the idea that "his brethren" in ver. 3, and the "father's house" in ver. 2, are to be taken in the wider sense of fellow-tribesmen and "house of fathers," and that his expulsion was not the private act of his own brothers training him out of the house they lived in, but a tribal act (taking <span class="accented">tribe in</span> the sense of <span class="accented">house of fathers</span>), in which the elders of Gilead bad taken a part. If this is so, it removes a great difficulty about Jephthah being Gilead's son, which it is very hard to reconcile with chronology. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-8.htm">Judges 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</div><div class="comm">

The words may be taken as the laying down of the condition by Jephthah, to which in the following verse the elders express their assent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-10.htm">Judges 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.</div><div class="comm">

And this must be the meaning of the expression here. Jephthah was installed at the national place of gathering and consultation for Gilead, viz., at Mizpah in Gilead, into his office as bead of the State, and there, as in the capital, he performed all his duties under the sanctions of religion. Whether, however, the ark was brought there, or the altar, or a priest with an ephod, or whether some substitute was devised which the unsettled times might justify, it is impossible to say from want of information. There seems to be some reference in the words to Jephthah's vow, in ver. 31, as one of such utterances. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-12.htm">Judges 11:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jephthah sent</span>, etc. His first attempt was to make an honourable peace by showing that there was no just cause of quarrel. <span class="cmt_word">What hast thou to do with me?</span> or, rather, <span class="accented">What business</span>, what cause of quarrel, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">there between you and me?</span> (he speaks in the name of Israel, as head of the State) what is it all about?

He claimed the land between the Amen and the Jabbok as Ammonitish or Moabitish territory, and demanded its surrender as the only condition of peace. It appears from <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a> that part of the land of the tribe of Gad, that, namely, "on the western side of the upper Jabbok," had once belonged to the Ammonites, but had been conquered by the Amorites, from whom Israel took it, together with that which had formerly belonged to the Moabites.

He was an enemy of the Israelites, and yet when Israel took possession of the land, and dwelt in Heshbon, its capital, and the daughter cities or villages thereof, and in Aroer and her daughter cities or villages, and in all the cities on the banks of the Amen, Balak never strove about them with Israel, or went to war to recover them - a plain proof that he did not look upon them as his property.

The Septuagint for <span class="accented">Arnon</span> reads <span class="accented">Jordan</span>, which was the western boundary, as Arnon was the southern (ver. 22). The corresponding description in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> is, <span class="accented">From Aroer</span>, <span class="accented">which is by the brink of the river of Arnon</span>, <span class="accented">and from the city that is by the river</span>, <span class="accented">even unto Gilead</span>:, <span class="accented">there was not owe city too strong for us</span>: <span class="accented">the Lord our God delivered all unto us. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Three hundred years</span>. These words seem quite unintelligible and out of place. They are also chronologically impracticable. One expects the number of the cities, as in ver. 33, rather than the number of years; and it is remarkable that the whole number of cities taken by the Israelites on the east of Jordan must have been just about 300, since the half-tribe of Manasseh had sixty. If Gad and Reuben had the same proportion, it would be exactly 300 (5 &times; 60). <span class="cmt_word">Within that time</span>. The Hebrew phrase, which occurs about seventy times, invariably means <span class="accented">at that time</span>, and here can only refer to the time of the first settlement in the days of Balak, of which he had been speaking - another proof that the enumeration <span class="accented">three hundred years</span> is out of place here. If the reading <span class="accented">years is</span> not, as above suggested, an error for <span class="accented">cities</span>, the whole sentence, <span class="accented">three hundred years</span>, may very probably be an interpolation by a professed chronologist. The adding up of all the numbers of the servitudes and rests given in the book gives 301 years from the commencement of the oppression by Chushan-rishathaim to the death of Jair. But this method of reckoning gives the impossible period of 600 years from the exodus to the building of the temple.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 30, 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jephthah vowed a vow</span>. This verse and the following go back to relate something which preceded his passing over to the children of Ammon, viz., his rash and unhappy vow. This is related, as so many things in Scripture are, without note or comment, and the reader must pass his own sentence upon the deed. That sentence can only be one of unreserved con- detonation on the part of any one acquainted with the spirit and letter of the word of God. Many attempts have been made to show that Jephthah only contemplated the offering of an animal in sacrifice; but the natural and indeed necessary interpretation of the words shows that he had a human victim in mind. He could not expect any but a human being to come forth from the doors of his house, nor could any but a human being come forth "to meet him" - a common phrase always spoken of men (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/24-65.htm">Genesis 24:65</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-14.htm">Exodus 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-7.htm">Exodus 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-20.htm">Numbers 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>, etc., and below in ver. 34). Obviously, in the greatness of his danger and the extreme hazard of his undertaking (<a href="../../par/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a>), he thought to propitiate God's favour by a terrible and extraordinary vow. But if we ask how Jephthah came to have such erroneous notions of the character of God, the answer is not far to seek. Jephthah was "the son of a strange woman," probably, as we have seen, a Syrian (<a href="../../par/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1-11</a>, note), and had passed many years of his life as an exile in Syria. Now it is well known that human sacrifices were frequently practised in Syria, as they were also by the Ammonites, who made their children pass through the fire to Moloch, and it cannot surprise us that a man brought up as Jephthah was, and leading the life of a freebooter at the head of a band of Syrian outlaws, should have the common Syrian notion of the efficacy of human sacrifices in great emergencies. His language, indeed, about Jehovah and Chemosh in ver. 24 savoured of semi-heathenism. Nor is it any valid objection that we are told in ver. 29 that "the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah." The phrase does not mean that thenceforth he was altogether under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, so that all that he did was inspired by the Spirit of truth and wisdom, but that the Spirit of the Lord inspired him with extraordinary strength and power for the great task of leading Israel to battle against the Ammonites. <span class="cmt_word">And I will offer</span>. The rendering suggested by some, or I will offer, meaning, if the first. comer is a human being he shall be the Lord's, or if it is an animal I will offer it as a burnt offering, is wholly inadmissible.

The narrator takes up again the thread of the narrative, which was interrupted at ver. 29, the words <span class="accented">he passed over up</span>, <span class="accented">to the children of Ammon</span> being repeated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-33.htm">Judges 11:33</a></div><div class="verse">And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, <i>even</i> twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter.

The <span class="accented">Aroer</span> here mentioned seems to be that in the tribe of Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>), now <span class="accented">Nahr Amman. Minnith</span> is thought to have been situated four Roman miles from Heshbon, on the road to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, afterwards called Philadelphia. It was called <span class="accented">Manith</span> in the time of Eusebius. <span class="cmt_word">The plain of the vineyards</span>, better taken as a proper name, <span class="accented">Abel</span>-<span class="accented">ceramim.</span> The site is not certainly known. Eusebius speaks of two <span class="accented">Abels</span>, both fertile in vineyards, one seven Roman miles from Rabbah, which is probably the one here meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she <i>was his</i> only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To his house</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought me very low</span> - literally, <span class="accented">thou hast thoroughly bowed me down</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">I cannot go back</span>. A forcible illustration of the evil of rash vows. He who makes them is so placed that he must sin. If he breaks his vow, he has taken God's name in vain; if he keeps it, he breaks one of God's commandments. So it was with Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24, 39-45</a>), with Herod (<a href="../../par/mark/6-23.htm">Mark 6:23</a>); so it has often been since with those who have made unauthorised vows, and who in attempting to keep them have fallen into deadly sin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-36.htm">Judges 11:36</a></div><div class="verse">And she said unto him, My father, <i>if</i> thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, <i>even</i> of the children of Ammon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My father</span>, etc. See <a href="../../par/numbers/32-2.htm">Numbers 32:2</a>. The touching submission of Jephthah's daughter to her unnatural and terrible fate, while it reveals a most lovable character, seems also to show that the idea of a human sacrifice was not so strange to her mind as it is to ours. The sacrifice of his eldest son as a burnt offering by the king of Moab, some 300 years later, as related <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; the intended sacrifices of Iphigenia and of Phrixus in Greek mythology; the sacrifices of children to Moloch, so often spoken of in Scripture; the question in <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>, "Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?" the Phoenician custom mentioned by Sanchoniatho (quoted by Porphyry), of sacrificing to Saturn one of those most dear to them in times of war, pestilence, or drought; the yearly sacrifice at Carthage of a boy chosen by lot ('Sil. Italicus,' 4, 765), and many other examples, prove the prevalence of human sacrifices in early times, and in heathen lands. This must be borne in mind in reading the history of Jephthah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-37.htm">Judges 11:37</a></div><div class="verse">And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And bewail my virginity</span>. It is a striking evidence of the strong desire among Hebrew women to be mothers, as seen in Sarah, Rachel, Hannah, and others, that it was the prospect of dying unmarried which seemed to Jephthah's daughter the saddest part of her fate. So in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-63.htm">Psalm 78:63</a>, <span class="accented">their maidens were not given to marriage</span> is one of the items of the misery of Israel (see too ver. 39). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/11-38.htm">Judges 11:38</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go. And he sent her away <i>for</i> two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</div><div class="comm">

Nothing can be more express than this statement. In fact, except the natural horror we feel at a human sacrifice, there is nothing to cast the least shade of doubt upon the fact that Jephthah's daughter was offered up as a burnt offering, in accordance with heathen notions, but, as Josephus says, neither "conformably to the law, nor acceptably to God." Most of the early Jewish commentators and all the Christian Fathers for ten or eleven centuries (Origen, Chrysostom, Theo-doret, Jerome, Augustine, etc.) held this view. Luther's comment is, "Some affirm that he did not sacrifice her, but the text is clear enough." <span class="cmt_word">She knew</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">she had known</span>.

A similar difference exists at the present day between the pronunciation of the inhabitants of different parts of Germany. What the Hanoverians call <span class="accented">stein</span>, a stone, the other Germans call <span class="accented">shtein.

It is possible that the war between Jephthah and the Ephraimites may have lasted a considerable time, though only the single incident of the slaughter at the fords of Jordan is mentioned, so that the large number of 42,000 men may be less improbable than it seems at first sight. There is, however, always some doubt as to the correctness of numbers (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/12-7.htm">Judges 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Jephthah judged Israel six years.

The Septuagint, Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions read, "in his city Gilead," as if Gilead had been the name of Jephthah's paternal city. Another conjecture is that there might have been an <span class="accented">Ar of Gilead</span> as well as the well-known Ar of Moab, or there might have been a collection of towns called Arey- Gilead (the towns of Gilead), after the analogy of Havoth-jair (<a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>), but there is no evidence in support of these conjectures. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 12:8-15

It is uncertain whether Bethlehem of Judah is meant, or Bethlehem in the tribe of Zebu-lun, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Josephus says that Ibzan was of the tribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem, and some have supposed a connection between the names of Boaz and Ibzan. ' But as Bethlehem of the tribe of Judah is generally called Bethlehem of Judah, or Bethlehem-Ephratah, and as Elon and Abdon were judges in North-East Israel, it is perhaps more probable that Bethlehem of Zebulun is meant. Dr. Robinson has identified it with a village - a "very miserable one" - called <span class="accented">Beit Lahm</span>, six miles west of Nazareth.

It is remarkable that the two names <span class="accented">Elon</span> and <span class="accented">Aijalon</span> are identical in Hebrew as far as the consonants are concerned.

It by no means follows from this phrase that this chapter is in direct chronological sequence to the preceding The scene is shifted to the tribe of Dan, and to the Philistines on the west, and there is nothing to guide us as to the exact time when the things narrated occurred. But the end of the forty years probably coincided with the judgeship of Samuel; for there was no complete deliverance in the time of Samson, only occasional cheeks to the Philistine domination (see ver. 5). It was not till the days of Samuel that the Philistines were really smitten (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-14</a>). We may suppose the date of the ensuing narrative to be somewhere in the first decade of the Philistine oppression.

It is almost always coupled with Eshtaol, as in ver. 25 of this chapter. It was situated in the Shephelah, or plain country, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-10.htm">2 Chronicles 11:10</a>).

A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a <span class="accented">Nazi-rite</span>) means one <span class="accented">separated</span>, and specially dedicated to God.

Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with "the hair of the head of his separation," as we read in <a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall begin</span>, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did.

His manner will be to live as a Nazarite, and his action or work will be to begin to deliver israel (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>, where both the <span class="accented">manner</span> and the actione of Ishmael are foretold). In fact, Manoah's question refers directly to vers. 4 and 5, and is a request to have a confirmation of what was then said; just as David asked again and again, <span class="accented">What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine?</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26, 30</a>).

The angel, perhaps perceiving that Manoah was in doubt as to who he might be, had a holy dread lest he might offer the kid to him, just as the angel whom St. John was about to worship said, "See thou do it not" (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-9.htm">Revelation 22:9</a>); and Barnabas and Paul ran in among the people of Lycaonia to restrain them from offering sacrifice to them (<a href="../../par/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14-18</a>). The order of the words, which is rightly given in the A.V., makes it a clear direction to offer the sacrifice to no one but the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a></div><div class="verse">And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What <i>is</i> thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is thy name</span>? See note to ver. 6. The phrase is very peculiar, literally, <span class="accented">Who is thy name?</span> as if he had been going to say, <span class="accented">Who art thou?</span> and then changed the form to is <span class="accented">thy name.</span> The Hebrews seem to have attached great importance to names, a circumstance due, in part, to every name being significant in the spoken language (see <a href="../../par/genesis/4-1.htm">Genesis 4:1, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/5-29.htm">Genesis 5:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-5.htm">Genesis 16:5</a>, etc.; Genesis 17:19; 25:25, 26; 29 and Genesis 30; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a> <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-4.htm">Isaiah 62:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>, etc., and. many other passages). Compare also the phrase, <span class="accented">the name of the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-19.htm">Exodus 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-5.htm">Exodus 34:5, 6, 7</a>). Manoah had certainly some suspicious as to the mysterious character of his visitor, and expected the name to reveal his true nature. <span class="cmt_word">We may do thee honour</span>. Manoah seems throughout to use ambiguous language, suitable either to a man, if he was speaking to a man, or to a celestial visitant, should he be angel or God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it <i>is</i> secret?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is secret</span>.

His name was one which, as St. Paul expresses it, it is not lawful, or possible, for a man to utter (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>), it was so transcendently wonderful. The feeling of the Hebrews in abstaining from uttering the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> was akin to this.

And so Isaiah said, "Woe is me! for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). So again the Lord said to Moses, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The name of the well, Beer-lahai-roi, is also thought to mean the well of him that is alive after seeing God (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). And Jacob called the name of the place where he wrestled with the angel Peniel, "for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). See too <a href="../../par/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>. The same belief also prevailed amongst the heathen, that seeing a god without his special permission was visited by death or some grave calamity, as Callimachus, quoted by Grotius, says- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The laws of Saturn thus decree,<br />Who dares immortal gods to see<br />Shall suffer loss, whoe'er he be."</span>

With the acceptance of the sacrifice the conscience was cleared from guilt. The ascent of the angel in the flame of the altar was to her the same evidence of an accepted sacrifice as the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus are to us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/13-24.htm">Judges 13:24</a></div><div class="verse">And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his name Samson</span>. No doubt the name was significant of what the child should be (see note to ver. 17), but the etymology and meaning of the name are doubtful. Josephus ('Antiq.,' V. 8:4) says the name means "a strong one," but he does not say in what language, and it does not appear to have such a meaning in any Semitic dialect. It is commonly interpreted to mean <span class="accented">like the sun</span>, from <span class="accented">shemesh</span>, the common word for the sun; and so Jerome in his 'Onomasticon' expounds it as <span class="accented">the sun's strength</span>,' possibly with an allusion to <a href="../../par/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>. Others make it equal <span class="accented">shim-</span>shorn, from the Pilpel conjugation of <span class="accented">shamem</span>, <span class="accented">to devastate.</span> Another possible derivation is from the Chaldee <span class="accented">shemash</span>, <span class="accented">to minister</span>, specially in sacred things, a root from which the Nestorian, Syriac, and Arabic names for a deacon are derived. If this were the derivation, it would be a reference to his dedication to God as a Nazarite from his mother's womb, the only thing his mother knew about him when she gave him the name.

All the preliminaries being settled between the parents, he returned to Timnath to take his bride by the same road which he and his parents had travelled by before, and, remembering his feat in killing the lion, very naturally turned aside to see what had become of the carcase. <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, there was a swarm of bees</span>, etc. This has been objected to as improbable, because bees are very dainty, and would not approach a putrefying body. But as a considerable time had elapsed, it is very possible that either the mere skeleton was left, or that the heat of the sun had dried up the body and reduced it to the state of a mummy without decomposition, as is said to happen often in the desert of Arabia.

It is not clear what is meant by this mention of his father alone; but it was probably some part of the wedding etiquette that the father should go to the bride first alone; perhaps, as Kimehi says, to give her notice of the bridegroom's approach, that she might get ready. Among the preparations may have been the selection of the thirty young men to be "the children of the bride-chamber" (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>). As these were all Philistines, the inference is that they were selected by the bride, just as with us the bride has the privilege of choosing the minister who is to officiate at the marriage.

We still see a strong resemblance to the wedding arrangements referred to in <a href="../../par/matthew/9-15.htm">Matthew 9:15</a>, and Matthew 25:1-12; only in this case they were young men instead of young women who went out to meet the bridegroom. We may observe, by the way, that the scale of the wedding feast, as regards numbers and duration, indicates that Samson s family was one of wealth and position. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find <i>it</i> out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span>  -  <span class="cmt_word">Riddle</span>.

There is some apparent difficulty in understanding how to reconcile this statement with what was said in ver. 14, that they could not in <span class="accented">three days</span> expound the riddle; and also with what is said in vers. 16 and 17, that Samson's wife <span class="accented">wept before him the seven days of the feast.</span> And several different readings have arisen from this difficulty: viz., in this verse, the reading of the <span class="accented">fourth</span> day for the <span class="accented">seventh</span>, and the omission of the words, <span class="accented">And it came to pass on the seventh day</span>; and, in the latter part of ver. 14, seven days for three days. But all difficulty will disappear if we bear in mind the peculiarity of Hebrew narrative noticed in note to section vers. 1-6 of ch. 2, when we come to consider ver. 16. <span class="cmt_word">Entice thy husband</span>. Cf. <a href="../../par/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That he may declare unto us</span>.

And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told <i>it</i> my father nor my mother, and shall I tell <i>it</i> thee?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson's wife</span>, etc. This statement does not follow ver. 15, but is a <span class="accented">parallel</span> narrative to that beginning in ver. 14, "<span class="accented">And they could not in three days</span>," etc., down to the end of ver. 15, bringing the story down to the same point of time, viz., the seventh day. One stream of the narrative tells us what the young men did when Samson had propounded his riddle; the other tells us what Samson's wife did. From the very first, no doubt, she had wished to be in the secret, not perhaps from treacherous motives, but from curiosity, and the natural desire to be in her husband's confidence, and she pressed her request with cajolery and petulance. The young men at the same time had tried to find out the riddle by fair means. But on the seventh day they threatened to burn her and her father unless she found out the riddle for them, and under the terror of this threat she extracted the secret from Samson and divulged it to the Philistine young men. The only difficulty is to explain why a gap of four days occurs in the account between vers. 14 and 15. The most likely thing is, that after three days' vain attempt to find out the riddle, they began to tamper with Samson's wife, offering her money, as the Philistine lords did to Delilah (<a href="../../par/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), though the narrative does not mention it; but that on the seventh day, becoming desperate, and thinking that the woman was not doing her best, they resorted to the dreadful threat of burning her. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/14-17.htm">Judges 14:17</a></div><div class="verse">And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She lay sore upon him</span>.

This is the uncommon word for the sun used also in <a href="../../par/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a>, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">What is sweeter</span>, etc. They put their answer in a form to make it seem as if they had guessed the riddle; but Samson instantly perceived his wife's treachery, and showed that he did so by quoting the proverb of plowing with another person s heifer. They had not used their own wit to find out the riddle, but had learnt the secret at Samson's cost, through his wife. He insinuates that had they acted fairly he would have won the wager.

The verb here, <span class="accented">came upon him</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> the same as in ver. 6. Thirty men - the number of the companions to whom he felt bound to pay the thirty changes of garment. Ashkelon (<a href="../../par/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>) - one of the five Philistine cities, but the least often mentioned, owing, it is thought, to its remote situation "on the extreme edge of the shore of the Mediterranean, far down in the south." It still preserves its ancient name, and was famous in the time of the Crusaders. "Within the walls and towers now standing Richard (Coeur de Lion) held his court." The onion called eschalot, or shallot, is named from Eshkalon, or Ashkalon. <span class="cmt_word">Their spoil</span> - that which was stripped from them. <span class="cmt_word">His anger was kindled</span> - against the Philistines in general, and his wife in particular, so that he went back to his father s house without her.

The parents of the Thimnathite, having no doubt obtained Samson's dower, and supposing him to have finally broken with his treacherous wife, proceeded to give her in marriage to the Philistine young man who had been Samson's friend - perhaps the man to whom she had told the riddle. The sad end of this unhappy alliance fully justified the opposition of Samson's parents to it in ver. 3. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../judges/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Judges 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Judges 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/judges/15.htm"><title>Judges 15 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/judges/15.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/judges/15.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/judges/15-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../judges/14.htm" title="Judges 14">&#9668;</a> Judges 15 <a href="../judges/16.htm" title="Judges 16">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1</a></div><div class="verse">But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber.

A clever sportsman, as no doubt Samson was, would have no difficulty whatever in netting or snaring 300 jackals, which always move in packs, and would be attracted by the vineyards of Thimnathah, for which their partiality is well known (see <a href="../../par/judges/14-5.htm">Judges 14:5</a>, note). The writer of the additional article <span class="accented">Fox</span> in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' states that he had tried the experiment of throwing grapes to the foxes, jackals, and wolves in the Zoological Gardens. The wolves would not touch them, the others ate them with avidity. <span class="cmt_word">Took firebrands</span>, etc. Many cavils have been directed against the truth of this account, but without the slightest reason. The terrified animals, with the burning torches and the blazing straw behind them, would necessarily run forwards. Samson would, of course, start the couples at numerous different points, and no doubt have a number of Hebrews to assist him. To the present day the corn-fields in that part of the <span class="accented">Shephelah</span> extend continuously for twenty or thirty miles.

Possibly the Philistines, in their fear of Samson, and perhaps also from a rude sense of justice, inflicted this punishment upon the Thimnathite and her father as the real authors of the destruction of their corn-fields, by giving Samson so unheard-of provocation. Note the fact of the identical fate overtaking Samson's wife which she had sought to escape by base treachery (cf. <a href="../../par/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> with what actually happened). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-7.htm">Judges 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samson said</span>, etc. There are two ways of understanding Samson's speech: one, with the A.V., as meaning to say that though the Philistines had taken his part, and repudiated all fellowship in the shameful deed of the Thimnathite and her father, yet he would have his full revenge upon them; the other, translating the particle in its more common sense of if, makes him say, "If this is the way you treat me, be sure I will not cease till I have had my full revenge." This is perhaps on the whole the most probable meaning. It still leaves it uncertain whether the Philistines meant to do Samson justice, or to do him an additional injury, by putting his wife and her father to death. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/15-8.htm">Judges 15:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He smote them hip and thigh</span>, etc. A proverbial expression, the origin of which is uncertain; it means, he smote them with a great and complete slaughter. It is reasonable to suppose that he had gathered a few Hebrews round him to help him. <span class="cmt_word">He went down</span>, etc. This shows that <span class="accented">Etam</span> must have been situated lower than Tinmath, and seems to preclude its identification with <span class="accented">Urtas</span>, in the hill country of Judah, between Bethlehem and Tekoah, which apparently represents the <span class="accented">Etam</span> of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>.

It should be the <span class="accented">cleft</span>, as in ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Knowest thou not</span>, etc. The language of these cowardly men shows how completely the Philistine yoke was fastened upon the necks of Judah. The history gives no account of the Philistine conquest; except the brief allusion in <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6, 7</a>; but Samson's story brings to light the existence of it. The abject state to which they were reduced is shown By their complaint of Samson, What is this that thou hast done unto us?" instead of hailing him as a deliverer. <span class="cmt_word">As they did unto me</span>, etc. It is instructive to read Samson's defence of himself in the very words used by the Philistines in ver. 10. "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." There is no end to rendering "evil for evil."

The A.V. (as the Septuagint and Vulgate seem to have done, and Luther and others) has quite misconceived the statement in the text, as if God had cloven a hollow place in the jawbone, and brought out the water thence; whereas the statement is quite clear that <span class="accented">God clave the hollow place which is in Lehi</span> (<span class="accented">hal-Lehi</span>, ver. 9, note), and that a spring of water came out, to which Samson gave the name <span class="accented">En-hakkorch</span>, the spring of him that called upon God, which name continued till the time of the writer. The spring apparently continued till the time of St. Jerome, and of other later writers, in the seventh, twelfth, and fourteenth centuries; but Robinson was unable to identify it with any certainty ('B.R.,' 2:64). The word translated the (not a) <span class="accented">hollow place</span> (ham-<span class="accented">maktesh</span>) means a <span class="accented">mortar</span>; also the <span class="accented">cavity in the jaw</span> from which the molar teeth grow.

It looks as if it had been the intention to close the history of Samson with these Words, but that ch. 16. was subsequently added, possibly from other sources. Compare the close of chs. 20. and 21. of the Gospel of St. John.

It played an important part in history in all ages - in the times, of the Pharaohs, the Seleucidae, the Maccabees, the Romans, the Khalifs, and the Crusaders. It was within the limits of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>). It is first mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>, as the south-west border of the Canaanites. Its real transliteration from the Hebrew is Azzah, as it is actually expressed in the A.V. of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>.

These words have no doubt accidentally fallen out of the Hebrew text, but they are necessary to the sense, and are expressed in all the ancient versions. We have no clue as to the motive of Samson's visit to Gaza, whether he was meditating its conquest, or an assault upon its inhabitants, or whether he came merely in the wild spirit of adventure, or upon civil business. We only know that he came there, that, with his usual weakness, he fell into the snare of female blandishments, that the Philistines thought to have caught him and killed him, but that he escaped by his supernatural strength. Gaza is about thirteen hours' march from Thimnathah. <span class="cmt_word">They compassed him in</span>. The Hebrew does not express this idea, nor is it what the Gazites did. It should be rendered, <span class="accented">They went about and lay in wait for him.</span> Instead of attacking him directly, they took a round-about course, and set an ambush for him in the city gates, probably in the guard-room by the side of the gate, intending when he came forth unsuspectingly in the morning, at the hour of opening the gates, to rush upon him and kill him.

Possibly the woman had learnt the plot, and gave Samson warning, after the manner of Rahab; or she may have been his betrayer, and reckoned upon retaining him till the morning; anyhow he arose at midnight, when the liers in wait were sleeping securely, and tearing up the two gate-pests, with the gates and the cross-bar attached to them, walked off with them "as far as the top of the hill that is before Hebron." <span class="cmt_word">Took the doors</span>, etc. Rather, <span class="accented">laid hold of.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">went away with them</span>, translate <span class="accented">plucked them up.</span> It is the technical word for plucking up the tent pins. <span class="cmt_word">Bar and all</span>, or, <span class="accented">with the bar.</span> The bar was probably a strong iron or wooden crossbar, which was attached to the posts by a lock, and could only be removed by one that had the key.

Hebron "was about nine geographical, or between ten and eleven English, miles from Gaza, situated in a deep, narrow valley, with high hills on either side." It is approached from Gaza over a high ridge, from the top of which Hebron becomes visible, lying in the valley below at fifty minutes' distance. This spot would suit very well the description, "the hill that is before Hebron." Some, however, think that the hill called <span class="accented">el Montar</span>, about three-quarters of an hour from Gaza, on the road to Hebron, is here meant, and that the plain <span class="accented">before Hebron</span> merely means <span class="accented">towards</span>, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/18-16.htm">Genesis 18:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>.

The Septuagint and many commentators understand that she used the pin (it is the common word for a tent pin) to fasten the loom or frame to the ground, or to the wall. But a good sense comes out if we understand the phrase to mean, <span class="accented">So she struck with the shuttle</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she did what Samson told her to do, viz., wove his locks into the warp which was already prepared. This was done by successive strokes of the shuttle, to which the hair was fastened. <span class="accented">To strike with the peg or shuttle</span> may have been the technical phrase for throwing the shuttle with the woof into the warp; and it is a strong argument in favour of this interpretation that it makes her action the simple fulfilment of his directions. He said, "Weave my locks into the warp. So she struck with the shuttle." <span class="cmt_word">With the pin of the beam, and with the web</span>. The Hebrew word '<span class="accented">ereg</span> cannot mean <span class="accented">the beam</span>, as it is here translated; it is the substantive of the verb <span class="accented">to weave</span> in ver. 13. Its obvious meaning, therefore, is <span class="accented">the woof.</span> The pin of the woof, therefore, is the shuttle with the woof attached to it, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Samson's hair, which was firmly woven into the <span class="accented">warp.</span> He went away with. This is the same word as was applied in ver. 3 to his <span class="accented">plucking up</span> the gateposts. Now, with the strength of his neck, he tore up the shuttle which fastened his hair to the warp, and so dragged the whole solid frame along with it. However, as we do not know the technical term of the art of the weaving among the Hebrews and Philistines, nor the precise construction of their looms, some obscurity necessarily attaches to this description.

Both the male and female divinities seem to have had the head and breast and hands human, and the rest of the body fish-shaped (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). The fish was a natural emblem of fertility and productiveness, especially to a maritime people. The fish-shaped idol is found upon old Phoenician coins, and also on the monuments of Khorsabad, and on some Assyrian gems in the British Museum. One of the chief temples of Dagon was at Gaza. Several towns bore the name of Dagon, as <span class="accented">Beth-dagon</span> in Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>) and in Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), <span class="accented">Caphar-dagon</span> near Diospolis, etc., showing that the worship of Dagon was widespread.

Not on the occasion of his being brought into the temple as mentioned in ver. 25, but after his capture, and whenever they saw him grinding or elsewhere. It was this universal ascription of praise to Dagon that led to the celebration of this great feast. This praise of Dagon is also dwelt upon to show that God, in what happened, vindicated the glory of his own great name, which was blasphemed by the servants of Dagon when they thus made him superior to Jehovah. So Milton makes Samson say, "All the contest is now 'Twixt God and Dagon .... He, be sure, will not connive or linger, thus provoked, but will arise, and his great name assert." Generally, the 'Samson Agonistes' is an excellent commentary on the history of Samson.

It is not certain whether the idea conveyed is that of the A.V., that Samson was brought there to be as it were baited by the populace, jeered and jested at, reviled and reproached, perhaps struck or pelted; or whether the words do not simply mean to <span class="accented">dance with music</span>, which is certainly the meaning of the latter verb (he made sport before them, A.V. and margin) in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a> (<span class="accented">played</span>, A.V.; see ver. 6); <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>. <span class="cmt_word">They set him between the pillars</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when he had done dancing; because he must have been dancing outside the house for the people on the roof to see him.

The roof itself was fiat, and had the weight of 3000 people upon it, throwing a great strain upon the beams which rested upon the pillars. The sudden removal of the pillars would bring the roof down at that end, crowded as it was with the people, and would inevitably drag the whole mass in the same direction one over another, while the swaying of the people would bring the whole roof down upon the heads of those beneath, who would be crushed by the heavy timbers and stones and bodies of men falling upon them.

Perhaps we may see in this an evidence that his affliction and shame had not been without their effect, in bringing him back to God humbled and penitent. The language is very earnest.

The threefold name by which he addresses the Almighty implies great tension of spirit. <span class="cmt_word">That I may be at once avenged</span>.

The parallel between Samson and Hercules is in many respects very remarkable, and has been drawn out by Serdrius and others. The supernatural strength of each, the slavery to women ("Quem non mille for, quem non Sthenellius hostis, Non potuit Mayors vincere, vicit amor." Ovid), the tearing asunder of the lion, the violent death of each, partly voluntary and partly forced, are all points of strong general resemblance. But one of the most remarkable is the connection of Hercules with two pillars. The "pillars of Hercules" on each side the straits of Gibraltar, Mount Abila and Mount Calpe, were said to have been rent asunder by the strength of Hercules' arms. And Herodotus relates that in the temple of Hercules at Tyre were two remarkable pillars, one of refined gold, the other of smaragdus, some green stone like an emerald (2:44). But the account given of a visit of Hercules to Egypt is still more remarkable, as compared with the history of the binding of Samson and the slaughter of the Philistines, as related in ch. 15. The following are the words of Herodotus: - "The Greeks say that when Hercules went down to Egypt, the Egyptians surrounded him, and led him in a procession to sacrifice him to Jupiter; that he kept quite still for a time, but that when they were commencing the sacrifice at the altar" (the first act of which was cutting off the hair) "he turned in self-defence, and by his prowess slew them all." On which Herodo. tus remarks, "How was it possible for him, being but one, and being only a man, to slay many myriads?" The prevalence of the worship of Hercules among the Phoenicians, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, at Tyre and Thasos, a Phoenician colony, and the close connection of Egypt with Gaza, where the prowess of Samson was so well known, are points not to be omitted in considering the probability of some of the legends of Hercules being drawn from the history of Samson.

We no longer have to do with judges and their mighty deeds in delivering Israel from his oppressors, but with two detached histories, which fill up the rest of the book, relating to the internal affairs of Israel. There is no note of time, except that they happened before the time of Saul the king (<a href="../../par/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), and. that Phinehas the son of Eleazar was alive at the time of the occurrence of the second (<a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>). Both, no doubt, are long prior to Samson. The only apparent connection of the history of Micah with that of Samson is that both relate to the tribe of Dan, and it may be presumed were contained in the annals of that tribe. Compare the opening of the Books of Samuel (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mount Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hill country of Ephraim, as in <a href="../../par/judges/3-27.htm">Judges 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24</a>, etc.

See <a href="../../par/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Thou cursedst</span>. The Cethib and the Alexandrian Codex of the Septuagint read, <span class="accented">Thou cursedst</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. adjuredst me, which is a better reading. There is a direct and verbal reference to the law contained in <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>. The word <span class="accented">thou cursedst</span> here and the voice of <span class="accented">swearing</span> in Leviticus are the same root. It was in consequence of this <span class="accented">adjuration</span> that Micah confessed his guilt. Compare <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>, when our Lord, on the adjuration of the high priest, broke his silence and confessed that he was Christ, the Son of God. In Achan's confession (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19, 20</a>) there is no distinct reference to <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, though this may have been the ground of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when he had restored the eleven hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had wholly dedicated</span>. It is not clear whether the words are to be rendered as in the A.V., <span class="accented">had</span> <span class="accented">dedicated</span>, expressing the dedication of them before they were stolen, or whether they merely express her present purpose so to dedicate them. But the A.V. makes very good sense. Her former purpose had been that the money should be given for her son's benefit to make his house an house of gods. Now that he had confessed, she resumed her purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore I restore it unto thee</span> - that is, in the shape of the graven and molten images, as it follows in the next verse. The narrative gives a curious example of the semi-idolatry of the times. <span class="cmt_word">A graven image and a molten image</span>. There  is a good deal of difficulty in assigning the exact meaning of the two words here used, and their relation to one another in the worship to which they belong. <span class="accented">The molten image</span> (<span class="accented">massechah</span>), however, seems to be pretty certainly the <span class="accented">metal</span>, here the <span class="accented">silver</span>, image of a calf, the form which the corrupt worship of Jehovah took from the time when Aaron made the molten calf (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>, called there '<span class="accented">egel massechah</span>, a molten calf) to the time when Jeroboam set up the golden calves at Dan and Bethel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28, 29</a>). And that <span class="accented">massechah</span> means something <span class="accented">molten is</span> certain both from its etymology (<span class="accented">nasach</span>, to pour) and from what Aaron said in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-24.htm">Exodus 32:24</a>: "I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf." Here too Micah's mother gives the silver to the founder, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the fuser of metals. The <span class="accented">pesel</span>, or <span class="accented">graven image</span>, on the other hand, is something hewn or graven, whether in wood or stone, and sometimes overlaid with gold and silver (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). One might have thought, from the language of ver. 4, and from the mention of the <span class="accented">pesel</span> alone in <a href="../../par/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30, 31</a>, that only one image is here intended, which was graven with the chisel after it was cast, as Aaron's calf seems to have been. But in <a href="../../par/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17, 18</a> they are mentioned separately, with the ephod and teraphim named between them, so that they must be distinct. From the above passages the <span class="accented">pesel or graven image</span> would seem to have been the most important object, and the difficulty is to assign the true relation of the <span class="accented">massechah</span> or <span class="accented">molten image</span> to it. Hengstenberg thinks the <span class="accented">massechah</span> was a pedestal on which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> stood, and that the ephod was the robe with which the <span class="accented">pesel</span> was clothed, and that the teraphim were certain tokens or emblems attached to the ephod which gave oracular answers. But this is not much more than guess-work. Berthean considers the ephod, here as elsewhere, to be the priest's garment, put on when performing the most solemn services, and specially when seeking an answer from God. And he thinks that the <span class="accented">massechah</span> formed a part of the ornament of the ephod, because in <a href="../../par/judges/18-18.htm">Judges 18:18</a> the Hebrew has "the <span class="accented">pesel</span> of the ephod." The teraphin he thinks are idols, a kind of <span class="accented">Dii minores</span> associated with the worship of Jehovah in this impure worship. But there does not seem to be any means at present of arriving at any certainty. The <span class="accented">massechah</span> might be a rich gold or silver overlaying of the wooden image, possibly movable, or it might be the separate image of a calf supposed to belong, as it were, to the <span class="accented">pesel</span>, and to symbolise the attributes of the Godhead. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred <i>shekels</i> of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet he restored</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">so he</span> <span class="accented">restored</span>, repeating what was said in ver. 3, and adding the consequence, that his mother took two hundred shekels and gave them to the founder. It is a great puzzle to explain why <span class="accented">two hundred</span> shekels only are here spoken of, and what became of the other <span class="accented">nine hundred.</span> Bertheau thinks the <span class="accented">two hundred</span> were different from the eleven hundred, and were the fifth part of the whole value stolen, which the thief, according to <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-5.htm">Leviticus 6:5</a>, was bound to give in addition to the principal. He therefore translates ver. 4 thus: "So he restored the money to his mother (and his mother took two hundred shekels), and she gave it (the money 1100 shekels) to the founder," etc. Others understand that two hundred only were actually made into the graven and molten image, and the other nine hundred were devoted to other expenses of the worship. <span class="cmt_word">In the house of Micah</span>. This explains, <span class="accented">Now I will restore it unto thee</span>, and, <span class="accented">for my son to</span> make, etc., in ver. 3. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man Micah</span>, etc. It is impossible to say for certain whether the state of things here described in respect of Micah preceded the events narrated in the preceding verses, or was consequent upon them. If it preceded, then we have the reason of his mother's vow: she wished to make her son's "house of God" complete by the addition of a graven and molten image. If it was consequent upon his mother's vow, then we have in the opening verses of this chapter a history of the circumstances of the foundation of Micah's "house of God," which was to play an important part in the colony of Danites, whose proceedings arc related in the following chapter, and for the sake of which this domestic history of Micah is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">House of gods</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">of God</span> (Elohim); for the worship was of Jehovah, only with a corrupt and semi-idolatrous ceremonial. <span class="cmt_word">An ephod</span>. See <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26, 27</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Teraphim</span>. See <a href="../../par/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a> (images, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a> (idolatry, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); 19:13 (an image, A.V.; teraphim, Hebrews); <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>,to etc. They seem to have been a kind of Penates, or household gods, and were used for divination (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-2.htm">Zechariah 10:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Became his priest</span>. One function of the priest, and for which it is likely he was much resorted to, was to inquire of God by the ephod (<a href="../../par/judges/18-5.htm">Judges 18:5, 6</a>). What his other duties might be does not appear. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">In those days <i>there was</i> no king in Israel, <i>but</i> every man did <i>that which was</i> right in his own eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was no king</span>. This must have been written in the days of the kings of Israel and Judah, and perhaps with reference to the efforts of such kings as Ass (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>) to put down idolatry.

These words are difficult to explain. If the man was a Levite he could not be of the family or tribe of Judah. Some explain the words to be merely a more accurate definition of Bethlehem-judah, as if he would say, I <span class="accented">mean Bethlehem in the tribe of Judah.</span> Others explain them to mean that he was one of a family of Levites who had settled in Bethlehem, and so came to be reckoned in civil matters as belonging to Judah. Others, that he was of the family of Judah on his mother s side, which might be the cause of his settling at Bethlehem. But many commentators think them spurious, as they are not found in the Septuagint (Cod. Vat.), nor in the Peschito, nor in No. 440 of De Rossi's MSS. The Septuagint has <span class="accented">Bethlehem of the family of Judah.</span>

This is not a common application of the word father in the Old Testament. The prominent idea seems to be one of honour, combined with authority to teach and advise. It is applied to prophets (<a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-21.htm">2 Kings 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-14.htm">2 Kings 13:14</a>), and to Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-8.htm">Genesis 45:8</a>). The idea is implied in the converse phrase of <span class="accented">son</span>, applied to those to whom the prophets stood in 'the relation of spiritual fathers (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-10.htm">Proverbs 4:10, 20</a>, and frequently elsewhere). The abuse of the feeling which dictates the term as applied to human teachers is reproved by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-9.htm">Matthew 23:9</a>). It has been freely used in the Christian Church, as in the titles <span class="accented">papa</span> or <span class="accented">pope</span> applied to bishops, <span class="accented">abbot</span> and <span class="accented">abbas</span>, <span class="accented">father in God</span>, <span class="accented">fathers of the Church</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> Here there is perhaps a special reference to the function of Micah's priest to ask counsel of God, and then give that counsel to those who came to inquire (see note to ver. 5). It may be added that the idea of <span class="accented">counsellor</span> seems to be inherent in the word cohen or <span class="accented">priest</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Ten shekels</span> - a little over a pound of our money, but probably equivalent to &pound;20, when considered relatively to articles of consumption. <span class="cmt_word">A suit of apparel</span>. There is great doubt as to the exact meaning of the word rendered <span class="accented">suit</span> in this connection. The word means anything <span class="accented">arranged</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> put in a <span class="accented">rank</span>, or <span class="accented">row</span>, or <span class="accented">order.</span> In <a href="../../par/exodus/40-23.htm">Exodus 40:23</a> it is applied to the shewbread: "He ordered the bread in order." Thence it came to mean the <span class="accented">estimation</span> or <span class="accented">worth</span> of a person or thing - some-what as we use the word <span class="accented">rank.</span> From this last sense some interpret the word here to mean the <span class="accented">worth</span> or <span class="accented">price</span> of his clothes. Others, including St. Jerome and the Septuagint, interpret it <span class="accented">a pair</span> of vestments, meaning summer and winter clothing. But perhaps the A.V., <span class="accented">suit</span>, meaning the whole set of under and upper garments, is after all the best interpretation. <span class="cmt_word">The Levite went in</span>. The Hebrew is <span class="accented">went</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the common use of the word, <span class="accented">went his way.</span> And such is probably the meaning here. He went his way to consider the proposal made to him. The result is given in the next verse: <span class="accented">And the Levite was content</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>

But as long as any part of the tribe was not settled, the tribe as such, in its unity, was still seeking a settlement. The land for their inheritance had not yet fallen to the tribe in its integrity.

The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, and in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> into <span class="accented">Lesem-dan.</span> St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Lesem Dan.</span> Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to.

The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: "And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, '<span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, <span class="accented">and none doing any injury to any one in the land</span>, <span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man." The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word <span class="accented">dwelling</span> is in the feminine gender, agreeing with <span class="accented">people</span>, the words <span class="accented">quiet</span> and <span class="accented">secure</span> and <span class="accented">possessing</span> are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, "dwelling in security," "quiet and secure," and for the poetical character of the phrase "<span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>," and for the unusual form of the word here rendered <span class="accented">wealth</span> (<span class="accented">etzer</span> with an ain, instead of the usual <span class="accented">otzar</span> with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of <span class="accented">wealth</span> from <span class="accented">collecting</span>, from which the common word <span class="accented">atzereth</span> derives its meaning of a <span class="accented">collection</span> or <span class="accented">congregation</span> of people.

Just as <span class="accented">Israel</span> or <span class="accented">Judah</span> designates the whole nation, or the whole tribe, under the name of their patriarch, so here Micah would include all the clan who dwelt in Micah's house; and hence the Danites speak of Micah being gathered together.

It was situated, as we learn from <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>, in the bounds of the tribe of Asher, in the extreme north of the Holy Land, near the entering in of Hamath, the site of which, however, is unknown (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>).

The Hebrew text really has <span class="accented">the son of Moses.</span> But a little <span class="accented">n</span> is written above the line between the M and the S of Moses (Mosheh), so as to be read <span class="accented">Manasseh</span>, as thus: MSH; so that they avoided the pain of reading aloud that the grandson or descendant of Moses was an idolatrous priest, without actually altering the written text. It is indeed most sad that it should have been so, though like examples are not wanting, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the sons of Eli and of Samuel. For Gershom the son of Moses see <a href="../../par/exodus/2-22.htm">Exodus 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-3.htm">Exodus 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-14.htm">1 Chronicles 23:14-16</a>. It does not follow that Jonathan, the priest of the Danites, was literally the son of Gershom. It may merely mean that he was of the family of which Gershom was the head. <span class="cmt_word">Until the day of the captivity of the land</span>. There is great diversity of opinion as to the meaning of this phrase. Many understand it, as is the obvious meaning of the words, of the Assyrian captivity (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). But some of the best commentators, as Kimchi among the Jews, and many moderns, think it refers to the taking captive of the ark by the Philistines in the days of Eli, because this is the time indicated in the next verse by the mention of the house of God in Shiloh. The ark of God never returned to Shiloh after it was taken thence (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>) and captured by the Philistines (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 11). It is also noticed that the expression, <span class="accented">The ark of God is gone into captivity</span> (is <span class="accented">taken</span>, A.V.), occurs in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21, 22</a>. It certainly would be strange that one verse (30) should speak of the worship of the graven image lasting till the Assyrian conquest of the land, and the next verse (31) limit it to the time that the house of God was in Shiloh, some 300 years earlier. At the same time it should be noticed that ver. 30 speaks of the time that Jonathan's sons were priests to the tribe of Dan, and ver. 31 of the worship of Micah's image. It is quite possible that the descendants of Jonathan may have been appointed priests at Dan to Jeroboam's golden-calf worship, though the original graven image of Micah may have been destroyed by Saul or David; and in the interval between such destruction of Micah's image and the setting up of Jeroboam's calves they may have been the priests of an irregular worship on a high place at Tell-el-Kady. And this would enable us to give what is certainly its natural meaning to the words, "the captivity of the land." But no certainty can be arrived at without more actual knowledge. Many commentators adopt Houbigant's conjecture to read <span class="accented">ark</span> for <span class="accented">land</span> at the end of ver. 30 (<span class="accented">aron</span> for <span class="accented">aretz</span>). Others think that some deportation of the Danites by the Syrians or other neighbouring people not recorded in history is here spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">All the time the house of God</span>, etc. This must have been written not earlier than the time of Samuel, and possibly much later. The house of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tabernacle, was in Shiloh from the days of Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>) till the days of Eli (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), after which we have no account of where the house of God was till the ark was brought up to Jerusalem by King David from the house of Obed-edom the Gittite (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-12.htm">2 Samuel 6:12</a>), and placed in the tabernacle that David had pitched for it (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>); but whether this was the tabernacle that had been pitched at Shiloh or a new one does not appear. It is not improbable that Samuel may have moved the tabernacle from Shiloh to Ramah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>). The ark had rested in the house of Abinadab at Baaleh or Kirjath-jearim for twenty years (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>) previous to its removal by David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

It appears from <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27, 28</a> that the events narrated in these three last chapters of the Book of Judges happened in the lifetime of Phinehas, and while the ark was at Shiloh (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). Phinehas evidently outlived Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29, 33</a>), though there is no evidence to show how long. The events in these chapters must have occurred in the interval between the death of Joshua and the death of Phinehas. <span class="cmt_word">A certain Levite</span>, etc. It is a curious coincidence that both the Levite whose sad story is here told, and the Levite the son of Gershom of whom we read in the preceding chapters, were sojourners in the hill country of Ephraim, and also closely connected with Bethlehem-judah. Perhaps the legitimate inference (see ver. 18, and <a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26, 27</a>) is that in both cases the Levites were drawn to Ephraim by the ark being at Shiloh, and also that there was a colony of Levites at Bethlehem-judah. Whether there was any connection between the presence of Levites at Bethlehem and the annual sacrifice at Bethlehem which existed in David's time, and which argues the existence of a high place there, can only be a matter of conjecture (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>, and 1 Samuel 20:29). All we can say is that there was the universal prevalence of high-place worship during the time of the judges, and that the services of Levites were sought after in connection with it (<a href="../../par/judges/17-13.htm">Judges 17:13</a>). On the side. Hebrew, sides. In the masculine form the word means the hip and upper part of the thigh; in the feminine, as here, it is applied only to inanimate objects, as a house, the temple, a cave, the north, a pit, a country, etc., and is used in the dual number (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/128-3.htm">Psalm 128:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a>, etc.). It means the innermost, hindmost, furthermost parts.

But there is nothing in the expression implying any excess in drinking. <span class="cmt_word">Bring forth the man</span>. The abandoned character of the men appears in this, that not only did they offer no hospitality to the stranger themselves, but were ready to violate the sanctity of the hospitality of the old man's house by their brutal violence. There must have been a fearful absence of all law and order and government when such deeds could be done without any interference on the part of magistrate or elder or ruler of any kind. The singular resemblance of the whole narrative to that in <a href="../../par/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. suggests that the Israelites by their contact with the accursed Canaanites had reduced themselves to the level of Sodom and Gomorrah.

A very interesting account of the Prince of Wales's visit to the Mosque of Hebron in 1862 is given in Dean Stanley s 'Sermons in the East.' David reigned in Hebron seven years and six mouths before he transferred the seat of power to Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>, etc.; 2 Samuel 5:1-5).

The Septuagint reads, "Othniel urged her to ask the field of her father," and the Vulgate has, "Her husband told her to ask her father," and then it follows naturally, "and she lighted from off her ass," etc. But the Hebrew reading may be right, and it may be that when her husband, brave in storming a city, but timid in asking a favour, hung back, she, with the tenacious will of a woman, sprang off the ass herself, and successfully preferred her request. Dean Stanley identifies (though not with absolute certainty) the "field thus obtained by Achsah with an unusually green valley amidst the dry, barren hills of the south country, lying south or west of Hebron, called Wady Nuukur, through which Caleb and Achsah must have ridden on their way from Hebron to Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This valley breaks into a precipitous and still greener ravine, and both the upper and lower pastures are watered by a clear, bubbling rivulet, which rises in the upper meadow, and flows to the bottom of the ravine below. The name of a village, <span class="accented">Dewir</span>, seems to represent the ancient <span class="accented">Debir.</span>

David's numbering gave of Israel 800,000, and of Judah 500,000, in all 1,300,000; but these were not assembled together, but numbered at their own homes. Jehoshaphat's men of war amounted to 1,160,000 according to <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-18</a>.

The words <span class="accented">we will go up</span> are not in the Hebrew, but are supplied by the Septuagint, who very likely found in their Hebrew copy the word <span class="accented">na'aleh</span>, we will go up, which has since (perchance) fallen out of the Hebrew text from its resemblance to the following word '<span class="accented">aleha</span> against it. The sense will then be, Not one of us will shrink from the dangers of the war; but we will cast lots who shall go up against Gibeah, and who shall be employed in collecting victuals for the army, 40,000 having to be told off for the latter service. And exactly in the same spirit (if indeed the answer was not actually given by lot) they inquired of the Lord who should go up first (in ver. 18), and, we may presume also, who should follow in the subsequent attacks, though this is omitted for brevity. Others, however, think the words <span class="accented">against it by lot</span> are purposely abrupt, and that the meaning is that Israel would deal with Gibeah as they had done with the Canaanites, viz., destroy their city, and divide its territory by lot among the other tribes, after the analogy of <a href="../../par/joshua/18-8.htm">Joshua 18:8-10</a>.

We must suppose the message to have preceded in point of time the hostile gathering recorded in ver. 11. It was probably sent before the council broke up (see above, <a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>, and note).

It is impossible to account with certainty for the falling off in the numbers by so many as near 20,000; but perhaps many were slain in the wars of Canaan, and the unsettled times were unfavourable to early marriages. For the whole of Israel there was, as appeared by ver. 2, note, a falling off of nearly 200,000 men, or, to speak exactly (601,730-400,000 +26,700), of 175,030. <span class="cmt_word">Which were numbered</span>. There is some obscurity in this latter clause; but, in spite of the accents being opposed to it, the A.V. seems certainly right. The rendering acording to the accents, "they (the Benjamites) were numbered, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, seven hundred chosen men," makes no sense, and does not explain who the 700 were. The population of Gibeah would be about 5 &times; 700, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 3500, according to this statement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a></div><div class="verse">Among all this people <i>there were</i> seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair <i>breadth</i>, and not miss.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven hundred...  men left-handed</span>. It is curious that the tribe of Benjamin, which means <span class="accented">son of the right hand</span>, should have this peculiar institution of a corps of left-handed men. Ehud the Benjamite was <span class="accented">a man left-handed</span> (<a href="../../par/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The Roman name <span class="accented">Scaexola</span> means <span class="accented">left-handed.</span> For the use of the sling see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40, 49</a>. Diodorus Siculus (quoted by Rosenmuller) mentions the remarkable skill of the inhabitants of the Balearic Islands in the use of the sling, adding, in terms very similar to those of the text, that they seldom miss their aim.

The conclusion is that at this time the ark of God, with the tabernacle, was at Bethel, which was only seven or eight miles from Shiloh. Bethel would be eight or ten miles from Gibeah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about half way between Shiloh and Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Asked counsel</span>. The same phrase as <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, where it is rendered simply asked (see note to <a href="../../par/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>, and vers. 23, 47). In following this precedent the Israelites put the men of Gibeah on the footing of the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. With reference to ver. 9, it is worth considering whether this is not the fulfilment of the purpose there expressed by the Israelites, to go up against Gibeah <span class="accented">by lot</span>; either by understanding that the answer asked was given by a Divinely-directed <span class="accented">lot</span>, according to which Judah's turn came first (see <a href="../../par/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14-18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-24.htm">Acts 1:24-26</a>; etc.), or by taking the expression <span class="accented">by lot</span> in a wider sense, as meaning generally Divine direction.

Neither, again, is the explanation of some commentators, that the words <span class="accented">the ark</span>...  <span class="accented">was there in those days</span> implies "that the ark of the covenant was only temporarily at Bethel," at all satisfactory. <span class="accented">In those days</span> has naturally a much wider and broader application, like the expression (<a href="../../par/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1</a>), In <span class="accented">those days there was no king in Israel</span>, and contrasts the time of Phinehas and the judges with the times of the monarchy, when the ark and the high priest were at Jerusalem. Unless, therefore, we understand Bethel in vers. 18, 26, 31 to mean the house of God, which seems quite impossible, we must interpret the word <span class="accented">there</span> to mean Shiloh, and suppose that the writer took no count of the temporary removal to Bethel for the convenience of consultation, but considered that it was at Shiloh in one sense, though momentarily it was a few miles off. Possibly too in the fuller narrative, of which we have here the abridgment, the name of Shiloh was mentioned as that to which there referred.

Here manifestly <span class="accented">Bethel</span>, as in the margin. <span class="cmt_word">Gibeah in the field</span>. The A.V. is the natural rendering of the Hebrew words, which imply a <span class="accented">Gibeah in the field</span> different from <span class="accented">Gibeah</span>, as the Septuagint seems to have understood them (<span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>). It is a happy conjecture, borne out by the existing roads, that this Gibeah-in-the-field is the same as <span class="accented">Gobs</span>, now <span class="accented">Jeba.</span> Indeed it is almost impossible to conceive how the pursuers, coming out of Gibeah, could be described as coming to two highways, of which one led to Bethel and the other to the very place they had come from. The latest explorers of the district fully concur in this identification of Gibeah-in-the-field with Jeba. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-32.htm">Judges 20:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Benjamin said, They <i>are</i> smitten down before us, as at the first.

The Benjamites pursued recklessly, because they thought the fight was going as on the two previous days; the Israelites fled in order to draw them to the highways, and so to enable the ambushment to get between the Benjamite army and the city. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-33.htm">Judges 20:33</a></div><div class="verse">And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, <i>even</i> out of the meadows of Gibeah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Rose up out of their place</span>. The narrative is singularly obscure and broken, and difficult to follow. But the meaning seems to be, that when the Israelite army had reached Baal-tamar in their flight, they suddenly stopped and formed to give battle to the pursuing Benjamites. And at the same time the liers in wait came out from their ambushment and placed themselves in the rear of the Benjamites on the direct road to Gibeah. <span class="cmt_word">Baal</span>-<span class="cmt_word">tamar</span>, a place of palm trees. The site has not been identified, but may possibly, or probably, be the same as the palm tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel (<a href="../../par/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The meadows of Gibeah</span>, Hebrew, <span class="accented">Maareh-Geba</span>, may very likely have been, as the Septuagint takes it, a proper name, denoting some locality outside Gibeah (here called Geba) where the ambush was concealed. The meaning of the word <span class="accented">maareh</span> is thought to be a bare tract of ground without trees - something like a heath or common. It may have had pits, or deep depressions, where the ambush would be hid both from the city itself and from the high road, or other facilities for concealment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-34.htm">Judges 20:34</a></div><div class="verse">And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil <i>was</i> near them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Against Gibeah</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against the army of Gibeah. The sense seems to be that the 10,000 Israelites who had been fleeing before Benjamin, and drawing them away from the city, now faced them, and commenced a resolute attack upon them, which at first the Benjamites, not knowing of the ambushment in their rear met with equal resolution, so that "the battle was sore." But the result, the details of which are given at length in vers. 36-46, was that 25,100 Benjamites fell that day (see ver. 46). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-36.htm">Judges 20:36</a></div><div class="verse">So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 36-41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten</span>. Not of course after 25,000 of them had been smitten, but at that period of the battle more fully described in vers. 40, 41, when the Benjamites, looking behind them, saw Gibeah in flames, and immediately broke and fled towards the wilderness. In the latter half of this verse and in the following verses to ver. 41 the writer recapitulates all the preceding circumstances, some of which have been already mentioned, which led to the particular incident mentioned in the beginning of the verse, that "Benjamin saw that they were smitten;" viz., the feigned flight of the Israelites, the seizing and burning of Gibeah by the liers in wait, the signal of a great smoke, and the turning again of the flying Israelites. It was then that "the men of Benjamin saw that evil was come upon them," and turned their backs and fled. Thus vers. 36 (latter half)-41 bring us back through the details to the identical point already reached at the beginning of ver. 36. In vers. 39, 40 there is another retrograde movement in the narrative, in which the statement of vers. 31, 32 is repeated in order to bring into close juxtaposition Benjamin's keen pursuit of the enemy with his terror when he saw the smoke rising in his rear. <span class="cmt_word">Hasted</span> (ver. 37). This is an amplification with further particulars of ver. 33. The liers in wait not only came forth out of their place, but they made a dash to get into Gibeah before the men of Gibeah, who were pursuing the flying Israelites, could be aware of their intention. <span class="cmt_word">Rushed upon</span>. Perhaps better rendered <span class="accented">fell upon</span>. It is exactly the same phrase as 2 Samuel 27:8, there rather tamely rendered in<span class="accented">vaded</span> and in ver. 10 <span class="accented">made a road</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Drew themselves</span> <span class="cmt_word">along</span>. Some take the word in the common sense of <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>, but it rather <span class="accented">means</span> spread <span class="accented">themselves out</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7a;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.) through the defenceless city, so as to slay and burn in all parts simultaneously. <span class="cmt_word">That they should make a great flame with smoke,</span> etc. (ver. 38). The Hebrew of this verse is difficult to construe, but the A.V. gives substantially the right sense. They seem to be the very orders given to the leader of the ambush. "Make them (the ambush) multiply to send up (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> send up in great quantities) the column of smoke from the city." It seems that the appearance of the smoke was the signal for the Israelites to turn (ver. 41). <span class="cmt_word">The flame</span>, etc. (ver. 40). Rather, <span class="accented">the column began to go up in</span> (or as) <span class="accented">a pillar of smoke. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The flame of the city</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">the whole of the city</span>, meaning of course the whole city in flames.

The result of the Benjamites finding themselves between the ambushment and the army of Israel was that they took to flight in an easterly direction (ver. 43) toward the wilderness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the wilderness described in <a href="../../par/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a> as "the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout Mount Bethel," where the direction of the wilderness relative to Ephraim is also described as being "on the east." In like manner Zedekiah fled towards the plain (<span class="accented">arabah</span>) or plains of Jericho - a term nearly synonymous with <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Them which came out of the cities</span>, etc. This is a very obscure passage, and is very variously explained. <span class="accented">Those which came out</span> of <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">cities</span> must be the same as are so described in ver. 15, and designates the Benjamites who were not inhabitants of Gibeah. The simplest way, therefore, to understand the passage is to render it without reference to the accents: "And the battle overtook him and those that were from the cities (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the men of Gibeah and the rest of the Benjamites), destroying him (the whole Benjamite army) in the midst of him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> going right into the midst of them, and destroying right and left. Some, however, render it <span class="accented">in the midst of it</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the wilderness. The plural participle <span class="accented">destroying</span> agrees with the singular noun of multitude, <span class="accented">the battle</span> or <span class="accented">war</span>, meaning <span class="accented">all the men of war.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Thus</i> they inclosed the Benjamites round about, <i>and</i> chased them, <i>and</i> trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus they inclosed</span>, etc. Another difficult passage, having all the appearance of being a quotation from some poetical description of the battle. The tenses of the verbs and the absence of any conjunctions in the Hebrew makes the diction like that of <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. The italic words <span class="accented">thus</span> and the two ands ought to be omitted, to give the stately march of the original. "They inclosed, etc.; they chased them; they trod them down," etc. <span class="accented">They inclosed</span> seems to refer to the stratagem by which the Benjamites were <span class="accented">surrounded</span> by the ambush in their rear and the Israelites in front. Then came the pursuit - "they chased them;" then the massacre - "they trod them down." The three verbs describe the three stages of the battle. <span class="cmt_word">With ease</span>. It does not seem possible that the Hebrew word <span class="accented">menuchah</span> can have this meaning. It means sometimes a <span class="accented">place of rest</span>, and sometimes <span class="accented">a state of rest.</span> Taking the latter meaning, the words <span class="accented">they trod them into rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">they quieted them by crushing them to death under their</span> feet, or <span class="accented">in rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">unresisting.</span> Some render it <span class="accented">unto Menuchah</span>, as if <span class="accented">Menuchah</span> was the name of a place, or <span class="accented">from Nochah</span>, as the Septuagint does. Others, <span class="accented">at the place of rest</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at every place where they halted to rest the enemy was upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/20-44.htm">Judges 20:44</a></div><div class="verse">And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these <i>were</i> men of valour.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there fell</span>, etc. The account in ver. 35, anticipating the details of the battle, had already given the gross number of casualties in the Benjamite army on this disastrous day as 25,100. We now have the items of the account, viz., 18,000 in the pursuit, in the open plain; 5000 in the highways, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either the highways mentioned in ver. 31, or, as the expression <span class="accented">gleaning</span> rather intimates, the highways by which straggling bodies tried to reach any neighbouring cities after the great slaughter had taken place; and 2000 more who were making from Gidom; in all 25,000, which is only 100 men short of the reckoning in ver. 35. <span class="cmt_word">The rock of Rimmon</span>.

If these 600 survivors are added to the 25,000, or 25,100, enumerated as slain (vers. '35, 44), it gives a total of 25,700. But the total number of Benjamites, as given in ver. 15, was 26,700. There remain, therefore, 1000 men unaccounted for. These may, have been killed partly in the two first days successful battles (vers. 21, 25), and partly in the different cities into which they had escaped, when the general massacre recorded in ver. 48 took place. <span class="cmt_word">The rock Rimmon</span>. There are two proposed identifications of this place. One makes it the same as <span class="accented">Rummon</span>, "a village perched on the summit of a conical chalky hill," "rising on the south side to a height of several hundred feet from the Wady Muti-yah," and defended on the west side "by a cross valley of great depth," which lies three miles east of Bethel, and seven miles northeast of Gibeah (Tulell el-Ful), and is situated in the wilderness between the highlands of Benjamin and the Jordan. This is advocated by Robinson ('Biblical Researches,' 1:440), by Mr. Grove in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and by Lt. Conder ('Quart. State. for July 1880,' P. 173). The other is advocated by Mr. W. F. Birch ('Pal. Expl., Quart. State. for April 1880'). This identifies it with the <span class="accented">Wady er-Rummon</span>, discovered by Mr. Rawnsley, where there is a vast cave, <span class="accented">Mugharet el Jai</span>, about a mile and a half from Geba, capable, according to the local tradition, of holding 600 men, and used to the present day by the villagers as a place of refuge from the government persecutions According to this view, the statement that they abode in the rock Rimmon is strictly correct.

The passage is difficult to construe and to explain.

Compare the exactly similar description, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3, 7</a>. There is a great difference of opinion among commentators as to what feast is here meant. Hengstenberg, Keil, Delitzsch, and others think it was the passover; Bishop Patrick and others think it was the feast of tabernacles, a more joyous feast; Rosenmuller and others think it was a festival peculiar to Shiloh, after the analogy of the yearly sacrifice of the family of Jesse at Bethlehem (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/20-29.htm">1 Samuel 20:29</a>), and more or less in accordance with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-12</a>. It is not easy to say which view is right, but the last seems not improbable, <span class="cmt_word">In a place which is on the north side</span>, etc. The words <span class="accented">in a place</span> are not in the Hebrew, and do not seem to be implied by the context. But the description is that of the situation of Shiloh itself, which is very exact (see 'Palestine Exploration Fund,' Map of West Palestine). <span class="cmt_word">Lebonah</span> survives in el-Lubbun, about two miles north-west of Seilun, and to the west of the road to Shechem or Nablus. It seems strange that so particular a description of the situation of Shiloh should be given; but it may probably indicate that the writer lived after the tabernacle had been moved to Jerusalem, and Shiloh had relapsed into an obscure village (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-27.htm">Judges 20:27</a>, note). The situation of the descriptive words in the Hebrew, with the pronoun <span class="accented">which</span>, separated from <span class="accented">Shiloh</span> by the word <span class="accented">yearly</span>, indicates that they are an explanation added by the narrator.

The verb is in the masculine gender, though <span class="accented">the daughters of Shiloh</span> is the subject (see above, ver. 12, note), To dance in dances. Bishop Patrick says that the feast of tabernacles was the only feast at which Jewish maidens were permitted to dance. Go to the land of Benjamin. The close vicinity of the high road leading from Shechem to Bethel on the border of Benjamin would facilitate their flight. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/21-22.htm">Judges 21:22</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, <i>that</i> ye should be guilty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Be favourable unto them for our sakes</span>.

If we may insert the word to, as the A.V. does, before <span class="accented">each</span> <span class="accented">man</span> (for it is wanting in the Hebrew), the sense is good. The Israelites acknowledge their own fault in not reserving women enough to be wives to the Benjamites, and ask the fathers and brothers of the daughters of Shiloh to do them a favour by enabling them to repair their fault. But it is rather a strain upon the words. The omission of the <span class="accented">to</span> is not natural in such a phrase (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a> is hardly to the point, nor is <a href="../../par/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>, where the <span class="accented">to</span> had been expressed before the us), and <span class="accented">reserved</span> is a forced interpretation of the verb. If the words were spoken by the Benjamites, all would be plain and easy: "We received not each man his wife in the war." Hence some put the speech into the mouth of Benjamin, as though the Israelites meant, We will say in your names, in your persons, as your attorneys, so to speak, "Grant them to us," etc. But this is rather forced. Others, therefore, follow the Peschito, and read, "<span class="accented">because</span> THEY received not each man his wife," etc., which makes very good sense, but has not MS. authority. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did not give</span>, etc., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you need not fear the guilt of the broken oath, because you did not <span class="accented">give</span> your daughters, so as to violate the oath (ver. 7), but they were taken from you by force.

There are two theories in regard to Hamath. Some, as Professor Rawlinson in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' identify it with <span class="accented">Hamah</span>, a large and important city on the Orontes in Upper Syria, and consider <span class="accented">that</span> the kingdom of Hamath, which was overthrown by the king of Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-34.htm">2 Kings 18:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-13.htm">2 Kings 19:13</a>), and of which Hamath was the capital, was for the most part an independent Hamitic or Canaanite kingdom (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), but occasionally, as in the days of Solomon and Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>), subject to Israel Others, however, justly considering the great improbability of the Israelite dominion having ever extended so far north as the valley of the Orontes, and observing how it is spoken of as an integral part of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>), look for Hamath much further south, in the neighbourhood of Beth-rehob (see <a href="../../par/judges/18-28.htm">Judges 18:28</a>, note). As regards the phrase "the entering in of Hamath," the identical Hebrew words occur seven times, viz., <a href="../../par/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; in this passage; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>, and are variously rendered in the A.V.: "as men come to Hamath;" "unto the entrance of Hamath;" "the entering into Hamath;" "the entering in of Hamath (three times); and the entering of Hamath." The exact meaning of  the phrase seems to be "the approach to  Hamath," some particular spot in the valley  from whence the direct road to Hamath begins; very much like the railway term for  certain stations which are the nearest to,  though at some little distance from, the  place from which they are named, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>,  Shapwick Road, Mildenhall Road, etc. The latter words of the verse describe the territory of the Hivites, which reached from Mount Baal-hermon in the Lebanon range as far as the point where the road leads to Hamath.

The whole book proceeds on the same model as this section does.

Hebrew, <span class="accented">Saviour</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> ver. 15 (see <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-27.htm">Nehemiah 9:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Othniel</span>, etc. Mentioned <a href="../../par/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-13.htm">1 Chronicles 4:13</a>, where he is placed under "the sons of Kenaz," and seems to be the father of Hathath and Meonothai. According to Judith 6:15, he had a descendant, <span class="accented">Chabris</span>, living in the time of Holofernes. The Hebrew, though grammatically it favours the view that Othniel was the brother of Caleb, does not absolutely exclude the rendering that Kenaz was his brother, and so Othniel his nephew. Compare <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7</a>, where the words "thine uncle" apply to Shallum, not to Hanameel, as is clear from ver. 8. And as the chronology seems to make it impossible that Othniel should be Caleb's brother, since Caleb was eighty-five years old at the time of Othniel's marriage, and Othniel therefore could not be less than fifty-five, an improbable age for his marriage; and since, again, Othniel could not well have been less than eighty at Joshua's death, which, allowing only ten years for the elders, and reckoning the eight years for Chushan's dominion, would make him ninety-eight when he was raised up to deliver Israel, it is a lesser difficulty to take Othniel as the nephew of Caleb, by understanding the words, <span class="accented">Caleb's younger brother</span>, to apply to Kenaz. But perhaps the least objectionable escape from the difficulty is to take the phrase in its most natural grammatical sense, but to understand the word <span class="accented">brother</span> in its wider and very common sense of <span class="accented">kinsman</span> or <span class="accented">fellow-tribesman.</span> They were both sons of Kenaz, or Kenizzites. Caleb was the head of the tribe, and Othniel was next to him in tribal dignity, and his junior in age, but probably succeeded to the chieftainship on Caleb's death. This would leave the exact relationship between Caleb and Othniel uncertain.

A left-handed man wearing no sword or dagger on his left side, and using his right hand for other purposes, would naturally throw a man off his guard.

They could neither escape into Moab nor get help from Moab.

It is a little surprising, therefore, to read here of another Jabin reigning in Hazor, with confederate kings under him (<a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), having, like his predecessor, a vast number of chariots (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3, 13</a> with <a href="../../par/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4, 9</a>), and attacking Israel at the head of a great force (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7, 13, 16</a> with <a href="../../par/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>).

We first find this term in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-1.htm">Genesis 29:1</a>, where it is applied to the people of Haran. Comparing the analogous phrases, "the east country" (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-6.htm">Genesis 25:6</a>), the mountains of the east (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-7.htm">Numbers 23:7</a>), "the men of the east" (<a href="../../par/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>), "the east" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>), we gather that the country lying to the east of Palestine as far as the river Euphrates was called the east country, and that the various tribes of Arabs and others who peopled that desert were called "the children of the cast" (see ver. 33 and <a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-10.htm">Judges 8:10</a>).

Observe the simple way in which the ministration of the angel is introduced, as if it were a matter of course in the eyes of him who is the Lord of the millions of the heavenly host, those ministers of his who do his pleasure.

As regards what follows, there are two ways of understanding the verse. One, that of the A.V., supposes that only one bullock is spoken of, and that "<span class="accented">the</span> young bullock" belonging to Joash is further described as "even the second bullock of seven years old;" to which it is objected that a bullock of seven years old is not "a young bullock," "the bullock of an <span class="accented">ox</span>," as the Hebrew phrase is, and that there is no explanation of the meaning of "the second bullock;" and that the Hebrew manifestly describes two bullocks: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Joash's young bullock, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the bullock of seven years old. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The other supposes two bullocks, and instead of has the more natural rendering and. The only objection to this, by far the most natural rendering, is that Gideon is not told what to do with the first bullock. But it is a simple explanation that the two bullocks were used in the laborious work of demolishing the altar of Baal, and removing the earth and the stone to build the altar of the Lord, and that when the work was finished one of the bullocks - the seven-year-old - was sacrificed. <span class="cmt_word">For the grove</span> see <a href="../../par/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>, note.

The great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon (which is the Greek form of the name), through which the Kishon flows, is eight hours in length from east to west, and five hours (twelve miles) in breadth from north to south. It is described as "a very extensive and fertile plain shut in between the mountain ranges of Samaria and Mount Carmel on the south, and of Galilee on the north," and extending from the Mediterranean at the Gulf of <span class="accented">Caipha</span>, or <span class="accented">Haipha</span>, to the valley of the Jordan. The access to it from the fords of Jordan in the neighbourhood of Bethshan (or <span class="accented">Beishan</span>, called by the Greeks <span class="accented">Scythopolis</span>) made it the natural place for invasion by the wild tribes east of Jordan, as it is to this day.

So they did now, but they met with a different reception this time.

The same principles which run through the choice of God s instruments on other occasions appear here. The instruments are to be such in quality or in quantity as to make it quite manifest that the excellency of the power is God's, not man's; and yet the instruments themselves are to be conspicuous for their rare excellence. The shepherd boy who sat on the throne of Israel was manifestly made to sit on that throne by the appointment of God; but what a ruler, what a noble character David was! It has always been deemed one of the proofs of the Divine origin of Christianity that its apostles were men of such humble station, and yet were able to change the whole religion and morality of the world; and yet what noble stuff Peter and John and Paul were made of! And so here the overthrow of the hosts of Midian by three hundred Israelites was manifestly the effect of the power of God fighting on their behalf. But yet what marvellous heroism was there in those three hundred! what strength of purpose, what iron-firmness of nerve, to see above thirty thousand of their comrades leave them in the face of the myriads of their foes; to remain quietly at their post, and, when the time came, to leave their camp and pour down into the plain. Their self-possession and self-restraint and absence of self-indulgence in the matter of the water was a true index of the unequalled qualities which they displayed in the sequel. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the people took</span>, etc. It is almost certain that the passage ought to be rendered, "And they took the victuals of the people in their hands, and their trumpets," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the three hundred took or borrowed what provisions they needed for a few days, and the trumpets, which were to play an important part in the stratagem, from the people who were about to return to their homes. <span class="cmt_word">And the host of Midian</span>, etc. The writer repeats this to give a perfect picture of the situation. The whole army returned to their homes; the three hundred alone with Gideon in the camp; the Midianite host in the plain beneath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 7:9-25

These fighting men, as distinguished from the numbers of the nomads who were with their camels and cattle scattered all along the plain, were all collected in the camp, to the edge of which Gideon and Phurah crept stealthily in the dark.

The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else. <span class="cmt_word">Of barley bread</span>. The commonest kind of bread, the food of only the poorer classes, indicating, therefore, the humble origin and station of Gideon. <span class="cmt_word">A tent</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">the tent</span>; what in a Roman camp would be the <span class="accented">pretorium</span>, the general's tent. The words at the end of the verse are heaped up to indicate the total and entire upsetting and overthrow of the tent, symbolic of the rout and destruction of the Midianite host. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/7-14.htm">Judges 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">And his fellow answered and said, This <i>is</i> nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: <i>for</i> into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is nothing else</span>, etc. The dream and the interpretation are striking evidences of the terror which Gideon's name had already inspired among the Midianites. Because, although both the dream and the interpretation were of God, for the encouragement of Gideon in his great undertaking, yet they followed the course of nature and the laws of psychology. The presentiment that God had delivered Midian into Gideon's hand is exactly like the terror in the minds of the Canaanites which preceded the arrival of Joshua (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>).

He not only learnt the state of panic in which the Midianites were, but he had a further certainty that God was with him. His simple piety and adoring gratitude threw him at once upon his knees to thank God, and to cast himself anew upon his strength with un-doubting trust. His hands were indeed strengthened, and he lost not a moment in returning to his 300, relating in a few words the incident of the dream, and bidding them follow him. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord hath delivered</span>, etc. Cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a></div><div class="verse">And he divided the three hundred men <i>into</i> three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Trumpets</span>, which had been collected from the whole army (ver. 8, note). <span class="cmt_word">Lamps</span>. Rather, as in the margin, <span class="accented">torches</span>, within the pitchers, so as not to be seen till the pitchers were broken, when the torches would flare with a sudden blaze. The <span class="accented">pitchers</span> were vessels for drawing water, as appears from <a href="../../par/genesis/24-14.htm">Genesis 24:14, 16, 18, 20</a>.

It has either dropped out of the text accidentally, or what we have here is the shorter form of the war-cry. It is observable how careful Gideon is to put the name of Jehovah first. It was his cause against Baal, and the battle was to be fought in his strength, and the glory of the victory was to be his. The cry, "The sword of Gideon," would be peculiarly terrible to the many who had heard of the dream, of which the fulfilment was come so quickly. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19</a></div><div class="verse">So Gideon, and the hundred men that <i>were</i> with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that <i>were</i> in their hands.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The middle watch</span>. The ancient Israelites divided the night into three watches of four hours each, from sunset to sunrise, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from six p.m. to six a.m. The first watch, from six to ten, is not mentioned in the Old Testament; but we have the <span class="accented">middle</span> watch mentioned here (from ten to two), and the <span class="accented">morning watch</span> (from two till six): <a href="../../par/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>. According to this, Gideon's attack would have taken place soon after ten p.m., or towards eleven, the time when the sleep would be the deepest, the watchmen of the first watch having lately fallen into their first sleep. The later Israelites adopted the Roman division of the night into four watches (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-25.htm">Matthew 14:25</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/luke/12-38.htm">Luke 12:38</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-35.htm">Mark 13:35</a>).

This had the effect of awakening the whole camp simultaneously, and they started to their feet and ran hither and thither in confusion, shouting as they went. Undisciplined troops, especially excitable Orientals, are very liable to be thus thrown into a panic. <span class="cmt_word">Fled</span>. The Cethib has, caused to <span class="accented">fly</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> either "put to flight," or "carried away," as in <a href="../../par/judges/6-9.htm">Judges 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/9-20.htm">Exodus 9:20</a>. In the former case the nominative must be <span class="accented">the Israelites</span>; in the latter, <span class="accented">their tents</span>, <span class="accented">herds</span>, <span class="accented">stuff</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span>, must be understood. Both are very awkward. The Keri, fled, is probably right, unless caused <span class="accented">to fly</span> has the sense of "bid them fly," in which case the preceding word, <span class="accented">cried</span>, might be taken in its common sense of <span class="accented">they sounded an alarm.</span> The whole clause would then run thus: <span class="accented">And all the camp ran</span>; <span class="accented">and they sounded a retreat</span>, <span class="accented">and bid them flee.</span>

The Midianites, thinking the enemy were upon them, and not being able in the dark to distinguish friend from foe, mistook their flying comrades for pursuing Israelites, and fell upon and slew one another. In like manner the Philistines had done when attacked by Jonathan and his armour-bearer (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-20.htm">1 Samuel 14:20</a>), and the Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites when attacked by Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shittah</span>. House of acacias. The exact situation of it, and of Zererath and Tabbath, is unknown. They must have been villages lying on the route from the plain of Esdraelon to the banks of Jordan, probably between Little Hermon on the north and Mount Gilboa on the south, where there was a very ancient high road from Jezreel to the Jordan by Beth-sham Indeed it is highly probable that <span class="accented">Shuta</span>, a village mentioned by Robinson, marks the site, as it retains the name of Beth-shittah. For <span class="cmt_word">Zererath</span> some read, with some of the old versions and manuscripts, <span class="accented">Zeredath</span> (<span class="accented">r</span> and <span class="accented">d</span> being scarcely distinguishable in Hebrew), and identify it with <span class="accented">Zarthan</span> near Succoth, mentioned <a href="../../par/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a> and <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Abel-meholah</span> (the meadow of the dance) was the birthplace of Elisha (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), and is mentioned in conjunction with Beth-shan, Jezreel, and Zartana in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>.

The <span class="accented">waters</span> seem to mean a number of streams running from the hill country of Ephraim into the Jordan, and which had to be crossed by the Midianites before they could reach the Jordan fords. The site of <span class="accented">Beth-barah</span> is unknown. It is not thought to be the same as <span class="accented">Bethabara beyond Jordan</span>, where John was baptising (<a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>). <span class="accented">Beth-barah</span> must have been on the west of Jordan.

It is possible that the transfer of the birthright from Manasseh to Ephraim (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-19</a>) may have produced some estrangement between the tribes. It is also possible that Ephraim, in view of their great tribal power, and the distinction conferred upon them by the judgeship of Joshua the son of Nun (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>), and the possession of his grave (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>), may have grown haughty and domineering, and perhaps more disposed to rest upon their former glories than to embark in fresh undertakings. Anyhow Gideon did not consult them, nor ask their aid, in the first instance. Now that the war had been so successful, the men of Ephraim were much displeased at not having been consulted.

Humble and unassuming (<a href="../../par/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15, 36</a>, note), and indisposed to glory, he was willing to give the Ephraimites full credit for their share in the great victory; prudent, and a lover of his country, he saw the immense importance of union among themselves, and the danger of intestine divisions and discord, and so at once met Ephraim's taunts by the soft answer which turneth away wrath (<a href="../../par/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The grapes</span>.

In <a href="../../par/joshua/13-27.htm">Joshua 13:27</a> we are also distinctly told that Succoth was in the trans-Jordanic tribe of Gad (which lay south of the Jabbok), in the valley of the Jordan, where its proximity to <span class="accented">Mahanaim</span> (vers. 26, 30) shows it to be the same place as Jacob's <span class="accented">Succoth</span>, which was also near the Jabbok (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>). The identification of Succoth with any modern representative is very uncertain. Jerome mentions a trans-Jordanic place named Soc-<span class="accented">hoth</span>, in the region of Beth-shan, or Scythe-polls; and Burkhardt also mentions a place described by him as "the ruins of Sukkot," two hours from Bysan (Beth-shan), and on the east of Jordan. But this, as well as the <span class="accented">Sakut</span> of Robinson and Van de Velde, on the west of Jordan, about ten miles south of Beth-shan, is too far north for the Suceoth of Jacob, which is shown to be the same as the Succoth of Gideon by the connection of the latter with Penuel (ver. 8), and which, as above noticed, is shown to be the same as the Succoth of <a href="../../par/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13</a>. by its proximity to Mahanaim. We must await some further light before we can decide the exact position of Succoth.

Instead of aiding Gideon in his gallant enterprise for the deliverance of his country, they refused even food to his weary followers, for fear of the possibility of incurring the anger of the Midianites in ease Gideon should fail. Their conduct and that of the men of Penuel is perhaps one among many indications how little real union there was between the tribes on the opposite sides of the Jordan (see <a href="../../par/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16, 17</a>).

The provocation, it must be allowed, was very great, but still the spirit was very different from that which dictated the prayer under far greater provocation, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." Thorns of the wilderness. The nature of the punishment here threatened, and the execution of which is related in ver. 16, is uncertain. The word here rendered tear means literally to thresh,. Hence some suppose that the punishment here spoken of was a severe kind of capital punishment inflicted by threshing instruments with sharp iron points, called here "thorns of the wilderness," and "briers (though some again understand literally <span class="accented">thorns</span> and <span class="accented">briers</span>); and they compare <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>, where the word rendered <span class="accented">harrows</span> means <span class="accented">threshing instruments</span>, as also <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-27.htm">Isaiah 28:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>.

Penuel appears to have been a place of importance, since Jeroboam repaired its fortifications with a view of retaining his hold on trans-Jordanic Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>).

The situation assigned to it by Eusebius and Jerome, as being the same as a castle called Carcaria, near Petra, is quite out of the question, as being greatly too far south. As an appellative it suggests the idea of a walled-in space (<span class="accented">kir</span>   =   a wall; <span class="accented">kir-kir</span>    =    a space walled all round; cf. the Latin <span class="accented">carcer</span>, <span class="accented">a</span> prison); possibly an enclosed sheep or cattle fold on a large scale (see <a href="../../par/numbers/32-36.htm">Numbers 32:36</a>: "built ... folds for sheep"), affording some protection to the Midianite soldiers.

Jogbehah was in the tribe of Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-35.htm">Numbers 32:35</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/8-13.htm">Judges 8:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun <i>was up</i>,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the sun was up</span>. There is a wonderful diversity in the renderings of this verse. Some of the old versions and Jewish Rabbis interpret it <span class="accented">before sunset.</span> Many of the best Jewish commentators, however, understand the phrase as the A.V. does - "Before the going up of the sun," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before sunrise; supposing Gideon's attack on the Midianitish camp to have been a night attack, and Succoth to have been so near to Karkor that he was able to reach it by sunrise. But others say that the word here rendered <span class="accented">sun</span> (<span class="accented">heres</span>) is only used in poetry, and that the word rendered up is never used of sunrise, but, as, in the phrase "the going up of Akrabbim" (<a href="../../par/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>), of an ascent up a hill. They therefore take <span class="accented">heres</span> as a proper name, and translate "from the going up of Hems." Others again, by an almost imperceptible change in the last letter, read "the mountains" instead of <span class="accented">Heres.</span> But the A.V. may be well defended, and gives an excellent sense. In <a href="../../par/judges/14-18.htm">Judges 14:18</a> the same word for the sun is used in the very similar phrase, "before the sun went down." In <a href="../../par/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15</a> the phrase, "the morning arose," has the verb from which the word here rendered <span class="accented">up</span> is derived; and a note of time here exactly suits the context. It marks the celerity of Gideon's move. ments that he was actually on his way back to Succoth at sunrise, after having routed the Midianites and taken their two kings prisoners.

We have then the fulfilment of Gideon's threat in ver. 7 recorded in the same words with regard to Succoth, just as the <span class="accented">breaking down</span> of the tower of Penuel in ver. 17 is in verbal agreement with ver. 9.

We may observe in passing how characteristic this is of a true narrative in which every. thing that happened cannot possibly be related (see <a href="../../par/judges/10-11.htm">Judges 10:11, 12</a>, note). The word here rendered <span class="accented">what manner of</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. of what</span> sort, means, in every other place in which it occurs, where? and the sense <span class="accented">of what sort is</span> only inferred from the answer, <span class="accented">As thou art</span>, <span class="accented">so were they.</span> But it is not safe thus to change the universal meaning of a common word. It is better to take the words of Gideon, <span class="accented">Where are the men whom ye slew</span> at Tabor? as an upbraiding of them for the murder of his brethren, and a threat that where they were their murderers would soon be. The answer of Zebah and Zalmunna, which is not given in its entirety, was no doubt intended to be soothing and deprecatory of Gideon's wrath. They pleaded the necessity they were under in self-defence to slay them; they were men of such royal stature and prowess that their own lives would have been in danger had they spared them. But Gideon turned a deaf ear to their plea. He must avenge the death of his own brothers, his own mother's sons. He would have spared them as prisoners of war (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a>), but he must do his part as <span class="accented">goel</span> or <span class="accented">avenger</span> (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Observe the stress laid on their being not merely his father's sons by another wife, but his own mother's sons, a much more tender relation (cf. Psalm 50:0).

But it is well for us to be made aware how the best and greatest men cannot rise above the manners and received maxims of their age; and it teaches us to make due allowance for the faults of uncivilised men with whom we have to do, whether Afghans, or Zulus, or others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/8-21.htm">Judges 8:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man <i>is, so is</i> his strength.

But the time predicted by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14, 15</a>) was not yet come. And so Gideon returned an answer replete with moderation and piety: "I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule over you" (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>).

Again human weakness breaks out in this great man, and we seem to see the effect of great prosperity in stirring up selfish desires in his heart. It was perhaps not without significance that mention was made in ver. 21 of his taking the ornaments that were on the camels' necks in connection with the slaughter of the kings. Anyhow we have now a second instance of a love of spoil. It seems to have been a national custom with the Ishmaelites, among whom the Midianites are reckoned (see <a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25-28</a>), to wear golden rings; hence when they came to strip the slain there was a vast booty of gold rings. These Gideon asked for as his share, and the people readily agreed to the request. <span class="cmt_word">Ear-rings</span>. The word is singular in Hebrew, which agrees with its more proper signification of <span class="accented">nose-ring</span>, an ornament often worn by both men and women in the East. Gesenius mentions having seen at Leipsic some Indian dancing women with nose-rings. It is distinctly marked as a nose-ring in <a href="../../par/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22, 30, 47</a>, because in the last verse Abraham's servant says that he "<span class="accented">put</span> <span class="accented">the ring</span> (<span class="accented">han-nezem</span>) <span class="accented">upon her nose"</span> (<span class="accented">face</span>, A.V.). Again, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-12.htm">Ezekiel 16:12</a> the Hebrew is, "I <span class="accented">placed a ring upon thy nose"</span> (I put a jewel upon thy forehead, A.V.). So also <a href="../../par/job/42-11.htm">Job 42:11</a>, "<span class="accented">one</span> <span class="accented">ring of gold</span>," implies that it was a nose-ring, and not an ear-ring. In other passages, however, as <a href="../../par/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>, it is expressly said that these rings were worn in the ears; while in others, again, there is nothing to mark whether they were worn in the ears or in the nose, as <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-13.htm">Hosea 2:13</a>, except that in the latter passage the singular number in the Hebrew is more favourable to the <span class="accented">nose-ring</span> than to the <span class="accented">ear-rings</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the A.V. translates it. It is thought by many, with some probability, that the nose-ring did not pierce the gristle of the nose, but hung down upon the nose from a fillet round the forehead. In every case they were of gold.

Perhaps the <span class="accented">ornaments</span> mentioned in ver. 21 as on the camels' necks were suspended to these chains. In <a href="../../par/songs/4-9.htm">Song of Solomon 4:9</a> the <span class="accented">chain</span> is mentioned as an ornament of a woman's neck; in <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-9.htm">Proverbs 1:9</a> of a man's neck. Many interpreters understand these last-mentioned articles as not being part of Gideon's spoil, but being the people's portion. But it seems much more probable that the spoil of the kings should be Gideon's portion, as indeed ver. 21 implies. It is best, therefore, to take all these articles as being the property of the kings, and to understand the writer to tell us that Gideon had the rings, which were the people's spoil, in addition to all the spoil which naturally fell to his own share. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/8-27.htm">Judges 8:27</a></div><div class="verse">And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, <i>even</i> in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gideon made an ephod thereof</span>. There is great difference of opinion among commentators as to the significance of this statement. The ephod (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 6-30</a>) was that part of the high priest's dress (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>) which covered the breast in front, and the upper part of the back behind, the two parts being clasped together by two large onyx stones, one on each shoulder, and kept together by the curious girdle, just above which was fastened the breastplate of judgment. In a modified form the "linen ephod" was worn by all priests; but it was especially worn by the high priest when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>). Hence it was also connected with idolatrous worship, as we see by ch. Judges 17:5, and <a href="../../par/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, being probably used for purposes of divination, as we know that idolatrous kings of Israel, instead of inquiring of the Lord, inquired of the false gods (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2, 3</a>). What, then, was Gideon's purpose in making this costly ephod? We may infer from his proved piety that at all events his intention was to do honour to the Lord, who had given him the victory. Then, as he was now at the head of the State, though he had declined the regal office, and as it was the special prerogative of the head of the State to "inquire of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 28:6, etc.), he may have thought it his right, as well as a matter of great importance to the people, that he should have the means ready at hand of inquiring of God. His relations with the great tribe of Ephraim may have made it inconvenient to go to Shiloh to consult the high priest there, and therefore he would have the ephod at his own city of Ophrah, just as Jephthah made Mizpeh his religious centre (ch. Judges 11:11). Whether he sent for the high priest to come to Ophrah, or whether he made use of the ministry of some other priest, we have no means of deciding. The people, however, always prone to idolatry, made an idol of the ephod, and Gideon, either because it was a source of gain or of dignity to his house, or thinking it was a means of keeping the people from Baal-worship (ver. 33), seems to have connived at it. This seems to be the explanation best supported by the little we know of the circumstances of the case. A snare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as in <a href="../../par/judges/2-3.htm">Judges 2:3</a>, that which leads a person to eventual destruction.

And having lived in wealth and honour, he died in peace, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father at Ophrah in a good old age. He remains to us as one of the most remarkable characters of the Old Testament, not indeed without faults and blemishes, and not wholly unspoiled by prosperity, but still a great man, and an eminent servant of God.

Throughout this chapter Gideon is spoken of by the name of Jerubbaal. There must be some cause for this. The simplest and most probable cause is that this whole history of Abimelech is taken from some other source than the preceding chapters. And a considerable difference in the style of the narrative, which is feebler and more obscure, seems to bear out this inference. <span class="cmt_word">Went to Shechem</span>. This revolt from the house of Gideon in favour of Abimelech seems to partake of the nature of an Ephraimite rising against the supremacy of Manasseh.

And so they seem to have taken advantage of Gideon's death, and of Abimelech's connection with Shechem, to make a league with the Hivite inhabitants of Shechem (see vers. 27, 28) to set up Abimelech as king, and to restore the worship of Baal, under the title of Baal-berith (<a href="../../par/judges/8-33.htm">Judges 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-4.htm">Judges 9:4, 27, 46</a>), at Shechem for all Israel to resort to.

Here, therefore, <span class="accented">the house of Millo</span> probably means the citadel or keep of Sechem, a fortress analogous to the Bala-hissar in relation to Cabul, though possibly at a distance of a mile or two (ver 46, note).

The translation will then be <span class="accented">the oak of the monument</span>, a sense supported by the modern names of the mosque there, of which one is "the Oak of Moreh," and another "the Saint of the Pillar" (see Stanley's 'Sermons in. the East,' p. 182). And we are very strongly led to this conclusion by the further fact that there was a famous oak at Shechem, mentioned <a href="../../par/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> as the place where Jacob hid the idols of his household; and that Joshua took a great stone and "set it up under the oak that was by the sanctuary of the Lord" at Shechem (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25, 26</a>). It marks a sad declension in the condition of Israel at this time, as compared with the days of Joshua, that the Shechemite Abimelech should be made king with a view to the restoration of Baal-worship on the very spot where theft fathers had made a solemn covenant to serve the Lord. It is remarkable that the narrative in this chapter gives us no clue as to the relations of the rest of Israel with Abimelech. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 9:7-21

The rich vegetation of that well-watered spot, "unparalleled in Palestine," supplied the materials of his fable; for the olive, the fig, the vine all grow in that rich valley; while the bramble, which creeps up the barren side of the mountain, and which is still used to kindle the fire to roast the lamb at the Samaritan Passover, was to be seen there in abundance.

It is remarked that in the Indian and Greek fables the animals are the <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span>, the fox, the lion, the ass, etc.; whereas in the only two specimens of Hebrew fable remaining to us, the members of the vegetable kingdom, the olive, the fig, the vine, the bramble, the cedar, the thistle, are the actors and speakers. The <span class="accented">parable</span>, of which <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a> is a beautiful example, is quite different in its structure. Like the inimitable parables of our Saviour in the New Testament, it sets forth Divine troth under an image, but the image and all its parts are in strict accordance with nature. In the Scripture <span class="accented">allegory</span> real persons and their actions prefigure the actions and the persons which they are intended to represent (see <a href="../../par/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21-31</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>). Allegorical personages may, however, be fictitious, as in the 'Pilgrim's Progress.' The general meaning of this fable is clear. The trees worthy to reign for their intrinsic excellence refused the proffered kingdom one after another. The vilest and most unworthy accepted it. The result would be that a fire would burst out from the despicable bramble, and set fire to the lofty cedar tree. Thus Gideon refused the kingdom, and his sons had virtually refused it likewise. The base-born Abimelech had accepted it, and the result would be a deadly strife, which would destroy both the ungrateful subjects and the unworthy ruler.

The simple reference to Gideon's great actions, and the juxtaposition of the base and bloody deed in which the Shechemites and the men of the house of Millo had made themselves accomplices by choosing Abimelech for their king, formed an indictment which could not be answered. With lofty scorn and irony he wishes well to them if they had acted honourably; but if not, he predicts the inevitable Nemesis of an alliance founded in bloodshed and treachery and wrong, viz., the mutual hatred and destruction of the contracting parties. Observe how "the house of Millo" is consistently spoken of as a separate community from "the men of Shechem."

The Hebrew word here used is quite a different one from that in vers. 8, 10, 12, 14, and elsewhere, where the reign of a king is designated. It means to exercise dominion, to be a chief or captain over a people. The use of it here suggests that though, as we read in ver. 6, the Canaanite men of Shechem and the house of Millo had made him their king, yet he was not made king by the tribes in general, only he exercised a kind of dominion over them, or over a sufficiently large portion of them to warrant their being called <span class="accented">Israel.</span>

Their disaffection first showed itself in acts of brigandage "against the peace of their lord the king," to use the language of our own mediaeval lawyers. The road to Shechem was no longer safe; lawless freebooters, in defiance of Abimelech's authority, stopped and robbed all travellers that passed that way, probably including Abimelech's own officers and servants. <span class="cmt_word">For him</span>.

And then, speaking freely under the influence of wine, they cursed Abimelech.

In the first we have the contemptuous question, "Who is David?" and in the second the analogous one, "What portion have we in David?" but in both we have the same person described by different terms: "Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse?" and, "What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse." Here, therefore, it is clear that <span class="accented">Shechem</span> is merely another name for <span class="accented">Abimelech</span>; and it is easy to see why. Abimelech's mother was a Canaanite bond-woman, a Shechemite; and the plea for making Abimelech king was, "for he is our brother" (vers. 2, 3). <span class="accented">Shechem</span>, or <span class="accented">the son of Shechem</span>, was therefore a natural description of Abimelech. But, adds Gaal, <span class="cmt_word">is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</span> (is not) <span class="cmt_word">Zebul his officer?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he is not a real Shechemite; he is the son of Jerubbaal; and what right has he to reign over you Shechemites? And why should Zebul lord it over you? He is only Abimelech's officer, <span class="cmt_word">No; serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem</span>. Fling off the yoke of the Abi-ezrite stranger, and set up a real Canaanite government from the old race of Hamor, the true founder and head of Shechem (cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-52</a>).

But whatever the cause was, as soon as he was there, Abimelech, according to Zebul's advice in ver. 33, had begun to descend from the mountains into the valley to "set upon the city."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-42.htm">Judges 9:42</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42, 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass</span>, etc. The Shechemites, believing Abimelech to have retired, and hoping that he would be satisfied with the chastisement inflicted upon them in the battle of the day before, left the protection of their walls next morning to pursue their usual avocations in the field. Abimelech's spies in the city being aware of their intention immediately reported it to him. Upon which he hastily took his army, divided them as before into three companies, lay in ambush in the field till the Shechemites were well out in the country, then attacked the Shechemites in the field with two of the companies, and himself at the head of the third rushed to the city gate to intercept their retreat. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-43.htm">Judges 9:43</a></div><div class="verse">And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people <i>were</i> come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</div><div class="comm">

The Hebrew has companies, but the sense requires the singular. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a></div><div class="verse">And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that <i>was</i> therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abimelech fought against the city</span>, etc. When all the Shechemites in the field were smitten or dispersed, Abimelech stormed the city, weakened as it was by the previous loss of so many of its defenders. The city made an obstinate defence notwithstanding, but was taken before night, and all the inhabitants were put to the sword. The walls were then razed to the ground, and the site was sown with salt to express the wish that it might be barren and uninhabited for ever (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>, marg.; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>). This action of sowing with salt is not elsewhere mentioned; but it is well known that salt destroys vegetation, and is used by gardeners for this very purpose. Pliny (quoted by Rosenmuller) says, <span class="accented">Omnis locus in quo reperitur sal sterilis est.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a></div><div class="verse">And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard <i>that</i>, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - The men of the tower of Sechem. The tower of Shechem is no doubt the same fortified building as was spoken of in vers. 6 and 20 by the name of the house of Millo (see note to ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">An</span>, or rather the, <span class="cmt_word">hold</span>. The word so rendered occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">high places</span>, and is coupled with caves, <span class="accented">thickets</span>, <span class="accented">rocks</span>, and <span class="accented">pits</span>, as one of the hiding-places of the Israelites from the Philistines. It was probably some kind of keep built on an eminence, and the place where the treasure of the temple was kept (ver. 4). It appears from the narrative that the tower of Shechem, or house of Millo, was not actually part of Shechem, nor immediately contiguous, since the report of the capture of Shechem had to be carried thither. <span class="cmt_word">The god Berith</span>. It should rather be <span class="accented">El-berith</span>, the same as <span class="accented">Baal-berith</span> in ver. 4 - <span class="accented">El</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. god</span>, being substituted for <span class="accented">Baal</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a></div><div class="verse">And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-48.htm">Judges 9:48</a></div><div class="verse">And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that <i>were</i> with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid <i>it</i> on his shoulder, and said unto the people that <i>were</i> with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, <i>and</i> do as I <i>have done</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mount Zalmon</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="accented">shady</span> mount, so called from the thick wood which grows upon it. It was in the neighbourhood of Shechem, and is perhaps the same as that mentioned in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a> as famous for its snow-storms. <span class="cmt_word">An axe</span>. The Hebrew has <span class="accented">axes</span>. If this is right, the phrase <span class="cmt_word">in his hand</span> must be rendered <span class="accented">with him</span>, as <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-34.htm">1 Samuel 14:34</a>: Each one his ox <span class="accented">in his hand</span>, <span class="accented">i.e. with him</span>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-10.htm">Jeremiah 38:10</a>: Take thirty men <span class="accented">in thy</span> hand, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. with thee; and elsewhere. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a></div><div class="verse">And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put <i>them</i> to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set the hold on fire</span> - thus literally fulfilling Jotham's curse in vers. 15 and 20. It is thought by many that those who thus perished miserably by suffocation and fire in the hold of the temple of Baal-berith had taken sanctuary there, not occupied it for the purposes of defence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-50.htm">Judges 9:50</a></div><div class="verse">Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thebez</span>. A place so called still existed in the time of Eusebius between Neapolis (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Shechem) and Scythopolis (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Beth-shean), about thirteen miles from Shechem. It still survives in the large and beautiful village of <span class="accented">Tubas</span>, which, Robinson tells us, is on the Roman road between Nabulus and Beishan. Thebez had evidently joined the rebellion against Abimelech. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-51.htm">Judges 9:51</a></div><div class="verse">But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut <i>it</i> to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of the city</span>. In Hebrew (<span class="accented">baaley</span>) <span class="accented">the men of the city</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the owners or citizens, the same phrase as is used throughout the chapter of <span class="accented">the men of Shechem</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-11.htm">1 Samuel 23:11, 12</a>). The English phrase <span class="accented">master</span>, or <span class="accented">my masters</span>, is very similar. The A.V. has here paraphrased it <span class="accented">they of the city</span>, to avoid the repetition of the word <span class="accented">men</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The top</span> - the flat <span class="accented">roof</span> or <span class="accented">house-top.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-52.htm">Judges 9:52</a></div><div class="verse">And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To burn it with fire</span> - encouraged by his success at the tower of Shechem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a></div><div class="verse">And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A millstone</span>. The word here used means the <span class="accented">upper millstone</span>, which <span class="accented">rides</span> as it were, or moves, over the fixed nether stone. <span class="cmt_word">All to brake his skull</span>. This obsolete English phrase has been the subject of a recent controversy. In the older English of Chaucer and his immediate successors such compounds as <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> were very common, and were frequently preceded by the adverb <span class="accented">all.</span> Hence, some English scholars would read the phrase here, <span class="accented">and all to-brake his skull.</span> It is, however, certain that before the time when the A.V. was made the compounds <span class="accented">to-break</span>, <span class="accented">to-burst</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> had become entirely obsolete, and the compound <span class="accented">all-to</span> had come into use. The right way, therefore, in which to read the present phrase <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">and all-to brake his skull</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> smashed it, dashed it in pieces. The prefix <span class="accented">all-to</span> gives intensity to the verb. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-54.htm">Judges 9:54</a></div><div class="verse">Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His armour-bearer</span> - an office of trust, entailing much intimacy. Saul loved David greatly, and he became his armor-bearer (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>). Compare the similar incident of Saul and his armour-bearer in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-6</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-55.htm">Judges 9:55</a></div><div class="verse">And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 55.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Israel</span> - Abimelech's followers (see ver. 22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-56.htm">Judges 9:56</a></div><div class="verse">Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which he did unto his father</span>. It is remarkable that the sacred writer, in calling attention to the righteous vengeance which fell upon the head of Abimelech, marks especially the conduct of Abimelech as undutiful to his father (see <a href="../../par/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-4.htm">Matthew 15:4</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24-26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/judges/9-57.htm">Judges 9:57</a></div><div class="verse">And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Shechem</span>. Not here <span class="accented">baaley</span>, but simply men. Each such evidence of the righteous judgment of God is a presage of the judgment to come, and encourages the reflection of the Psalmist: "Verily there is a reward for the righteous; doubtless there is a God that judgeth the earth" (<a href="../../par/psalms/58-10.htm">Psalm 58:10</a>, Pr.
