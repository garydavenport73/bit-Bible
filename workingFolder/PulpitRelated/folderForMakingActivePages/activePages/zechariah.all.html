The mention of teraphim in this passage is thought to indicate a date anterior to the Captivity; but the prophet is speaking of past events, of the results of these base superstitions in former, not present, time. Three kinds of superstition are mentioned. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "speaking" images.

The Vulgate seems to be correct, "dreams, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> dreamers, spake deceit." This is the third class among the practisers of superstitious observances. They comfort in vain, when they promise temporal blessings (<a href="../../par/job/21-34.htm">Job 21:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore they went their way as a flock.</span> Because they trusted in these vain superstitions, the Israelites had to leave their own place, were led into exile like a flock of sheep driven away for sale or slaughter (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They were troubled.</span> They were and are still oppressed by the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Because there was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">no shepherd.</span> Because they had no king to guard and lead them, they fell under the power of foreign rulers, who ill treated and oppressed them (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-15.htm">Nehemiah 5:15</a>).

Some commentators raise "the shepherds" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 5</a>, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I punished</span> (<span class="accented">will punish</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the goats</span> (<span class="accented">bellwethers</span>); literally, <span class="accented">will visit upon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will chastise. The same word (<span class="accented">paquad</span>) is used in the next clause in a good sense. The "goats" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (<a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>). The house of Judah here includes all the nation, to which it afterwards gave its name. <span class="cmt_word">Hath made</span> (<span class="accented">shall make</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them as his goodly horse</span>. The Israelites shall not only be delivered from oppression, but God shall use them as a stately war horse, richly caparisoned, to tread down enemies and triumph ever them. So he said before (<a href="../../par/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see <a href="../../par/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.)

Attempts have been made to find the fulfilment of these prophecies (ver. 3, etc.) in certain events of Maccabean times. Thus, according to Patritius, the sin for which the Hebrews surfeited such distress at the hands of the Seleucidae (ver. 2) was their imitation of heathen practices mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:13-15 and 2 Macc. 4:7-17, when the high priest purchased his office by a bribe, and the other priests followed Greek customs. The prophet is supposed to refer specially to this state of things when he says, "They were troubled because there was no shepherd. Mine auger was kindled against the shepherds." But we have shown above that Zechariah is here speaking of the past, not of the future. There is more verisimilitude in discerning the wars and victories of Judas, his brothers and successors, in the allusions of vers 4-7. The truth is that such descriptions suit many different events, and have various applications. Though their complete fulfilment may be expected only in Messianic times and circumstances, yet we may see many anticipatory and preparative transactions, which are meant to introduce the final accomplishment. The Jewish prophet is not always foretelling certain definite events. Oftentimes he is teaching, warning, and exhorting; and generally he is enunciating great principles, the truth of which shall be clear in the future, rather than predicting particular facts. Not unfrequently commentators have neglected this consideration, and sought too curiously to restrict the prophet's words to some one issue. It may be noted, further, that where the prophetic language concerning the destiny of the restored people seems to be exaggerated and not borne out by subsequent facts, the promises are always conditioned by the moral state of the recipients. If they answered fully and consistently to God's call, the result would be such as was predicted. That the event in all respects did not correspond with the high ideal previously announced must be attributed, not to the prophet's mistake, but to the people's waywardness and disobedience.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/10-11.htm">Zechariah 10:11</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall pass through the sea with affliction.</span> In bringing his people back the Lord is ready to repeat the miracles of the Exodus. This is the general meaning of the passage; but the details present difficulties. For "he shall pass" the LXX. gives, "they shall pass through." But the reference is plainly to Jehovah, as the following clause shows. The next two words are in apposition, "the sea," "affliction." Revised Version, "the sea of affliction;" Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in a strait sea;" or, as the Hebrew cannot be so translated, "in a sea, a strait;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">in maris freto.</span> It seems best to take the two words simply as, "the sea, which is affliction." The Red Sea, through which Jehovah led his people, was a figure of the sufferings which they had endured in Egypt, and brought destruction upon their enemies (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16, 17, 24</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Smite the waves</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-15.htm">Isaiah 11:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The river.</span> The Nile. The drying up of the waters of the Nile is a figure of the humiliation of the nations which have been guilty of enslaving the chosen people. The Nile. the representative of Egypt, is mentioned because of the allusion to the bondage in Egypt running through the paragraph. <span class="cmt_word">The pride of Assyria.</span> Pride is noted as the characteristic of Assyria (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-7.htm">Isaiah 10:7</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3, 10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The sceptre.</span> This may refer to the decadence of the power of Egypt, and the transference of royal authority to strangers; but, regarding the immediate context, we had better translate, "the rod of Egypt," and see in it an allusion to the oppression of the taskmasters during the sojourn in that land. All such tyranny shall be at an end (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-24.htm">Isaiah 10:24</a>).

The Septuagint reads, "They shall boast themselves." So God will work wonders to deliver his people from the captivity of the devil, destroying all enemies, visible and invisible, which array themselves against him. This is the final fulfilment of the prophecy. The complete restoration from the Captivity is the immediate subject of the prophet's words; and between these two we may see a reference to the conversion of the Jews in the time of Christ and the apostles, which shall go on until the end.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm"><title>Zechariah 11 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/zechariah/11.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/zechariah/11.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/zechariah/11-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../zechariah/10.htm" title="Zechariah 10">&#9668;</a> Zechariah 11 <a href="../zechariah/12.htm" title="Zechariah 12">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/11-1.htm">Zechariah 11:1</a></div><div class="verse">Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Open thy doors, O Lebanon.</span> The prophet graphically portrays the punishment that is to fall upon the people. The sin that occasions this chastisement, viz. the rejection of their Shepherd and King, is denounced later (&sect; 9). Lebanon stood in the path of an invader from the north, whence most hostile armies entered Palestine. The "doors" of Lebanon are the mountain passes which gave access to the country. Some commentators, following an old Jewish interpretation, take Lebanon to mean the temple or Jerusalem; but we are constrained to adhere primarily to the literal signification by the difficulty of carrying on the metaphorical allusions in the following clauses. <span class="cmt_word">That the fire may devour thy cedars.</span> That the invader may wantonly destroy thy trees which are thy glory and thy boast.

It is the tree of which Solomon made floors, doom, and ceiling in his temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15, 34</a>), and David harps (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>).

Trees are being spoken of, and so the primary sense is, "the goodly" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a>) or "glorious trees." Metaphorically, the chiefs of Israel may be intended. <span class="cmt_word">Bashan</span>, famous for its oaks, is next visited by the invading force, and its trees are felled for the use of the enemy. <span class="cmt_word">The forest of the vintage.</span> The Authorized Version here follows, very inappropriately, the correction of the Keri.

The lion is not now found in Palestine, but must have been common in earlier times, especially in such places as the brushwood and reedy coverts which line the margin of the Jordan. The prophet introduces the inanimate and animate creation - trees, men, beasts - alike deploring the calamity. And the terms in which this is depicted point to some great disaster and ruin, and, as it seems, to the final catastrophe of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, the punishment of the rejection of Messiah. This reference becomes plainer as we proceed. It is inadmissible to refer the passage (as some do) to the Assyrian invasions mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>. Holding the post-exilian origin of the prophecy, we are bound to interpret it in accordance with this view, which, indeed, presents fewer difficulties than the other.

The prophet is speaking of chiefs and rulers, civil and ecclesiastical, who played into the enemies' hands, and thought of nothing but how to make a gain of the subject people. Our Lord denounces such untrustworthy shepherds (<a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-13</a>). Doubtless, too, the expressions in the text refer to the foreign powers which had oppressed the Jews at various times, Egypt, Assyria, etc. Amid all such distresses, from whatever cause, God still had tender care for his people, and punished and will punish their enemies. In this verse the offenders against Israel are of three classes - buyers, sellers, shepherds (see ver. 8). "Shepherd" appears sometimes in the Assyrian inscriptions as a synonym for "prince" (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 453) : 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/11-6.htm">Zechariah 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver <i>them</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the land</span>. It is a question whether by this expression is meant the Israelites, or the dwellers on earth generally. In the former ease, the verso gives the reason of the calamities depicted in ver. 5, viz. God's displeasure, and expounds the parable of the sheep as meaning men (so Cheyne). In the other case, the signification of the paragraph is that God intends to put an end to the state of things just described, by punishing the oppressing world powers who had so cruelly executed their office of being instruments of God's judgment on his people. The latter seems the correct exposition; for the people of Israel have just been called the flock of slaughter, and they were to be fed, while these "inhabitants" are to be destroyed; nor could the Israelites be said to have kings, as just below. Thus for, at the beginning of the verse, introduces the reason why Jehovah tells the shepherd to feed the flock, because he is about to punish their oppressors; and "the inhabitants of the land" should be "the inhabitants of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nations of the world, among whom the Israelites lived. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver the men,</span> etc. God will give up the nations to intestine commotions and civil war, so that they shall fall by mutual slaughter. <span class="cmt_word">Into the hand of his king.</span> Each of them shall be delivered over helpless unto their tyrant's hands, and God will not interpose to succour them.

It is also rendered "in sooth." The LXX., arranging the letters differently, translates, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> "I will go and tend the flock of slaughter in the land of Canaan;" some render the last words, "for the merchants." This Jerome interprets to mean that the Lord will nourish the Israelites for slaughter in the land of the Gentiles (but see note on ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And I took unto me two staves.</span> Executing in vision his commission of feeding the flock, the prophet, as the representative of the Shepherd, took two shepherd's staves. The two staves intimate the manifold care of God for his flock from the earliest days, and the two blessings which he designed to bestow (as the names of the staves show), favour and unity. <span class="cmt_word">Beauty</span>; <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">Decorem</span> (Vulgate); "Graciousness" (Revised Version margin). It probably means the favour and grace of God, as in <a href="../../par/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Bands</span>; literally, <span class="accented">Those that bind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "Cord;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Funiculum.</span> The name is meant to express the union of all the members of the flock, especially that between Israel and Judah (see ver. 14). These make one flock under one shepherd. <span class="cmt_word">I fed the flock.</span> This repetition emphasizes the beginning of the verse, and expresses God's ears in time past and in time to come also. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/11-8.htm">Zechariah 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - In executing the office of feeding the flock, <span class="cmt_word">three shepherds also I out off in one month;</span> Septuagint, "And I will take away the three shepherds in one month." The article in the Hebrew and Greek seems to point to some known shepherds, three in number, unless we take it as "threes of the shepherds." Hence expositors have sought to find historical personages to whom the term might apply. Those who assert a pre-exilian origin for this part of the prophecy, suggest the three kings, Zachariah, Shallum, and Menahem; or, as Menahem reigned ten years, some unrecorded pretender, who started up at the time. Others see some Syrian monarchs in Maccabean times; or the three offices, king, prophet, priest; or the three dynasties that oppressed Israel, viz. the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, and Macedonian. All these interpretations fail in some point; and we are reduced to see herein a reference, as Cheyne says, to "the prompt and vigorous action of Jehovah's Shepherd in dealing with the evil shepherds, as well as in feeding the flock;" the number three being used indefinitely. Or we may find in this number an allusion to the three classes in ver. 5 - the buyers, the sellers, and the pitiless shepherds. The oppressors, external and internal, are removed and cut off in one month. To the  prophet's eye all this seemed to take place in that short space of time. If anything more is intended, we may, with Keil and others, taking the month as consisting of thirty days, assume that ten days are assigned to the destruction of each shepherd, after each had fulfilled his allotted period - the number ten expressing perfection or completion. <span class="cmt_word">And my soul loathed them;</span> literally, <span class="accented">but my soul was straitened for them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was impatient, weary of them. These words begin a new paragraph, and refer, not to the three shepherds, but to the sheep, the Israelites. The prophet now shows how ill the people had responded to God's manifold care, and mingles with the past a view of their future ingratitude and disobedience which will bring upon them final ruin. God, as it were, was weary of their continual backslidings and obstinate perseverance in evil. (For the phrase, see <a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/16-16.htm">Judges 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-4.htm">Job 21:4</a>.) It is the opposite to long suffering. <span class="cmt_word">Their soul also abhorred me.</span> They showed their abhorrence by their devotion to idols and their disinclination for all goodness.

Many see here a reference to the awful scenes enacted when Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans, and intestine feuds filled the city with bloodshed and added to the horrors of famine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">And I took my staff, <i>even</i> Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cut it asunder.</span> The breaking of the staff "Beauty" indicates that God withdraws his grace and protection; he will no longer shield the people from the attack of foes, as the following words express. <span class="cmt_word">My covenant which I had made with all the people;</span> rather, <span class="accented">with all the peoples</span>. God calls the restriction which he had laid on foreign nations to prevent them from afflicting Israel, "a covenant."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/11-11.htm">Zechariah 11:11</a></div><div class="verse">And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it <i>was</i> the word of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was broken.</span> The covenant just mentioned (ver. 10) was broken. <span class="cmt_word">And so the poor of the flock that waited upon me</span> (<span class="accented">that gave heed unto me</span>) <span class="cmt_word">know</span>. The punishment inflicted on the withdrawal of God's protection had some good result. Though the bulk of the nation took no heed, learned no lesson, yet the humble and the suffering among them, who paid respect to his words, recognized that what happened was according to God's Word, and knew that all the rest would be fulfilled in due season. This was the effect of the Captivity; it forced the Israelites to see the hand of the Lord in the calamities that had befallen them, and it drove the thoughtful among them to repentance and amendment (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/9-8.htm">Daniel 9:8</a>, etc.). The breaking asunder of the first staff refers primarily to the time of the exile, and not to the absolute relinquishment of the flock. One staff is left, and for a time utter destruction is postponed. For "the poor," the LXX. reads, as in ver. 7, "the Cananeans," meaning probably "merchants." Ewald and others, who hold the pre-exilian date of this prophecy, see here an allusion to the invasion of the Assyrians under Pul (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>).

He asks his hire of the flock, because the flock represents men. Acting far differently from the wicked shepherds, he used no violence or threats. He gives them this last opportunity of showing their gratitude for all the care bestowed upon them, and their appreciation of his tenderness and love. The wages God looked for were repentance, faith, obedience, or, in another view, themselves, their life and soul. It was for their sake he required these, not for his own. <span class="cmt_word">If not, forbear.</span> He speaks with indignation, as conscious of their ungrateful contempt. Pay me what is due, or pay me not. I leave it to you to decide. I put no constraint upon you. So God has given us free will; and we can receive or reject his offers, as we are minded. <span class="cmt_word">So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</span> This paltry remuneration displayed the people's ingratitude and contempt. It was the compensation offered by the Law to a master for the loss of a slave that had been killed (Exodus 21:82). It was, perhaps, double the pries of a female slave (<a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>); and the very offer of such a sum was an insult, and, says Dr. Alexander, "suggested an intention to compass his death. They despised his goodness; they would have none of his service; they sought to cut him off; and they were ready to pay the penalty which the Law prescribed for the murder of one of so mean a condition." The word "weigh" was used in money transactions even after the use of coined money rendered weighing unnecessary.

This involves an alteration of the text, and is in itself an improbable reading, as God could not be made to tell the prophet to throw this despicable wage into his treasury, unless, perchance, it is said ironically. There may be an undesigned coincidence here. In <a href="../../par/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a> the council discuss the propriety of putting the thirty pieces of silver into the treasury. But taking our present text as genuine, commentators usually consider the phrase as a proverbial expression for contemptuous treatment; as the Greeks said, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as the Germans say, "zum Schinder," "to the knacker," and we, "to the dogs." There is, however, no trace elsewhere of any such proverb, nor do we know how it could have arisen; it likewise does not very well suit the last clause of the verse, "I cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord." If we substitute the supposed analogous expression, "I threw them to the dogs," we see how unseemly would be the proverb in this connection. The rendering of the Jews in old time, adopted recently by Knabenbauer, "Cast them to the Creator," is considered by Dr. Pusey to be unidiomatic, and involves great difficulties. It seems simpler to consider that the command, "cast it to the potter," implies contemptuous rejection of the sum, and at the same time intimates the ultimate destination to which, in the sight of Omniscience, it was directed. The potter is named as the workman who makes the meanest utensils out of the vilest material. That this was ordered and executed in vision is plain; how much the prophet understood we cannot tell. The ambiguous and highly typical order was explained and fulfilled to the letter by the action of Judas Iscariot, as the evangelist testifies (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">goodly price</span>, etc. This is ironical, of course. Such was the price at which they estimated the good Shepherd's services. <span class="cmt_word">Cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.</span> This rejection of the paltry wage took place in the house of the Lord (in the vision), because the insult had been really offered to him, and this was the natural place where oblations would be made; thus the transaction was represented as formal and national. Whether the potter was seen in the temple we know not. The prophet was made to connect him in some way with the business; and we learn from the fulfilment that the potter did in the end receive the money, which was paid for his field applied to an unclean purpose. In <a href="../../par/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a> the two verses, 12, 13, with some variations, are quoted as "spoken by Jeremy the prophet." Hence some attribute this part of Zechariah to Jeremiah; and others think that in St. Matthew the present name is a mistake. The probability is that the evangelist did not name any prophet, but that some early transcriber, remembering the purchase of the field in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-12</a>, attributed the quotation to that prophet. Or we may suppose that inspiration did not extend to all minor details, nor save the writers from unimportant errors.

The breaking of the first staff indicated that God withdrew his defensive care; the breaking of the staff called "Bands" signifies the utter dissolution of all the bends that held the nation together, the civil and social disunion that paved the way for the victory of the Romans, and issued in the final disruption which sent the Jews wandering through the world. This in the vision is represented as the breaking of the brotherhood between Judah and Israel, the component parts of the nation. Thus was hinted the ultimate rejection of the Jews in consequence of their treatment of Christ, the good Shepherd, who came unto his own, and his own received him not (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36-38</a>). This doom is declared more fully in the next section.

The prophet, in vision, is directed to do as he had done before (ver. 4, etc,), and enact the part of a shepherd, taking the dress, scrip, and crook, which were appropriate to the character; but this time he was to represent "a foolish," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an evil, shepherd; for sin is constantly denoted by "folly" in the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/job/5-2.htm">Job 5:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-17.htm">Psalm 107:17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-22.htm">Proverbs 7:22</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/14-9.htm">Proverbs 14:9</a>, etc. (comp. ver. 17).

He was going to allow the people to be chastised by an instrument whom he would permit to work his will upon them. As this evil shepherd was to arise to punish them for their rejection of  Messiah, he must represent some person or power that existed subsequent to Christ's death. Many consider that he symbolizes the Romans; but these people could not be deemed to exercise pastoral care over the Israelites, nor could their neglect of this (ver. 17) be attributed to them as a sin; nor, again, did their destruction follow upon the overthrow of the Jewish polity (ver. 18). Others see here a prediction of the coming of antichrist; but the character of "shepherd" does not suit his attributes as given elsewhere; at any rate. this cannot be the primary reference of the symbol, though all evil powers that oppose the Church of Christ are in some sense images and anticipations of antichrist. The genuine reference here is to the native chiefs and rulers ("in the land") who arose in the later times of the nation - monsters like Herod, false Christs and false prophets (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-5.htm">Matthew 24:5, 11, 12, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>), hirelings who made merchandise of the flock, teachers who came in their own name (<a href="../../par/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>), and deceived the people to their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">Which shall not visit those that be cut off;</span> or, <span class="accented">those that are perishing.</span> This foolish shepherd shall perform none of the offices of a good shepherd; he will not care for and tend those that are in danger of death (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The young one;</span> rather, <span class="accented">those that are scattered</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">dispersum</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-12.htm">Matthew 18:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That that is broken.</span> Bruised, or with limb fractured. <span class="cmt_word">Feed that that standeth still;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that standeth</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is sound and healthy.

Cheyne, "And also on [or, 'over '] Judah it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the protection and deliverance implied in the first clause of the verse] shall be, in the siege," etc. Any  interpretation of the passage which makes Judah join with the enemy in attacking Jerusalem is precluded by the very intimate union between Judah and Jerusalem denoted in vers. 4-7, and by the hostility of the nations against Judah. Cheyne's explanation is hardly a natural one, however suitable. Lowe ('Hebr. Stud.

It seems best to render, with Alexander, "Also against Judah shall it be in the siege against Jerusalem," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not only the mother city, but all the country, shall be exposed to hostile invasion.

The prophet declares that the open towns and villages of Judah, which can offer no effectual resistance to an enemy like the fortified city Jerusalem, shall be saved by the aid of God, as so often has happened in old time. If "first" be the genuine reading, the meaning is that the country people shall first be saved in order to prevent Jerusalem glorifying herself at their expense. <span class="cmt_word">That the glory...do not magnify themselves against</span> (<span class="accented">be not magnified above</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Judah</span>.

"Grace" here means the effects produced in man by God's favour, that which makes the recipient pleasing to God and delighting in his commandments (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.</span> The Speaker is Jehovah.

We may say generally that the clause intimates that the people, who had grieved and offended God by their sins and ingratitude, should repent and turn to him in faith. But there was a literal fulfilment of this piercing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> slaying (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-3.htm">Zechariah 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>), when the Jews crucified the Messiah, him who was God and Man, and of whom, as a result of the hypostatic union, the properties of one nature are often predicated of the other. Thus St. Paul says that the Jews crucified "the Lord of glory" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>), and bids the Ephesian elders "feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; for the reading <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, see the critics). St. John (<a href="../../par/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>) refers to these words of Zechariah as a prophecy of the Crucifixion (camp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "They shall look to me because they insulted," either reading the last verb differently, or understanding it figuratively in the sense of assailing with cutting words; but there is no doubt about the true reading and interpretation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt.</span> "Me" has been altered in some manuscripts into "him:" but this is an evident gloss received into the text for controversial purposes, or to obviate the supposed impropriety of representing Jehovah as slain by the impious. That St. John seems to sanction this reading is of no critical importance, as he is merely referring to the prophecy historically, and does not profess to give the very wording of the prophet. A suffering Messiah was not an unknown idea in Zechariah's time. He has already spoken of the Shepherd as despised and ill-treated, and a little further on (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>) he intimates that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah had familiarized him with the same notion (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, etc.). And when he represents Jehovah as saying, "Me whom they pierced," it is not merely that in killing his messenger and representative they may be said to have killed him, but the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, even as Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) called him the "Mighty God," and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The "looking to" the stricken Messiah began when they who saw that woeful sight smote their breasts (<a href="../../par/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>); it was carried on by the preaching of the apostles; it shall continue till all Israel is converted; it is re-enacted whenever penitent sinners turn to him whom they have crucified by their sins. Critics have supposed that the person whose murder is deplored is Isaiah, or Urijah, or Jeremiah; but none of these fulfill the prediction in the text. <span class="cmt_word">They shall mourn for him.</span> There is a change of persons here. Jehovah speaks of the Messiah as distinct in Person from himself. <span class="cmt_word">As one mourneth for his only son...  for his firstborn.</span> The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). The mention of "piercing," just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities  and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians (see <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 6. p. 131, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - As if the above comparisons were not strong enough, the prophet presents a new one, referring to an historical event, which occasioned a universal mourning in Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As the mourning of</span> (<span class="accented">at</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</span> This is generally supposed to refer to the death of King Josiah of a wound received at Megiddo, in the battle with Pharaoh-Necho ( <span class="date">B.C. 60</span>) ),and to the national lamentation made for him and long observed on the anniversary of the calamity (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-25</a>). This universal and perennial mourning is a figure of the continual remembrance of the death of Christ in the Church. There is a difficulty about the identification of Hadadrimmon. St. Jerome says it was a place in the Plain of Megiddo, near Jezreel, and known in his day by the name of Maximianopolis. This is supposed to be <span class="accented">Rummaneh</span>, seven miles northwest of Jezreel, on the southern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon. But the identification is far from certain. The Assyrian name given to the place may, as Lowe suggests, be a confirmation of the post-exilian origin of the prophecy. The site of Megiddo also is undetermined, though Condor suggests <span class="accented">Mujedda</span>, a ruined city about three miles south of Bethshean. The opinion that the name Hadadrimmon is that of a Syrian or Phoenician god, whose rites were celebrated as those of Adonis ("the weeping for Tammuz" of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-14.htm">Ezekiel 8:14</a>), is preposterous; and the idea that the prophet would thus refer to the worship of an abominable idol is one that could have occurred only to disbelievers in revelation. The LXX., mistaking the text, gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "as mourning for a pomegranate cut off in the plain."

The prophet names the two chief sins which had brought ruin on the old theocracy - idolatry and false prophetism, and declares that these shall not be found in the new theocracy. As these two sins were not specially prevalent after the Captivity, some see in their mention here an argument for the pre-exilian authorship of this part of Zechariah. But the prophet, grounding his message on past history, does well to give assurance that such lapses shall not happen again. Nor is it altogether certain that the warning against these errors was not needed after the return. There were false prophets in Nehemiah's time (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and we read in the Book of Maccabees that many Jews adopted heathen rites and customs, among which the worship of idols must have been included (1 Macc. 1:11, etc.; 2 Macc. 4:13, etc.), and the people and even priests contracted marriages with heathen wives (<a href="../../par/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23</a>); so that there was real danger of relapse. <span class="cmt_word">The prophets.</span> The false prophets are meant, as is evident from their being associated with idols and the unclean spirit, and from vers. 3-6.

Here the holy zeal of the parents should put the law in force. This was quite a different state of things from that which obtained in former times. The earlier prophets continually  complain of the favour shown to these deceivers (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>); and we never read of the legal punishment being inflicted after due investigation, the test being the nonfulfilment of the prediction (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>). In the new theocracy, so great is the recoil from such pretenders, that their nearest relations shall at once punish them with death without any previous legal process. <span class="cmt_word">Shall thrust him through.</span> Stab, pierce him, put him to death, as in ch. 12:10.

So eager is he now to hide his false pretensions, that he is willing, to be considered a slave, employed from his youth in farm work, and therefore incapable of executing the prophetical office.

St. Cyril and some modern commentators hold that the false prophet says this in sorrow and repentant, not with any idea of deceiving; and that herein is exhibited a signal instance of the grace of God in the Messanic period, when even such sinners are converted from the error of their ways. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/13-6.htm">Zechariah 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>one</i> shall say unto him, What <i>are</i> these wounds in thine hands?

Cheyne compares, "between his arms," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in his back (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>) and "between your eyes" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on your foreheads (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>). Not satisfied with the assertion in ver. 5, the questioner asks the meaning of these wounds which he sees on his body. Jerome considers these scars to be marks of correction and punishment at the hands of his parents. More probably they are thought to be self-infilcted in the service of some idol, according to the practice mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-37.htm">Jeremiah 48:37</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.</span> This may be a confession of guilt, the impostor owning that his friends, had thus punished him for his pretensions; or, as the word rendered "friends" is generally used in the case of illicit or impure love or spiritual fornication, it may be here applied to the idols whom he served. But it seems most probable that the answer is intentionally false and misleading; as if he had said, "The wounds were not made as you suppose, but are the result of something that happened to me in my friends' house." The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "with which I was struck in my beloved house." To see in this passage a reference to our blessed Lord and his crucifixion, though such an opinion has the support of the Roman Liturgy and of many interpreters, is to do violence to the context, and to read into the words a meaning wholly alien from the subject of false prophets, which is the matter in hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man <i>that is</i> my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - &sect; 4<span class="accented">.

The mention of the false prophet and the shameful wounds in his flesh leads him to the contrast of the true Prophet and the effects of his "piercing." The abruptness of the commencement of the verse is dramatic, and gives no sufficient cause for supposing that this paragraph ought to be transferred (as Ewald and others desire) to the end of ch. 11. (For a similar apostrophe, comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-6.htm">Jeremiah 47:6</a>.) It is introduced here to show that all that happened to the Shepherd was done after the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God; and as if the sword could never have dared to act thus except it were permitted by the Divine will. The "sword" represents any kind of instrument that inflicts death (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/5-21.htm">Exodus 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My Shepherd.</span> The Shepherd of Jehovah, who is speaking.

God could speak only of One thus associated with himself, that is, of him who could say, "I and my Father are One" (<a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).

Even the faithful few were scandalized at the cross The command, "Smite the Shepherd," like the apostrophe, "Awake, O sword," shows that it was God's purpose that was being there executed (see <a href="../../par/john/19-11.htm">John 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). It is also thus intimated that the dispersion of the Jews, and their denationalizing, were results of this rejection and smiting of the Shepherd. This dispersion is farther explained in vers. 8, 9, where it is shown that to some it will be ruin, to others salvation. I will turn mine hand. "To turn," or "bring back the hand over," is used in a good and a bad sense (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>). There is a promise of comfort in the use of the phrase here. God's hand shall cover and protect some, while he punishes the others. Those thus protected are called the little ones, the humble and meek. This recalls Christ's words to his disciples, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>).

It is a time when he will specially manifest his glory and power, and be recognized as allowing the trial of his people for wise purposes. It is impossible to fix on any historical fulfilment of this prophecy. The details suit neither Maccabean nor Roman times; the attempt to define exactly the period and matter of its accomplishment has proved a failure, and has led to a mingling of events of very different dates, and to a conglomeration of senses literal, metaphorical, and anagogical, which creates confusion while assuming to explain difficulties.

As the enemy are supposed to beset Jerusalem, so as to make escape by any ordinary road impossible, the Lord will open a way through the very centre of the mountain (as he opened a path through the Red Sea), by cleaving the hill in sunder, the two parts moving north and south, and leaving a great valley running east and west, and leading to the Arabah.

The meaning in this case is that the valley should extend from the west unto the east side of the Mount of Olives, and that in it the people shall find an asylum, that they might not be involved in the judgments which fall on the enemy. Some take <span class="accented">Azal</span> to mean "union," and see in it a symbol of the union of the Law and the gospel, or the Jew and Gentile, in one Church - the valley of God's mountain extending to "union;" that is, to enfolding all the faithful (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earthquake in the days of Uzziah.</span> This is mentioned in <a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, but not in the historical books (see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>).

With the absence of light and sun shall come bitter frost, which impedes all activity, and kills life: or, taking the Septuagint rendering, there shall no longer be the interchange of seasons, but one lasting sunshine. It is plain that a time of distress and calamity is intended, and that the passage is threatening and not consolatory, at any rate, at first.

It was situated in the territory of Simeon (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-7.htm">Joshua 19:7</a>), and has been identified with <span class="accented">Umm-er-Rummamin</span>, a town ten miles north of Beersheba. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be lifted up.</span> Jerusalem shall remain exalted on its hill, while all the country around sinks into a plain - a figure representing the spiritual exaltation of the new theocracy. <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited in her place;</span> or, <span class="accented">shall dwell in her place.</span> Shall occupy her ancient limits, and abide there safely without fear (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38-40</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">From Benjamin's gate,</span> etc. (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-13.htm">Jeremiah 37:13</a>). It is difficult to define the given boundaries with certainty in every particular.

It was situated in the north or second wall. From this point the course of the wall is followed, first to the west, and then to the east. <span class="cmt_word">The first gate.</span> This was in the eastern part at this wall, and is the same as "the old gate," or "gate of the old town," of <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The corner gate</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-13.htm">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>) was at the northwest corner, west of the gate of Benjamin, at the angle where the first and second walls approached each other. These dimensions would give the breadth of the city from east to west. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Hananeel</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>:l) was at the northeast corner of the north wall, where the citadel Basis or Antonia afterwards stood. <span class="cmt_word">The king's wine presses</span> were probably near "the king's garden" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>), at the southeast extremity of the city. They may have been cut out of the rock, as was often the case. This description gives the extent of the city from north to south. Thus Zechariah illustrates the growth and stability of the Church of God by the figure of the earthly city Jerusalem, firmly and orderly built, and inhabited by a teeming population, as the following verse shows. There is no ground for expecting the literal fulfilment of this prediction.

The prophet here and in the following clause speaks as a Jew to Jews, who knew and observed only the prescribed form of worship. It is evident that the announcement could never be literally fulfilled; the Gentile world could never come yearly to pay their devotions at Jerusalem. The prediction can only signify that under Messiah's reign the Gentiles shall be converted to true religion and worship God in regular, orderly fashion, the prophet intimating this in terms derived from the old dispensation, which had the Divine sanction. <span class="cmt_word">The Feast of Tabernacles.</span> The Israelites were required to appear before the Lord three times in the year (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>) - at the festivals of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. But the Gentiles are here required to present themselves only once. The Feast of Tabernacles is chosen for this occasion owing to its peculiar character and the associations connected with it. It commemorated not only the ingathering of the harvest, but also Israel's sojourn in the wilderness and tide Divine protection there accorded to them, and their entrance into tide promised land; it was therefore a fitting symbol of the rescue of the Gentiles from the devil's kingdom, and their entry into the Church of God, where they enjoyed the blessings of God's grace and protection. It was also a more catholic feast, in one sense, titan the Passover or Pentecost, not being so distinctively Jewish, but one which all nations could keep in gratitude to the Giver of material benefits. We must remember, also, that it was at this feast that our Lord cried (<a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink," and likewise he declared himself to be "the Light of the world" (<a href="../../par/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), wishing us, it may be, to understand that this feast was the one we should need to keep, being the one which specially sets  him forth as the Sustainer and Guide through life's pilgrimage.

Probably these plates had the names of the owners engraven on them.

Thus the vision of the golden candlestick (ch. 4.) is fulfilled; and that this should come to pass is the design of God's manifold providences and operations (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../malachi/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Malachi 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Malachi 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm"><title>Zechariah 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/zechariah/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/zechariah/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/zechariah/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../haggai/2.htm" title="Haggai 2">&#9668;</a> Zechariah 1 <a href="../zechariah/2.htm" title="Zechariah 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - &sect; 1. <span class="accented">Title of the book, and author. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The eighth month</span>.

Haggai had first prophesied two months earlier. <span class="cmt_word">The second year of Darius.</span> Being now under foreign rule, the prophet uses the regnal years of the king to whom his people were subject (see note on Haggai 1:1<span class="cmt_word">).

Not only events connected with their earlier history proved that God had been incensed with their forefathers, but the ruin of their kingdom, and the late Captivity, and the desolation around them, were evidence of the same sad truth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-3.htm">Zechariah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say thou unto them</span>. The prophet shows why he has reminded them of their forefathers' sins and punishment. Saith the Lord of hosts. The expression recurs three times in this verse; it denotes the almightiness and infinite resources of God (see note A in the appendix to Archdeacon Perowne's edition of this prophet). Its constant repetition, as in Haggai, gives a certain heaviness to the prophet's style. <span class="cmt_word">Turn</span> (<span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">ye unto me</span>. He calls the people to repentance, partly, doubtless, with a view to their taking an active part in rebuilding the temple, thus carrying on the exhortations of Haggai, but also with reference to their general indevotion and laxity which Ezra afterwards had to reprove (see <a href="../../par/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord of hosts;</span> literally, (<span class="accented">it is</span>) <span class="accented">the utterance of Jehovah of hosts.</span> This is a more threatening form than the mere "saith" in the other two places in this verse. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn (</span><span class="accented">return</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto you (</span><a href="../../par/malachi/3-7.htm">Malachi 3:7</a>).

They were called now to attend to the pure worship of the Lord, as the sole condition of prosperity (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-6.htm">2 Chronicles 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>). It has been well observed that when it is said, "Turn ye unto me," etc., we are reminded of our free will; and when we cry, "Turn us, good Lord, and we shall be turned," we acknowledge the need of God's preventing grace.

Thus were the people comforted by bearing God's purposes of mercy and the great future that awaited Israel. In this first vision it is revealed to Zechariah that the Gentile nations should be overthrown, and that whatever might be the present condition of the Jewish people, God's purpose of mercy toward them was unshaken and would be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">The four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat.</span> This month (called here by its Chaldean name) answered to parts of January and February. It was three months since Zechariah had been called to the prophetical office, and five since the building of the temple had been resumed at Haggai's remonstrance. Meantime Haggai had concluded his mission by uttering his final prophecies two months ago, and now Zechariah carries on the revelation. A comparison of the months in the cuneiform inscriptions with the Hebrew will be found in Schrader, 'Keilinschriften,' 379, and in Dr. Wright's note on this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord</span>. Thee visions with their explanations are in effect the oracle (see note on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that <i>were</i> in the bottom; and behind him <i>were there</i> red horses, speckled, and white.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw by night</span>; <span class="accented">in the night</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the night of the twenty-fourth day (ver. 7). The visions were seen in this one night at short intervals. There is nothing to make one suppose that they came in dreams (<a href="../../par/isaiah/29-7.htm">Isaiah 29:7</a>). The prophet is awake, but whether he sees these scenes with his bodily eyes, or was rapt in ecstasy, cannot be decided. <span class="cmt_word">A man riding upon a red horse.</span> This is the Angel of Jehovah, mentioned again in ver. 10 and in ver. 11, in both of which places the description, "that stood among the myrtle trees," serves to identify him. He is different from the interpreting angel, and is the leader of the company of horsemen that follow him. Keil and Wright consider that the rider on the red horse cannot be identified with the Angel of Jehovah, because otherwise he would have been represented as standing opposite to the other horsemen to receive the information which they brought him, and they would not have been spoken of as "behind" hint. But the expression in ver. 8 may mean merely that the prophet sets his eyes first on the leader and then on the attendants. Or in ver. 10 he is the spokesman who begins the account of the riders' doings, which these themselves complete in ver. 11. Thus there are in the scene only <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the prophet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the angel rider and his attendants; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the interpreting angel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The red colour of the horse is supposed to represent war and bloodshed, as in <a href="../../par/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>; but this seems unsuitable in this piece, where nothing of the kind is intimated, but rather the contrary (ver. 11). It is, indeed, impossible to affix any satisfactory explanation to the colour. If, as we may well suppose, this personage is the Angel of the covenant, who was the leader and guide of the Israelites (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>), his standing in the valley among the myrtles may represent the depressed and humbled condition of the chosen people, which yet was well pleasing unto God, like the sweet scent of odoriferous myrtles is agreeable to men. <span class="cmt_word">The myrtle trees.</span> The myrtle is indigenous in the hilly regions of Northern Palestine, and is still seen in the glens near Jerusalem, though no longer on the Mount of Olives, where the returned captives found it when celebrating their first Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the bottom;</span> <span class="accented">the valley.</span> Myrtles love such places. "Amantes littora myrtos" (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 4:124). The term would suit the valley of the Kidron. Others render, "the shady place," or "the tabernacle," but not so appropriately. LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Alex., 860] <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "between the shady mountains." The Greek translators seem to have borrowed their reading from ch. 6, where the chariots issue from between two mountains of brass. <span class="cmt_word">Behind him were them red horses;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>  horses mounted by riders (ver. 11). Speckled. It is not clear what colour is meant by this word. The Revised Version gives <span class="accented">sorrel</span>; Wright, "bay or chestnut;" LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: "dapple-grey and spotted;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">varii.</span> The Septuagint Version is probably a double rendering. The word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-8.htm">Isaiah 16:8</a>, where it is applied to the tendrils of the vitae. What is intended by the different colours of the horses is a matter of great dispute, and cannot be known. There is some reason for considering that they represent the world powers at this particular period - the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greek; three of those concerning which Daniel prophesied; the fourth, the Roman, not having yet come in view. The notion of tutelary angels, presiding over countries, was familiar to the Hebrew mind (see <a href="../../par/daniel/10-12.htm">Daniel 10:12, 13, 20, 21</a>). These horsemen are evidently not post couriers, but warriors on military service. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-9.htm">Zechariah 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, O my lord, what <i>are</i> these?

Hence some regard the expression as intimating a communication berne inwardly to the soul without the aid of external organs, or that the angel overpowered and influenced the prophet as the evil spirit possessed the demoniac. But the same term is used, as Dr. Wright points out, in the sense of to commune with a person (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-39.htm">1 Samuel 25:39</a>), and to speak to a person (<a href="../../par/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>; and perhaps <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may, however, be that the angel of the Lord presented matters objectively, and the prophet's own angel interpreted subjectively.

There was no sign of that shaking of nations which Haggai (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7, 21, 22</a>) had foretold should precede the coming of Messiah and the restoration of Israel. In this second year of Darius, the empire, though suffering from internal disturbances, was outwardly at peace, and was threatened by no enemy at a distance. But the condition of the Jews was sad and disheartening; the temple still unbuilt, the walls of Jerusalem lying in ruins, themselves only a small remnant, exposed to the insults and attacks of jealous neighbours, living on sufferance as subjects of a heathen power, and no sign of the predicted salvation appearing, - this was their state.

The prophet had been told that the hostile nations should be punished and scattered; he now is shown this threat being executed. <span class="cmt_word">Four horns,</span> belching to four beasts but dimly seen or wholly invisible. Horns are symbols of strength and power (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/75-4.htm">Psalm 75:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>). Here they mean powers hostile to Israel, and the number "four" (the symbol of completeness) points to the four winds from which they come, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from every side. In the Hebrew ch. 2. begins at this verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What <i>be</i> these? And he answered me, These <i>are</i> the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which have scattered,</span> etc. Some see here an allusion to the prophecy of Daniel concerning the Babylonians, Medo-Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. Against this view it is urged that the prophet is speaking of past events, not of a far distant future. Others Lake the four horns to represent Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, and Medo-Persia, all of which had scattered Israel. But it is well to lay no special stress on such explanations of symbolical language, which are at best mere conjectures, liable to be overthrown by a new theory. The word "scattered," which Jerome renders <span class="accented">ventilaverunt</span>, means properly, as Wright observes, "to winnow," to separate and scatter by means of the wind. The perfect tense of this verb must not be pressed so as to exclude all notion of coming events. The prophets see at one glance past and future, and combine in one expression far distant occurrences. Doubtless Zechariah's vision has some relation to  Daniel's, and his description of the powers hostile to the Church of God runs on parallel lines with that of his predecessor. Whether be refers to the same four empires must be left in uncertainty. <span class="cmt_word">Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem</span>. All the tribes and the capital. According to Ewald, Judah is named first as occupying the place of honour, even as Benjamin is named before Judah in <a href="../../par/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>, because the capital city lay in its territory. Jerusalem was the centre of worship and government for all the people, the northern tribes being represented by Israel. the southern by Judah. Some critics cancel the word "Israel" here, and there is no doubt that it is often written for "Jerusalem" by mistake (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> [where see Professor Cheyne's note]; 32:30, 32; 51:49; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>). Gratz supposes that in the present passage the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word "Jerusalem" after the wrong one "Israel," but leaving the latter still in the manuscript. Of course, there is no proof of this supposition. Some manuscripts of the Septuagint omit "Jerusalem" here.

We shall be safer if we look upon them merely as God's instruments and servants without further identification.

Consequent on the destruction of enemies shall be the growth and development of the chosen people till the time of their final glory (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>). There is some difficulty in arranging the details of this vision, depending in great measure on the decision we arrive at with regard to the  identification of the "young man" of ver. 4. Those who, as Theodoret, Hitzig, Schegg, Trcehon, Wright, Perowne, etc., consider him to be the man with the measuring line of ver. 1, do not explain why the message should be given to him instead of to the prophet who had asked for information. Nor is it at all certain that the measurer is meant to be regarded as having made a mistake in attempting to define the limits of what was practically unlimited - viz. the restored Jerusalem - and was stopped accordingly in his proceedings. It seems preferable, with Jerome, Cornelius a Lapide, Pusey, Keil, Knabenbauer, etc., to regard the "young man" as Zechariah himself. Then the vision is thus presented: The prophet sees a man with a measuring line; he asks whither he is going, and is answered that he was going forth to measure Jerusalem. Upon this the interpreting angel leaves the prophet's side to receive the explanation of the man's proceedings, and is met by a superior angel, who bids him hasten to tell the prophet the meaning of the vision. <span class="cmt_word">A man.</span> Probably an angel in human form, as <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A measuring line.</span> This is not the same word as that in <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; but the idea there proposed is taken up here, and its fulfilment is set forth (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15, 16</a>).

The idea in the text is that Jerusalem in the future shall be so extended that walls shall no longer contain its inhabitants, but they shall spread themselves in the open country on every side. It is certain that the city did greatly increase in after time, if we may believe Aristeas's account in his famous letter to his brother Philocrates; and the annunciation of this prosperity would be a comfort to the prophet (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). But no material increase of this nature satisfies the prophecy, which can only have its fulfilment in the spiritual Jerusalem, whose Builder is Christ, in whose light the nations of them that are saved shall walk (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>; see <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, etc.; Isaiah 54:2, 3).

He calls on all the Hebrews still in dispersion to come and share this glorious state and escape the punishment which was about to fall upon the hostile kingdom. The exaltation of Jerusalem is connected with the downfall of her enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Ho, ho, come forth, and flee;</span> Hebrew, "Ho, ho I and flee," or, "flee thou" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/48-20.htm">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-6.htm">Jeremiah 51:6, 45</a>.) A great number of the exiles had remained in Babylonia, having established themselves there, according to the injunction in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-5.htm">Jeremiah 29:5</a>, etc., and grown rich. These people had refused to exchange their present prosperity for the doubtful future offered by a return to their desolate native land. But they are now called upon to "flee" from the danger that menaced the country of their adoption. Babylon is said to have been twice taken in the reign of Darius (see note on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the north;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>  Babylonia (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-8.htm">Jeremiah 23:8</a>). We should have nailed the Babylonians an Eastern people if we had dwelt in Palestine; but they always invaded this land from the north, and the great caravan route entered the country from the same quarter, so they were deemed to he a northern power. <span class="cmt_word">I have spread you abroad as the four winds</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>). The Jews had been dispersed through all parts of the extensive Babylonian empire, and that with a violence which is compared to the force of the combined winds of heaven. Keil, Wright, and others regard the words as a promise of future extension only to be obtained by a return to the promised land, translating, "I will spread you," the perfect of the text being taken to express prophetic certainty. But it is surely incongruous to comfort the dispersed Jews by the promise of a still wider dispersion. This appears to be as erroneous as the Septuagint rendering of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3c9;</span>, "I will gather."

There is soma reproach implied in the clause, as if these Jews were content to dwell and remain in this heathen city. The immediate danger that menaced Babylon arose from two severe rebellions, in the course of which the city was twice taken. The first revolt was headed by Nidinta-Bel,  <span class="date">B.C. 519</span>, who was slain by Darius at Babylon. The second took place under Arakha,  <span class="date">B.C. 514</span>; he was defeated by a general of Darius, named Intaphernes, taken prisoner and crucified. A record of these occurrences is found in Darius's inscription on the rock at Behlstun, translated in 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. The merciless Persians would doubtless treat the inhabitants of the captured city with their wonted cruelty.

Some suppose that it was the interpreting angel who showed this vision; but his duty was to explain, not to present, the visions. So in <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-20.htm">Zechariah 1:20</a> it is the Lord who shows the "four craftsmen." This vision is closely connected with the last. In that it was declared that the Lord would again dwell in Jerusalem, and visit his people with blessings. But to fit them for the presence and favour of Jehovah they must be pure. To this end they must have a holy priesthood to train them in righteous ways, to oppose the attacks of the adversary, and to intercede for them effectually. The removal of their impurity is represented in the fourth vision. <span class="cmt_word">Joshua the high priest</span> (see note on Haggai 1:1). The name is written Joshua in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>, etc. He was the first of the high priests after the Captivity, succeeding, as by hereditary right, his father Josedech, who died in Babylon. For his services in restoring the temple he is praised among great men in Ecclus. 49:12. <span class="cmt_word">Standing before the angel of the Lord</span>. Joshua is the representative of the priesthoood, and through that also of the whole people. The angel of Jehovah (see notes on Zechariah 1:11, 13) is the representative of and endowed with attributes of Jehovah, the Friend and Leader  of Israel. The phrase, "standing before," is used in a ministerial sense, as of a servant rendering service to a superior (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-6.htm">1 Kings 12:6, 8</a>), and a priest or Levite performing his official duties (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>) : also, in a judicial sense, of a person appearing before a judge, either as plaintiff (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-2.htm">Numbers 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16</a>) or defendant (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Many commentators find in this scene a judicial process, Joshua appearing before the angel as before his judge; and Ewald supposes that it adumbrates his actual accusation at the Persian court, The mention of the adversary at the right hand (<a href="../../par/psalms/109-6.htm">Psalm 109:6</a>) is supposed to confirm this interpretation. But it is obvious that the adversary might stand at the right hand, not as a formal accuser in a trial, but in order to resist and hinder Joshua's proceedings; the angel, too, is not represented as sitting on a throne of judgment, but standing by (ver. 5), and there is no further intimation of any judicial process in the vision. It is therefore best to conceive that Joshua is interceding for the people in his official capacity in the presence of the representative of Jehovah. The locality is not specified; it may have been before the altar, which, we know, was built and used at this time. The special mention of his garments implies that he was engaged in official duties in a consecrated spot; but the place is immaterial. <span class="cmt_word">Satan</span>; <span class="accented">the adversary</span>, or <span class="accented">accuser</span>. The personality of Satan is here plainly recognized, as in <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>, etc.; Job 2:1, etc., rendered by the LXX. in all these places, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (see Appendix B, in Archdeacon Perowne's 'Commentary on Zechariah'). <span class="cmt_word">At his</span> (Joshua's) <span class="cmt_word">right hand.</span> Not as a judicial accuser, but as an enemy to resist his efforts for the good of the people, and to thwart his interests with the angel of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">To resist him;</span> <span class="accented">to act the adversary to him.</span> The verb is cognate to, the noun above. From what follows we must suppose that Satan objects against Joshua both his own personal sin and the transgressions of the people whose burden he bore (comp. ver. 9, where his sin is called "the iniquity of the land," which would include the guilt which had led to the Captivity, their dilatoriness in building the temple, and all their backslidings since the return). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: <i>is</i> not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said.</span> The Angel of Jehovah speaks.

Some commentators have supposed that St. Jude is alluding to this passage when (ver. 9) he quotes the words of Michael contending about the body of Moses, "The Lord rebuke thee:" but it is more probable that Jude is referring to some rabbinical tradition, or to the apocryphal 'Assumption of Moses' (see the matter examined in Dissertation I. of Dr. Gloag's 'Introduction to the Catholic Epistles'). <span class="cmt_word">That hath chosen Jerusalem (</span><a href="../../par/zechariah/1-17.htm">Zechariah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-12.htm">Zechariah 2:12</a>). God's election of Israel and renewed acceptance of her is the reason why Satan's accusation is rejected (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7, 8</a>). She is not to be abandoned to the consequences of her sins, nor were God's gracious purposes towards her to be frustrated. "God hath not cast away his people, which he foreknew;" and, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This</span>.

From these evils, which had almost destroyed her, she had been delivered; and the deliverance would be completed; she should not be cast again into the fire (see <a href="../../par/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>, and note there).

But the sin was not only personal; he appeared laden with the guilt of the priesthood and his people. He is a type of Christ in this. Christ, indeed, was without sin; yet he bare our sins in his own body on the tree, and was made sin for us (<a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>). Some consider that the soiled garments denote the mean address in which an accused person appeared in court. But this is to import a Roman custom (comp. Livy, 2:54; 6:20) into Hebrew practice. Others deem it incongruous to make a high priest violate the decency of his office by officiating in unclean apparel. But the violation of propriety was a requirement of the vision, that thus the defilement of sin might be symbolical. <span class="cmt_word">He stood before the angel.</span> To ask his aid and protection (ver. 4).

They are used here as symbols of righteousness and glory. Not only is the sin pardoned, but the wearer is restored to the full glory of his state. The LXX. makes the words to be addressed to the attendants, "Clothe ye him in a robe flowing to the feet" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>, the word used for Aaron's priestly garment, <a href="../../par/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>; Ecclus. 45:8).

The LXX. omits the word, continuing the address to the attendant. The Vulgate has, <span class="accented">et dixit.</span> So the Syriac and the Targum and some few manuscripts. But the received reading is confirmed, as Dr. Alexander points out, by the change in the mood of the following verb from the imperative to the optative, "let them put," "would that they put." There is nothing incongruous in the prophet thus intervening in his own person. Thus Isaiah, in the midst of a solemn vision, gives vent to his feelings (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>), and St. John in the Apocalypse often mingles his own sentiments and actions with what he beheld (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/5-4.htm">Revelation 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mitre</span> (<span class="accented">tsaniph</span>); Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cidarim.</span> This is not the same word as that used in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>, etc. (which is <span class="accented">mitsnepheth</span>), for the official head dress of Aaron, though it is probably a synonym for it; and the prophet's wish is to see Joshua not only reinstated in his office and dignity, but found holy also. For the fair linen mitre, or tiara, was that which bore upon its front the golden plate inscribed, "Holiness unto the Lord" (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-36.htm">Exodus 28:36-38</a>), and therefore showed that he was qualified to intercede for the people. <span class="cmt_word">Stood by.</span> The Angel of Jehovah continued standing in his place, contemplating, sanctioning, and directing what was being done.

The charge means the laws and ordinances of the Mosaic institution. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. The apodosis rightly begins here, though Kimchi and others make it commence at "I will give thee," taking the following two clauses as denoting parts of his duties, the observance of which conditioned his acceptance. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt also judge my house.</span> The mention of "my courts" in the following clause requires that "house" here should mean, not people or family, but, in a more restricted sense, the temple, looked upon as the spiritual centre of the nation. If the high priest kept the ordinances and commandments, he should rule and order Divine worship, and "judge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> govern, the ministers of the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_word">Keep my courts.</span> He was to preserve the temple, and that which the temple represented, from all idolatry and ungodliness. This duty, as Hengstenberg observes, is introduced as a reward, because it was an honour and a privilege to be entrusted with such an office, and the greatest favour which God could confer upon man. <span class="cmt_word">Places to walk.</span> The LXX. takes the word as a participle, translating, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, "persons walking;" so the Syriac; Vulgate, <span class="accented">ambulantes.</span> This is explained to mean that God will give him out of the band of angels (ver. 4), some to accompany and aid him in his ministrationS. But the word is best taken as a noun meaning "walks," "goings." The Revised Version gives, "a place of access" in the text, restoring the Authorized Version in the margin; but there seems to be no good reason for the Revised rendering. The translation, "goings," "walks," gives much the same signification, and is consonant with the use of the word elsewhere (comp. <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-6.htm">Nehemiah 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/3-9.htm">Jonah 3:9, 4</a>). It means that Joshua should have free access to God. The gloss of the Targum, that it is here intimated that the high priest should be admitted to the company of the angels after the resurrection, is unsuitable, as the other parts of the promise have respect to this present world. <span class="cmt_word">Among these that stand by;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among the attendant angels who wait upon God to do his will, and a company of whom were gathered round the Angel of Jehovah in the vision (see ver. 4). It is natural piety to believe that the hosts of heaven join in the worship of the Church on earth, and assist godly ministers with  their presence and fellowship. Here is adumbrated that access to God which the Christian enjoys in Christ (<a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>). This is more fully revealed in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they <i>are</i> men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear now;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;</span> (Septuagint).

The word rendered "branch" (<span class="accented">tsemach</span>) is translated by the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used in the sense of "shoot" as well as "sunrise" (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-10.htm">Ezekiel 17:10</a>), and by the Vulgate, <span class="accented">orientem.</span> So the Syriac and Arabic (comp. <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>). Most interpreters rightly see here a reference to the Messiah. Some few have fancied that Zerubbabel and Nehemiah are meant; but the appellation, "my Servant Branch," has already been applied in prophetical language to Messiah, and cannot be distorted to any inferior subject, such as a mere civil ruler. Messiah is often called the Lord's "Servant," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>, etc. And the terms, "Branch," or "Rod," or "Shoot," referring to Messiah, are found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-2.htm">Isaiah 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>. From the depressed house of David a scion should spring, in whom all that was prophesied concerning the priesthood and kingdom of Israel should find its accomplishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone <i>shall be</i> seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For behold.</span> This gives the reason why the "Branch" is brought forth; the Church is to be firmly established and all iniquity to be abolished. <span class="cmt_word">The stone that I have laid</span> (set) <span class="cmt_word">before Joshua.</span> In the vision a stone is seen lying at the feet of Joshua, either the foundationstone of the temple, say the commentators, or the cornerstone, or the coping; or, as the Talmud testifies, a stone that rose some three fingers' measure above the ground, and upon which the high priest used to set the censer of incense. But it was more probably none of these, but some rough, unhewed block, not yet polished or fitted into its place. What does it represent? Many critics of note answer at once, the Messiah. He who was above called "Branch" is now called the "Stone." And certainly this term in applied unto him in prophetical language, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>; and references are made to the appellation is the New Testament as to a well known title, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/21-42.htm">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>. But there are objections to taking this as the primary sense. As Knabenbauer points out, it is not likely that in one verse the Lord's Servant Branch is said to be destined to be brought forth, and in the next the same is called the stone which is set before Joshua and has to be graven by a hand Divine. Besides, if both terms mean Messiah, we have the very lame conclusion: I will bring Messiah because I have already placed him before Joshua. The stone, too, is represented as somewhat under the management of Joshua, and needing graving and polishing, neither of which facts apply to the Messiah. Putting out of sight other interpretations which are all more or less inadmissible, we shall be safest in considering the stone to represent the theocracy, the spiritual kingdom of Israel, now indeed lying imperfect and unpolished before Joshua, but ordained to become beautiful and extensive and admirable. So Daniel (Daniel 2:35, 45) speaks of the stone cut out of the mountains without hands, which filled the whole earth, a figure of the Church and kingdom of God, small in its beginning, but in the end establishing its rule over the world. <span class="cmt_word">Upon one stone;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "upon the one stone." The stone is termed "one" in contrast with the number seven that follows. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be</span> (are) <span class="cmt_word">seven eyes.</span> Upon this stone the eyes of God are directed in watchful care (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and for the phrase, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-12.htm">Jeremiah 39:12</a>). "Seven" is the number of perfection, and may denote here the infinite care which God takes of his Church, even as St. John in the Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a>) beheld the Lamb "having seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth." The expression is metaphorical, and we are not to suppose, with Ewald, that the eyes were graven on the stone, or that Zechariah derived his notion from the tenets of Zoroaster or the degrees of rank in the Persian court. There may be an allusion to the seven gifts of the Spirit with which Messiah is anointed (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>), and which animate and strengthen his body, the Church. <span class="cmt_word">I will engrave the graving thereof.</span> As God engraved the tables of the Law  (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>). I will out and polish this rough stone to fit it for its place in the temple. The verb is used of the bold engraving and ornamentation of stonework, the finishing which it undergoes to perfect its preparation (comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-7.htm">2 Chronicles 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-7.htm">2 Chronicles 3:7</a>). Those who regard the stone as typifying the Messiah, see in this clause an intimation of the Passion of Christ, who "was wounded for our transgressions." The LXX. has, "I dig a trench," which Jerome explains of the wounds of Christ on the cross. <span class="cmt_word">I will remove the iniquity of that land.</span> The shaping of the stone involves the bestowal of purity and holiness. God will pardon the inhabitants of the land of Israel, and make them a holy nation (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7, 8</a>). But the promise stretches far beyond the limits primarily assigned to it. <span class="cmt_word">In one day.</span> The day when Christ died for the sins of men. There is an allusion to the great Day of Atonement, when the high priest went once a year into the holy of holies with the blood of sacrifice. This, however, was an imperfect reconciliation, and had to be repeated annually. "But Christ being come an High Priest of the good things to come...  through his own blood entered in once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption Now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-26</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).

(For a similar picture of prosperity, see <a href="../../par/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>, and note there.) This is fulfilled in Christ, who says to his true disciples, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you" (<a href="../../par/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>). Dr. Wright notes, "We are told in the Talmud ('Yoma,' 7:4) that when, on the great Day of Atonement, the high priest had performed the various duties of that solemn day, he was escorted home in a festive manner, and was accustomed to give a festal entertainment to his friends. The maidens and youths of the people went forth to their gardens and vineyards with songs and dances; social entertainments took place on all sides, and universal gladness closed the festival of that solemn day." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/zechariah/4.htm"><title>Zechariah 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/zechariah/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/zechariah/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/zechariah/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../zechariah/3.htm" title="Zechariah 3">&#9668;</a> Zechariah 4 <a href="../zechariah/5.htm" title="Zechariah 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - 7. <span class="accented">The fifth vision: the golden candlestick.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel that talked with me.</span> The interpreting angel is meant. <span class="cmt_word">Came again, and waked me.</span> It is thought that the angel, who is said (<a href="../../par/zechariah/2-3.htm">Zechariah 2:3</a>) to have gone forth, now rejoined the prophet and renewed his colloquy with him. But the expression in the text is probably only equivalent to "aroused me again" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a>, etc.). Absorbed in awe and wonder at the contemplation of the preceding vision, the prophet had fallen into a state of exhaustion and torpor, as Daniel slept after his great visions (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8, 9</a>), and the apostles were heavy with sleep on the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). From this mental prostration the angel arouses him to renewed attention. Or what is meant may be that the change wrought on the faculties by the Divine influence was as great as that between natural sleeping and waking. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/4-2.htm">Zechariah 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto me, What seest thou?

This vision of the candlestick, with its seven lamps fed by two olive trees, signifies that the work of rebuilding the temple, and preparing the way for the Church of the true Israel, was to be accomplished by relying, not on human resources, but on Divine aid. Thus were Zerubbabel and his people roused to perseverance and energy in their good work, of which the final sucess is assured. <span class="cmt_word">I have looked;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> (Septuagint), "I have seen." <span class="cmt_word">A candlestick all of gold</span>. The candelabrum as described differs in some particulars from that in the tabernacle, though the same word<span class="accented">, menorath</span>, is used in both cases (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-17.htm">Exodus 37:17</a>, etc.). In Solomon's temple there were ten candelabra (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-49.htm">1 Kings 7:49</a>), which were carried away to Babylon when Jerusalem was taken (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-19.htm">Jeremiah 52:19</a>). The single candelabrum of Zerubbabel's temple is mentioned in 1 Macc. 1:21 1 Macc. 4:49, 50. The one sculptured on the arch of Titus may be a truthful representation of that in Herod's temple, but probably is not the same as that in the second edifice (comp. Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:04, 4). The candelabrum in the vision differed from the original one in three particulars: it had a central reservoir; it had also seven pipes; and it was supplied with oil by two olive trees. <span class="cmt_word">With a</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>) <span class="cmt_word">howl upon the top of it.</span> The "bowl" (<span class="accented">gullah</span>) is a reservoir for oil placed at the top of the candelabrum; and from it tubes led the oil for the supply of the lamps. In the tabernacle each lamp was separate, and trimmed and filled by the ministering priests; the mystic lamps needed no human agency to keep them supplied. They were fed by the "bowl." The word is translated in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">lampas</span>; hence some have supposed that, besides the seven lamps, there was another large light in the centre; but the Greek and Latin rendering is mistaken, the word meaning "a fountain" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>), or "a ball" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-41.htm">1 Kings 7:41</a>), or "a round bowl" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof.</span> The Hebrew is, literally rendered, <span class="accented">seven and seven pipes to the lamps which are upon its top.</span> The LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "And seven vessels for the lamps which are upon it;" so the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Septem infusoria lucernis, quae erant super caput ejus</span>. These versions imply that there was one supply pipe to each of the lamps, which seems most natural. In this case, the first "seven" in the text must be an interpolation. Commentators who regard the present reading as correct have taken various ways in explaining it. Some multiply the number into itself, and make the pipes forty-nine; but this is unwarranted by Hebrew usage (Henderson). Others add the numbers together, making fourteen; but here again the copulative <span class="accented">vau</span>, which implies diversity, is an objection. The Revised Version has, "There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, taking the words distributively; but the number of tubes seems here to be unnecessarily large. Dr. Wright considers that there were two pipes to each lamp, one set connecting each to the central bowl, and one connecting the several lamps together. One, however, does not see of what particular use the second set is. Dr. Wright, p. 84, gives a drawing of the candelabrum with  its appurtenances, according to his notion of the vision. The Authorized Version seems to give the correct idea of the passage, whether we arrive at it by rejecting the first "seven," or by considering that it is repeated for emphasis' sake, as Cornelius Lapide and Pressel think: "Seven are the lamps upon it - seven, I say, and seven the pipes." Take it as we may, the point is that the oil is well and copiously supplied to the several lights.

The word is almost synonymous with the following, translated <span class="cmt_word">power</span>; and the two together mean that the effect is to be produced, not by any human means, however potent. Doubtless Zerubbabel was dispirited when he thought how much there was to do, how feeble the means at his disposal (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-2.htm">Nehemiah 4:2</a>), and how formidable the opposition; and nothing could better reassure him than the promise of Divine aid. <span class="cmt_word">But by my Spirit.</span> The angel does not say expressly what is to be done; but the purpose that filled the minds of Zechariah and Zerubbabel applied the word. The operations of the Spirit are manifold, and his aid alone could bring these mighty things to pass.

He shall commence and put the finishing stroke to the work of rebuilding the temple. Many commentators take this stone to be the one that completes the building, "the topstone." But it may well be questioned whether a building like the temple could have any such stone. An arch or a pyramid may have a crowning stone, but no other edifice; nor is there any proof that such a topstone was known or its erection celebrated. It may be a mere metaphor for the completion of the work. It is better, however, to take it as the cornerstone, to which we know great importance was attached (comp. <a href="../../par/job/38-6.htm">Job 38:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/118-22.htm">Psalm 118:22</a>, etc.). This stone, on which the building rests, Zerubbabel will bring forth from the workshop; as the next verses say, his hands have laid the foundation. That action, already past, is represented as future, the regular commencement of the work under Zerubbabel's direction being intimated, and its happy conclusion promised. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "And I will bring forth the stone of the inheritance" - the meaning of which is obscure, though Jerome explains it by considering it an allusion to Christ.

The Targum recognizes here a Messianic prophecy: "He will reveal the Messiah whose Name is spoken of from all eternity, and he shall rule over all the kingdoms."

Small as the present work was, it was a pledge of the full completion, and was therefore not to be despised. So the question is equivalent to, "Can any one, after these promises and prophecies, presume to be doubtful about the future?" <span class="cmt_word">For they shall rejoice</span>, etc. The subject of the verbs is that which comes last in position, the seven eyes of Jehovah; and the verse is best translated thus: "For (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> seeing that) these seven eyes of Jehovah, which run through all the earth, behold with joy the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel." The work is not contemptible, since the Lord regards it with favour, watches, and directs it. The LXX. and Vulgate (followed nearly by the Authorized Version) make the despisers the subject of the verbs, and lamely dissociate the final clause entirely from the preceding.

Tin is not found in Palestine; it was imported by the Phoenicians in great abundance, and from them the Jews obtained it. The supply must have come from Spain or Britain.

It should be, "even these seven," explaining who are "they" at the head of the clause. <span class="cmt_word">The eyes of the Lord.</span> The "seven eyes" have been already mentioned (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>, where see note). They are expressive of God's watchful providence and care. Which run to and fro. This clause further enforces the previous image (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).

By them are intended the two powers, the regal and the sacerdotal, through which God's help and protection are dispensed to the theocracy. Oil was used in appointing to both these offices (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). The expression, "son of," in many cases denotes a quality or property, like "son of Belial," "son of might;" so here Dr. Alexander considers that "sons of oil" means people possessed of oil, oil bearers, channels through which the oil flowed to others. Zerubbabel and Joshua are representatives of the civil and priestly authorities, but the text seems expressly to avoid naming any human agents, in order to show that the symbol must not be limited to individuals. Nor, indeed, must it be confined to the Jewish Church and state; it looks forward to the time when Jew and Gentile shall unite in  upholding the Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">That stand by the Lord of the whole earth;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> ready as his ministers to do him service. There is a reference to this passage in <a href="../../par/revelation/11-4.htm">Revelation 11:4</a>, where the "two witnesses" are called "the two olive trees.., standing Before the Lord of the earth" (Perowne). The vision, as we have seen, prefigures primarily the completion of the temple and the restoration of its worship, and secondly the establishment of the Christian Church by the advent of Messiah. The several parts of the vision may be thus explained. The candelabrum is a symbol of the Jewish Church and theocracy, in accordance with the imagery in the Apocalypse, where the seven candlesticks are seven Churches (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>). It is made of gold as precious in God's sight, and to be kept pure and unalloyed; it is placed in the sanctuary, and has seven lamps, to indicate that it is bright with the grace of God, and is meant to shed its light around at all times, as Christian men are bidden to shine like lights in the world (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The oil that supplies the lamps is the grace of God, the influence of the Holy Spirit, which alone enables the Church to shine and to accomplish its appointed work. The two olive trees are the two authorities, viz. the civil and sacerdotal, through which God communicates his grace to the Church; these stand by the Lord Because, instituted by him, they carry out his will in the ordering, guiding, extending, and purifying his kingdom among men. The two olive branches remit their oil into one receptacle, because the two authorities, the regal and priestly, are intimately connected and united, and their action tends to one end, the promotion of God's glory in the salvation of men. In Messiah these offices are united; he is the channel of Divine grace, the source of light to the whole world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/zechariah/5.htm"><title>Zechariah 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/zechariah/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/zechariah/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/zechariah/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../zechariah/4.htm" title="Zechariah 4">&#9668;</a> Zechariah 5 <a href="../zechariah/6.htm" title="Zechariah 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - &sect; 8. <span class="accented">The sixth vision</span>: <span class="accented">the flying roll</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I lifted up mine eyes again, and saw the vision that follows.

The Hebrews used parchment and leather scrolls for writing; the writing was divided into columns, and when completed the document was rolled round one or two sticks and kept in a case. In the present vision the scroll is unrolled and exhibited in its full length and breadth, showing that it was to be made known to all. Its flight denotes the speedy arrival of the judgment, and, as it is seen in the heaven, so the punishment proceeds from God. Theodotion and Aquila render the word, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, "leather;" the Septuagint, by mistake, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "a sickle."

The dimensions given correspond to those of the porch of Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>), twenty cubits long by ten broad. These are also the dimensions of the holy place in the tabernacle, and of Solomon's brazen altar (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>). The careful statement of the size of the roll indicates that some special meaning is attached to these measurements. We do not know that any symbolical signification was recognized in the porch of the temple; but these dimensions may well contain a reference to the sanctuary and the altar, as Knabenbauer explains, "The curse is of the same measure as that altar which was the instrument of expiation and reconciliation, and as that sanctuary which was the entrance to the holy of holies." Others consider that the curse is pronounced according to the measure of the sanctuary, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to the Divine Law; or that all might thus know that it came from God, and that the possession of the temple did not secure the people from vengeance unless they were pure and obedient.

Perjury is a chief offence in one table of the Law, theft in the other; so these sins may stand for all offences against the Decalogue (comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, etc.). But probably they are named because they were particularly rife among the returned Jews. Daring their long sojourn in Babylon they had engaged in commercial pursuits and had fallen into the lax morality which such occupations often engender. These bad habits they had brought with them and practised in their new home (comp. ch. 8:17, and note there). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be out off as on this side according to it;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">shall be purged out on the one side</span> (margin, <span class="accented">from hence</span>) <span class="accented">according to it</span>; Ewald, "driven hence like it."

The ephah was the largest of the dry measures in use among the Jews, and was equal to six or seven gallons. It was, of course, too small to contain a woman. The LXX. calls it simply "the measure;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">amphora</span>; and it must be considered as an imaginary vessel of huge size. It may have a tacit reference to dishonest dealings (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-10.htm">Micah 6:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">This is their resemblance;</span> literally, <span class="accented">this is their eye</span>. The Authorized Version explains the meaning accurately. "Eye" is often used for that which is seen, as in <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-55.htm">Leviticus 13:55</a>, where the Authorized Version has "colour;" and <a href="../../par/numbers/11-7.htm">Numbers 11:7</a>, where in reference to the manna we read, "The eve thereof was as the eye of bdellium" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 16</a>). So here the meaning is: This ephah and this whole vision represent the wicked in the land. Some take "the eye" to mean the object of sight, that to which they look. But the ephah was not sot forth for all the people to examine. The LXX. and Syriac, from some variation in the reading, have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "iniquity," and some critics have desired to adopt this in the text.

It is used in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10, 12</a>, for the tract of country of which the Jordan was the centre, and in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a> for a round loaf.

It is very common to find backsliding Israel represented as a faithless and adulterous woman (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; and the parable of the two women in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">He cast it;</span> <span class="accented">her</span> - the woman. As the woman rose, or tried to rise, from the ephah, the angel flung her down into it. It is possible, as some commentators suppose, that the ephah into which wickedness is thrust represents the measure of iniquity which, being reached, constrains God to punish (see <a href="../../par/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where the dispossession of the Amorites is postponed till their iniquity is full). <span class="cmt_word">The weight of lead;</span> literally, as the LXX., <span class="accented">the stone of lead</span>; Vulgate<span class="accented">, massam plumbeam.</span> This is the cover of the ephah, that which is called the "talent of lead" in the preceding verse. This heavy cover the angel cast upon the mouth of the ephah, in order to confine the woman therein (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>, which passage may explain why the cover is called "a stone"). Dr. Wright and some other commentators, referring the passage to theft and perjury alone, consider that the woman held in her hand the leaden weight with which she weighed her gains, and was sitting in the ephah which she used in her traffic; so that she represents dishonesty in the matter of weight and measure. She is punished by the means of the instruments she had used unrighteously; the weight is dashed upon her lying mouth, and the ephah, her throne, is made the vehicle that carries her out of the land. But it seems a mistake to confine the iniquity mentioned to the two special sins of theft and perjury; nor would the talent and the ephah be natural instruments of stealing and false swearing; and the point of the vision is not the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the land. It is true that the pronominal suffix in the mouth thereof is feminine, and that the LXX. makes it refer to the woman, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>.

This latter supposition proceeds on the erroneous idea that wickedness is herein rescued from punishment, whereas the notion that underlies the whole vision is that the Holy Land is purged of wickedness. That the two nations hostile to Israel are represented is an untenable suggestion; for why should they carry off iniquity from Jerusalem and fix it in their own land? Probably by the two women carrying away the evil woman is signified (if the details are capable of explanation) that iniquity brings with it its own destruction and works out its own removal. <span class="cmt_word">The wind was in their wings.</span> They were borne  along so quickly that they seemed to be carried by the wind; or the wind helped their flight. <span class="cmt_word">A stork;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "the hoopoe;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">milvi.</span> The Authorized Version is certainly correct. The stork is common enough in Palestine, and is reckoned among unclean birds in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-19.htm">Leviticus 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-18.htm">Deuteronomy 14:18</a>), for which cause some have thought it is here introduced as bearing the sin laden ephah. But its introduction more probably has reference to its migratory habits, the power and rapidity of its flight, and, as some think, to its skill in constructing its nest.

Thus from the spiritual Zion all wickedness shall be abolished (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>) and sent to its own place prepared for the enemies of God and holiness. Doubtless, too, a warning is here conveyed to those Jews who still lingered in Babylon, that they were dwelling in a land accursed of God, and were liable to be involved in the fate which pursues ungodliness. Orelli and some others see in these two visions an analogy to the two goats on the Day of Atonement, of which one was sacrificed for the sins of the people, and the other bore away their iniquity to the demons' abode, the wilderness (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/zechariah/6.htm"><title>Zechariah 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/zechariah/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/zechariah/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/zechariah/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../zechariah/5.htm" title="Zechariah 5">&#9668;</a> Zechariah 6 <a href="../zechariah/7.htm" title="Zechariah 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains <i>were</i> mountains of brass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - &sect; 10. <span class="accented">The eighth vision: the four chariots.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I turned, and lifted up mine eyes</span> (see note on Zechariah 5:1). <span class="cmt_word">Four chariots.</span> These are war chariots. The angel explains, in vers. 5, etc., what these chariots mean, how that they represent God's judgments on sinners in all the world. Though evil is removed from the Church, God's vengeance pursues it wherever it is located. If we compare this vision with the first (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>), we shall see that the quiet there spoken of is here broken, and that the shaking of the nations, which is to accompany Messiah's advent (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>), has begun. That the four chariots are to be identified with the four powers of Daniel's visions (2 and 7.) - the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Macedonian, and Roman - is an opinion that does not commend itself. These four kingdoms and their fate have been already symbolized in the horns of the second vision (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19-21</a>), and it is most unlikely that they should be again introduced under a different figure. This would mar the orderly development of the revelation. And how could these kingdoms, such as they were, be said to issue from the seat of the theocracy and to be attentive to God's commands? Further, how could the chariots symbolize the kingdoms which were to be the objects of punishment, when at the same time they are themselves the instruments which inflict the chastisement? Neither does the angel's explanation suit this notion; for kingdoms are nowhere found under the figure of winds, and such a symbol would have been unintelligible to the prophet without further elucidation. <span class="cmt_word">Two mountains.</span> The Hebrew has the article, "the two mountains," two well known mountains. The scene of the vision is Jerusalem or its neighbourhood; hence the two mountains mentioned are thought to he those of Zion or the temple mount, and Olives (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>). It is impossible to identify them; end probably nothing more is meant than that the chariots came forth from a defile between the two mountains which appeared in the vision. <span class="cmt_word">Mountains of brass;</span> or, <span class="accented">copper</span>. These impregnable, undecaying mountains represent the immovable, invincible nature of the theocracy and of God's decrees respecting it. From it the chariots go forth, because for the sake of God's kingdom and to promote its objects the world powers are destroyed (Knabenbauer) (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>). The number "four" represents completeness; the judgment shall leave no quarter unvisited.

The colours of the horses are significant, though the symbols are not undisputed. "Red" symbolizes bloodshed and war (<a href="../../par/isaiah/63-2.htm">Isaiah 63:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-4.htm">Revelation 6:4</a>); "black," sorrow and mourning (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-28.htm">Jeremiah 4:28</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5</a>); "white," victory and joy (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>).

But <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is explained by the Scholiast in Aristophanes, 'Nub.,' 1225, as "swift;" and possibly the LXX. used it in that sense here.

The word <span class="accented">beruddim</span>, "speckled," occurs only in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 12</a>, where it has no symbolical character. As it denotes a combination of colours, probably spots of white on a dark ground, it may signify a quality of a mixed, nature, thus indicating a visitation of war and pestilence, the sword and famine.

It was a familiar symbol to the Jews. The winds are often introduced in executing God's will on sinners (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-36.htm">Jeremiah 49:36</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which go forth from standing before the Lord</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/job/2-1.htm">Job 2:1</a>). The winds are supposed to be God's servants, waiting his pleasure to be sent forth on his errands. The Septuagint and Vulgate translate, "which go forth to stand before the Lord." This denotes merely their usual obedience; but the text implies that the prophet sees them moving from their usual expectant attitude, and hastening forth to do God's commands. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a></div><div class="verse">The black horses which <i>are</i> therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward the south country.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The angel now (vers. 6, 7) indicates the various destinations of the chariots, except the first with the red horses. Why this is omitted has never been satisfactorily explained. Some regard ver. 7 as giving the destination of this chariot, by making a  slight change in the word rendered "bay" in the Authorized Version, which would cause it to mean "red." The Syriac, indeed, which omits the word in ver. 3, translates it here by "red." If we retain the Masoretic reading, we must let this difficulty remain unsolved, and suppose that the angel explains only part of the vision, leaving the rest for the prophet's meditation. <span class="cmt_word">The black horses which are therein;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that wherein are the black horses, they go forth</span>, etc.; which is equivalent to "the chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth."

One chariot only is seen to go towards it, drawn by the speckled horses that denote a mixed judgment, perhaps of war and pestilence (see on ver. 3). The north and south symbolize the whole earth and the powers hostile to the true Israel.

However  unwilling the Jews were to let the Samaritans take part in the good work, they were quite ready to receive contributions from their brethren in the dispersion, and likewise from heathen kings and princes (see <a href="../../par/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a>, etc.; Ezra 7:15, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Make crowns.</span> The prophet was to get the crowns made (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). The plural may here be used intensively for "a noble crown," as in <a href="../../par/job/31-36.htm">Job 31:36</a>; or it may signify the two metals of which the crown was made, two or more wreaths being intertwined to form it. It is certain that only one crown was to be made, and that that was to be placed on Joshua's head. There is no mention of Zerubbabel in the passage; so the plural cannot be taken to intimate that there was a crown for the high priest and a crown for the princely ruler, as Ewald and Bunsen assert. These critics, followed by Hitzig and Wellhausen, supply the passage thus: "on the head of Zerubbabel and on the head of Joshua." Zerubbabel had no kingly position. Rather, all mention of Zerubbabel is expressly excluded, in order to denote that in the Person of him whom Joshua symbolized, the offices of priest and king were united (<a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>). We may note that in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a> Christ is said to have on his head many crowns, by which is meant a diadem composed of many circlets. The high priest's mitre is never called a crown. That which was placed on Joshua's head was a royal crown, a token of royal dignity, not his own, but his whom he represented - Christ the eternal Priest, the universal King.

But them is no need to alter the rendering of the Authorized Version, which indicates that the shoot shall grow from its own soil, that Messiah shall arise in his own country and nation, and shall spring from a lowly origin to the highest glory (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall build the temple of the Lord.</span> He should build, not the material temple whose foundations Zerubbabel had laid, but the spiritual temple of which the tabernacle and the temple of Jerusalem were only the type and shadow - that new sanctuary which Ezekiel beheld (41), a house not made with hands, the Church of the living God (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>).

The Authorized Version is doubtless correct, as the clause is intended to declare that Messiah should, like Melchizedek, combine the offices of Priest and King (<a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-6.htm">Hebrews 5:6, 10</a>). The counsel of peace shall be between them both. The two offices or dignities are meant, which are combined in one person. The Messiah, in his two offices of Priest and King, has one common design, to bring peace to his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-5.htm">Micah 5:5</a>, where see note). Other interpretations are unsuitable. Thus: There shall be harmony between Joshua and Zerubbabel; but the two are nowhere mentioned together in the paragraph, and, indeed, the statement would be superfluous. There shall be perfect concord between the two offices; but a person is spoken cf. not an abstraction. Others explain the "counsel of peace" to be between Jews and Gentiles, or the returned and the exiled Jews; but neither of these have been named. Pusey takes it to mean, "between the Father and the Son;" but there is nothing in the passage to lead to this. Kuabenhauer expounds it of those who alone are mentioned in the text, Messiah and Joshua, seeing in it an exhortation to the latter to make the type correspond to the Antitype, so that all may see that there is perfect harmony between them.

The only fast-day enjoined by the Law of Moses was the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month, Ethanim (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-26.htm">Leviticus 23:26</a>, etc.). But the Jews added others in memory of certain national events (see <a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-6.htm">1 Samuel 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>, etc.). In <a href="../../par/zechariah/8-19.htm">Zechariah 8:19</a> mention is made of four extraordinary fasts instituted and observed during the Captivity, viz. on the ninth day of the fourth month, in memory of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; in the fifth month, in remembrance of the burning of the temple and city; in the seventh month, in consequence of the murder of Gedaliah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</a>); and in the tenth month, in memory of the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (see note on ch. 8:19). <span class="cmt_word">Separating myself.</span> Abstaining from food and pleasure. Vulgate, <span class="accented">vel sanctificare me debeo</span>, such separation or abstinence being regarded as a consecration to the Lord.

Or, more generally, all farming labours shall succeed and prosper. Jerome's paraphrase is, "There shall be universal peace and joy;" Septuagint," But I will show forth peace." Another way of understanding the words which has found much favour with modern commentators is to take the clause in apposition with the words immediately following; thus: "The seed (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> growth) of peace, the vine, shall give its fruit." But there is no especial reason why the vine should be called "the seed of peace." It is not peculiar among fruit trees for requiring a time of peace for its cultivation. And the term "seed" is very inappropriate to the vine, which was not raised from seed, but from cuttings and layers. Perowne also points out that such a rendering destroys the balance of the three following clauses, which explain and expand the general statement that agriculture shall prosper. Dr. Alexander takes "the seed of peace" to be that from which peace springs; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that peace should be radically established in the land, and from this fact the results following should ensue. This affords a very good sense; but it is probably a metaphor quite unintended by the prophet.

But the ideal intended is much more than this. Salvation, indeed, is of the Jews; it began to be announced at Jerusalem; it was preached by the Jewish apostles; its founder was of the seed of David.

Because Jehovah has his eye on men and on Israel. Septuagint, "because the Lord looketh upon men" (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; and ver. 8 below). We may then translate, "For to Jehovah is an eye over man," etc. He sees their evil doings and their oppression of Israel, and therefore the judgment falls upon them (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-19.htm">Jeremiah 32:19</a>). The Authorized Version intimates a conversion of the Gentiles, of which, however, the context says nothing: and there is no sense in saying that judgment shall fall upon a particular nation when, or because, the eyes of all men look to the Lord. Wright explains thus: When the wrath of God falls on Damascus, the eyes of the heathen, as well as those of Israel, will look to the Lord, and they will marvel at the judgment and the close fulfilment of the prediction. This would be a very sound and probable exposition of the passage if the expression, "the eye of man being towards Jehovah," can mean that man marvels at his doings. <span class="cmt_word">All the tribes of Israel.</span> God watches over them to guard them from evil (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/5-5.htm">Ezra 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-18.htm">Psalm 33:18</a>).

The Authorized Version probably means that Hamath shall be the companion of Damascus in punishment. (For Hamath, see note on Amos 6:2.) These Syrian towns, as well as those below in Phoenicia and Philistia, shall be visited, because they were all once included in the territory promised to Israel (see <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>l; <a href="../../par/numbers/34-2.htm">Numbers 34:2-12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>).

In spite of, or because of, its boasted wisdom, Tyre should suffer heavy punishment. The wisdom of Tyre is spoken of in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3, 4</a>.

The city was built partly on the mainland, and partly on an island nearly half a mile distant, which rose abruptly out of the water in rocky precipices, and was surrounded with walls a hundred and fifty feet high. The insular portion of the town was that which so long mocked the Macedonian's  utmost efforts, which were only successful when he had united the island to the mainland by erecting an enormous mole between them.

The LXX. translates, "shall smite into the sea." Zechariah seems here to have a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32</a>, "What city is like Tyres, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-4.htm">Ezekiel 26:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With fire</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/1-10.htm">Amos 1:10</a>).

Gath is omitted, as in <a href="../../par/amos/1-6.htm">Amos 1:6-8</a> and <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>:. It seems never to have recovered its destruction by Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>).

After the fall of Tyre, Alexander continued his march southwards towards Egypt, subduing the cities on his way.

Its governor, one Batis, a eunuch, was tied alive to the conqueror's chariot, and dragged round the walls, in cruel imitation of the fate of Hector. <span class="cmt_word">The king shall perish from Gaza.</span> No particular king is meant; but the prediction says that henceforward no king should reign in Gaze. In contrast with the Eastern policy of allowing conquered nations to retain their own rulers as tributary sovereigns, Alexander always deposed or slew reigning monarchs, and consolidated his empire by replacing them with governors of his own. The various chastisements are meted out by the prophet among the various cities, though they equally apply to all. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-6.htm">Zechariah 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A Bastard.</span> The word (<span class="accented">mamzer</span>)  occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a> (3, Hebrew), where it may possibly mean "a stranger." It is  generally considered to signify one whose birth has a blemish in it - one born of incest or adultery. In Deuteronomy the LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "one of harlot birth;" here, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "foreigner." The Vulgate has <span class="accented">separator</span>, which is explained as meaning either the Lord, who as Judge divides the just from the unjust, or the Conqueror, who divides the spoil and assigns to captives their fate. Here it doubtless signifies "a bastard race" (as the Revised Version margin translates); a rabble of aliens shall inhabit Ashdod, which shall lose its own native population. The Targum explains it differently, considering that by the expression is meant that Ashdod shall be inhabited by Israelites, who are deemed "strangers" by the Philistines. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdod</span> (see note on Amos 1:8). <span class="cmt_word">The pride.</span> All in which they prided themselves.

Sacrifices offered to idols, and afterwards eaten. The two clauses intimate the entire abolition of idolatry. Many see in this prediction a reference to the doings of the Maccabees; how, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Judas destroyed the altars and idols in Azotus (1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan again took that city, and burned it and the neighbouring towns, and, besieging Ashkelon, was received with great honour by the inhabitants, and confirmed in the possession of this place and Ekron (1 Macc. 10:84, etc.); and Simon stormed Gaza (? Gazara, a place near Ashdod), cleansed the houses of idols, "put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the Law" (1 Macc. 13:47, 48). But though such events partially fulfil the prophecy, the seer looks forward to a greater issue, and in these comparatively petty details beholds the working of the great principle that all nations shall be subdued to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even he, shall be for our God;</span> better, <span class="accented">he too shall be left</span> (or, <span class="accented">a remnant</span>) <span class="accented">for our God.</span> The Philistine shall become a choice and elect remnant unto the God of the Israelites, and no longer regarded as alien and impure. <span class="cmt_word">As a governor;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "head over a thousand." which the word <span class="accented">alluph</span>  means (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5, 6</a>). It is used of the chiefs of Edom in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15, 16</a>, etc., where the Authorized Version gives "dukes." The tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, consisting of families, each of which was held together by closer affinities than the mere tribal bond (see note on Micah 5:2). The meaning is that the Philistine shall be admitted into the commonwealth of Israel as one of her chiefs. <span class="cmt_word">Ekron as a Jebusite.</span> "Ekron" is equivalent to "the Ekronite," who again stands in the place of all the Philistines. The Jebusites were the ancient possessors of Zion, who held their position till the days of David, and, when at last conquered by him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>, etc.), were incorporated into his nation, and, as we may infer from Araunah's conduct, adopted his religion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-23.htm">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>). God promises here that the Philistines, like the Jebusites, shall be absorbed into the Jewish Church. Mr. Drake ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) curiously renders, "He shall be as Eleph (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) in Judah, and Ekron as Jebusi," explaining that the cities of Philistia were to be incorporated into Judaea. The conquests of Alexander conduced to the conversion of the heathen and their reception into the Church of God; and the general principle enunciated by all the prophets was tiros abundantly confirmed. But it is rot easy to discover the exact historical fulfilment of the latter part of this prophecy, concerning the merging of the Philistines in the Jewish nation. Josephus ('Ant.,' 13:15. 4) tells us that, about  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, the Jews held most of their cities, destroying some whose inhabitants refused to become proselytes. In the time of our Lord, by reason of intermarriage and social intercourse, the Philistines had ceased to be regarded as a separate nation; and a little later Philistia, far from being considered as alien and hostile, under the form Palestine, gave its name to the whole country. Christianity, too, made rapid progress in this district, so that the psalmist's words received herein a fulfilment, "Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Gush; this one was born there" (<a href="../../par/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>).

The phrase, "him that passeth by and him that returneth," is used of an enemy making incursions, or attacking at various points (see note on Zechariah 7:14). The Vulgate gives the whole clause thus: <span class="accented">Circumdabo domum meam ex his, qui militant mihi euntes et revertentes</span>, "I will defend my house with a guard chosen from those who serve me and do my will," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> angels. But this seems far from the signification of the Hebrew. Pusey restricts the meaning to the proceedings of Alexander, who passed by Judaea on his way to Egypt, and returned by the same route, without doing any injury to Jerusalem. Here comes in the Talmudic story related by Josephus ('Ant.,' 11:08). The Jews "repaid the protection of Persia with a devoted loyalty, which prompted them to refuse the demand of submission made by Alexander during the siege of Tyre. He marched to chastise them after the fall of Gaza, and the beautiful city had already risen before his view on the hill of Zion, when he found the high priest Jaddua waiting his approach at the watch station of Sapha, clad in his robes of gold and purple, and followed by a train of priests and citizens in pure white. The conqueror bowed in reverence to the Holy Name upon the high priest's frontlet; and, being asked by Parmenio the reason of his conduct, said that in a dream at Dium, he had seen the God of Jaddua, who encouraged him to pass over into Asia, and promised him success. Then entering Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice in the temple, heard the prophecy of Daniel about himself; and granted certain privileges to all the Jews throughout his empire. The desire to honour a shrine so celebrated as, the Jewish temple is quite in accordance with the conduct of Alexander at Ilium and Ephesus, Gordium and Tyre. The privileges he is said to have conferred upon the Jews were enjoyed under his successors, and some minor matters have been adduced in confirmation of the story. On the other hand, the classical writers are entirely silent on the subject, and the details of Josephus involve grave historical inconsistencies. It seems not an unreasonable conjecture that the story is an embellishment of some incident that occurred when the high priest came to Gaza to tender the submission of the Jews. But we must not dismiss it without a remark on the vast influence which the conquests of Alexander had in bringing the Jews into closer relations with the rest of Asia, and so preparing them to fulfil their ultimate destiny as Christians" (P. Smith, 'History of the World,' 1:60, etc). <span class="cmt_word">Oppressor</span>. The word is used for "taskmaster" in <a href="../../par/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>.

All attempts to disprove the Messianic import of this passage have been unavailing. Even critics who refer this part of Zechariah (ch. 9-11.) to an unknown author writing in the time of Hezekiah, allow that it is replete with Messianic ideas, and can be applied to no hero of Jewish story or event of Jewish history. There is no other "King" of Israel to whom it can refer. Our blessed Lord himself, by his abnormal actions on Palm Sunday, plainly assumed the part of the predicted King, and meant the people to recognize in him the promised Messiah (see the full discussion of the subject in Dr. Pusey's notes, pp. 556, etc.). <span class="accented">Thy King.</span> A king of thine own race, no stranger, but one predestined for thee.

Vulgate, <span class="accented">salvator</span>; so the Syriac and Chaldee. The genius of the language requires the participle to be taken passively, as it is in two other passages where it occurs (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16</a>). The context has seemed to some to demand that it be understood in an active sense, thus contrasting him who came to save with the haughty Grecian conqueror, whose progress was marked by bloodshed. But the usual meaning of the word affords a satisfactory sense. The King who comes is "saved," endowed with salvation, either as being protected and upheld by God (<a href="../../par/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1, 2, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-8.htm">Isaiah 49:8</a>), or as being victorious and so able to aid his people. In this latter view, the active sense is included in the passive. His own deliverance is a sure sign of the deliverance of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Lowly</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "meek;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">pauper</span> - meek and lowly, as Christ himself says (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>),far removed from warlike pomp and worldly greatness. The word is also rendered "afflicted," and would then be in accordance with the description in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13-53:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Riding upon an ass.</span> In illustration of his poor or afflicted estate; it is this, and not merely the peace. fulness of his reign, that is meant by this symbolical action, as we see by the following clause, where the youthfulness of the animal is the point enforced. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="accented">even, and that</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon a colt the foal of an ass;</span> such as she asses bear, and one not trained; as the evangelist says, "whereon never man sat."

In old times judges and men of distinction rode upon asses (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>); but from Solomon's days the horse had been used, not only in war, but on all state occasions (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>); and the number of horses brought back on the return from Babylon is specially mentioned (<a href="../../par/ezra/2-66.htm">Ezra 2:66</a>). So to predicate of a King that he would come to his capital riding, not on a war horse, but on a young, unbroken ass, showed at once that he himself was not to be considered a victorious general or a worldly potentate, and that his kingdom was not to be won or maintained by carnal arms. This is signified more fully in the following verse, which describes the character and extent of Messiah's kingdom. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-10.htm">Zechariah 9:10</a></div><div class="verse">And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion <i>shall be</i> from sea <i>even</i> to sea, and from the river <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will cut off the chariot.</span> All the apparatus of war will be removed, Messiah's rule being not established by physical force, or maintained by military defences.

From the use of these terms here it cannot be concluded that the author wrote at a time when the two kingdoms existed side by side. In the first place, the description of the whole people is given poetically, and must not be taken to have more significance than is intended; and secondly, in ch. 8:13, which is confessedly post-exilian, the "house of Judah," and the "house of Israel" are distinguished. Dr. Cheyne notes, too, that in Ezekiel (Ezekiel 37:15-28), who prophesied during the Captivity, the ten tribes are distinguished by the name of  Ephraim, and pertinently asks why such term may not be also used by one who wrote after the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">The battle bow stands for all weapons of war.</span> That Messiah's kingdom should be peaceful and peace-bringing, see the prophecies (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4-7</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/micah/5-10.htm">Micah 5:10, 11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He shall speak peace unto the heathen.</span> He will extend this peace to all the world, teaching the heathen to receive his spiritual rule, to compose their differences, to lay aside their arms, and live as one united family (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From sea even to sea.</span> Geographically, the phrase means from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>, from whence our passage is derived.

Both expressions obtain an unlimited significance, and show the universal extent of Messiah's kingdom; for in him, according to the promise made to Abraham, all the families of the earth should be blessed.

The absence of water may be notified either to imply that the tortures of thirst were added to the horror of the situation, or to intimate that the prisoners were not hopelessly drowned therein.

In the Maccabean struggle the bloodshed was often very considerable (see 1 Macc. 7:32, 46 1 Macc. 11:47; 2 Macc. 8:30 2Macc. 10:17, 23, 31, etc.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for <i>they shall be as</i> the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall save them.</span> He shall give them a positive blessing beyond mere deliverance from enemies. Keil, "Shall endow them with salvation." <span class="cmt_word">As the flock of his people;</span> so the Vulgate; literally, <span class="accented">as a flock, his people</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. He will tend his people as a shepherd tends his flock (<a href="../../par/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 8</a>, etc.), So Christ calls himself the "good Shepherd," and his followers "little flock" (<a href="../../par/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Stones of a crown</span>. The valuable gems set in crowns and diadems, or in the high priest's official dress. The people shall be in God's sight as precious as these in the eyes of men, and shall be highly exalted. The Septuagint and Vulgate render, "sacred stones;" and Knabenbauer thinks that by the term is meant the temple of God, which shall arise or shine in the Holy Laud, as a reward for its faithful defence. But the sense given above is satisfactory and simpler. <span class="cmt_word">Lifted up as an ensign upon his land;</span> better, as the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">glittering upon his land.</span> "His" may refer to Jehovah, or Israel; probably the latter is meant. The "land" is the crown or diadem in which the precious stones, the redeemed people, are set. They shall be raised to the highest possible glory and honour. If the words be taken in the sense of "raised on high over his land," they must be considered to indicate that the crown which contained the gems shall be raised aloft in victorious triumph. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/zechariah/9-17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">For how great <i>is</i> his goodness, and how great <i>is</i> his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His goodness.</span> The goodness, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the prosperity, of Israel or the land. Revised Version margin, "their prosperity." If the affix "his" is referred to Jehovah, the nouns "goodness" and "beauty" must be taken, not as his attributes, but as gifts bestowed by him, the prosperity and beauty which he confers. But it is more suitable to the context to consider the reference to be to the people, who in the next clause are divided into young men and maidens, and to take the "goodness," or goodliness, as appertaining more especially to the former, and the "beauty" to the latter. <span class="cmt_word">His beauty</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-14.htm">Ezekiel 16:14</a>). (For the Messianic interpretation, see <a href="../../par/psalms/45-2.htm">Psalm 45:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-17.htm">Isaiah 33:17</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Corn...new wine. This</span> is an expression often found to denote great abundance and prosperity. The two are distributed poetically between the youths and maidens (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-12.htm">Jeremiah 31:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-18.htm">Joel 2:18, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Make...cheerful;</span> literally, <span class="accented">make sprout.</span> It probably refers to the increase of population occurring in times  of plenty. This outward prosperity is a symbol of God's favour and the uprightness of the people. In these things, too, we may see adumbrated the spiritual blessings of the gospel, which are, as corn and wine, to strengthen and refresh the soul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../zechariah/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Zechariah 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Zechariah 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../zechariah/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Zechariah 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Zechariah 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
