The idea broached by some commentators, that this variation in expression marks some change in St. Paul's confidence in Timothy, seems utterly unfounded. The exhortations to boldness and courage which follow were the natural results of the danger in which St. Paul's own life was, and the depression of spirits caused by the desertion of many friends (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10-16</a>). St. Paul, too, knew that the time was close at hand when Timothy, still young, would no longer have him to lean upon and look up to, and therefore would prepare him for it; and possibly he may have seen some symptoms of weakness in Timothy's character, which made him anxious, as appears, indeed, in the course of this Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Grace</span>, etc. (so <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, A.V.; 2 John 3). Jude has "mercy, peace, and love." The salutation in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a> is "grace and peace," as also in <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>, and elsewhere in St. Paul's Epistles, and in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>.

For what does the apostle give thanks to God? The answer to this question will give the clue to the explanation. The only thing mentioned in the context which seer, s a proper subject of thanksgiving is that which is named in ver. 5, viz. the "unfeigned faith" that was in Timothy. That this was a proper subject of thanksgiving we learn from <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, where St. Paul writes that, having heard of their faith in the Lord Jesus, he ceased not to give thanks for then-J, making mention of them in his prayers (see, too, <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>). Assuming, then, that this was the subject of his thanksgiving, we notice especially the reading of the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "having received," and the note of Bengel that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means to be reminded of any one by another, as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is used when any one comes to your recollection without external prompting; both which fall in with our previous conclusion. And we get for the main sentence the satisfactory meaning: "I give thanks to God that I have received (or, because I have received) a most pleasant reminder (from some letter or visitor to which he does not further allude) of your unfeigned faith," etc, The main sentence clearly is: "I thank God... having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee." The intermediate words are, in Paul's manner, parenthetical and explanatory. Being about to say that it was at some special remembrance of Timothy's faith that he gave thanks, the thought arose in his mind that there was a continual remembrance of him day and night in his prayers; that he was ever thinking of him, longing to see him, and to have the tears shed at their parting turned into joy at their meeting again. And so he interposes this thought, and prefaces it with <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> - not  surely, "how," as in the R.V., but in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>, "as," "just as." And so the whole passage comes out: "Just <span class="accented">as</span> I have an unceasing remembrance of you in my prayers, day and night, longing to see you, that the tears which I remember you shed at our parting may be turned into joy, <span class="accented">so</span> do I give special thanks to God on the remembrance of your faith."

It is hardly a real word, and has no place in Stephens' 'Thes.,' except incidentally by comparison with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;</span>. It has, however, a classical usage. The proper word for a "grandmother" is <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Lois</span>; a name not found elsewhere, possibly meaning "good," or "excellent," from the same root as <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This and the following Eunice are examples of the frequent use of Greek or Latin names by Jews. Eunice, we know from <a href="../../par/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>, was a Jewess and a Christian, as it would seem her mother Lois was before her.

In both passages it is contrasted with a previous state of despondency (<a href="../../par/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>) or fear (1 Macc. 13:2). We must, therefore, conclude that St. Paul knew Timothy to be cast down and depressed by his own imprisonment and imminent danger, and therefore exhorted him to revive . 'the spirit of power, and of love, and of a sound mind," which was given him at his ordination. The metaphor is taken from kindling slumbering ashes into a flame by the bellows, and the force of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is to show that the embers had gone down from a previous state of candescence or frame - "to rekindle, light up again."

The laying on of hands was also the medium through which the Holy Ghost was given in Confirmation (<a href="../../par/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>), and in healing (<a href="../../par/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18, 23</a>).

It seems certain, therefore, that St. Paul thought that Timothy's gentle spirit was in danger of being cowed by the adversaries of the gospel. The whole tenor of his exhortation, combined as it was with words of warm affection, is in harmony with this thought. Compare with the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Of power and love.</span> Power (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) is emphatically the attribute of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../../par/luke/4-14.htm">Luke 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4</a>, etc.), and that which he specially imparts to the servants of Christ (<a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-8.htm">Acts 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>, etc.).

"Discipline" is not a very happy rendering, though it gives the meaning; "correction," or "sound instruction," is perhaps nearer. It would seem that Timothy had shown some signs of weakness, and had not boldly reproved and instructed in their duty certain offenders, as true love for souls required him to do. The phrase from Plutarch's 'Life of Cato,' quoted by Alford, exactly gives the force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "For the amendment and correction of the rest."

For a full description of the abolition of death and the introduction of eternal life in its stead, through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, see <a href="../../par/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>. and 6, and especially Romans 6:8-11. Through the gospel; because the gospel both declares the death and resurrection of Christ, and calls us to share in them. These mighty glories of the gospel were good reasons why Timothy should not be ashamed of the testimony of his Lord, nor shrink from the afflictions of the gospel. They were signal evidences of the power of God.

This he expresses in a metaphor drawn from the common action of one person entrusting another with some precious deposit, to be kept for a time and restored whole and uninjured. All the words in the sentence are part of this metaphor. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> must be taken in the sense of "entrusting" (<span class="accented">curae ac fidei alicujus committo</span>), as <a href="../../par/luke/16-11.htm">Luke 16:11</a>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "to be entrusted with the gospel" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am entrusted with a dispensation" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; see Wisd. 14:5, etc.). And so in classical Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "to entrust something to another" to take care of for you. Here, then, St. Paul says (not as in the R.V., "I know him whom I have believed," which is quite inadmissible, but), "I know whom I have trusted [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in whom I have placed confidence, and to whom I have committed the keeping of my deposit], and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) unto that day." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is the thing which Paul entrusted to his faithful guardian, one who he knew would never betray the trust, but would restore it to him safe and sound at the day of Christ. What the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was may be difficult to express in any one word, but it comprised himself, his life, his whole treasure, his salvation, his joy, his eternal happiness - all for the sake of which he risked life and limb in this world, content to lose sight of them for a while, knowing that he should receive them all from the hands of God in the day of Christ. All thus hangs perfectly together. There can be no reasonable doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> means, "my deposit" - that which I have deposited with him. Neither is there the slightest difficulty in the different applications of the same metaphor in ver. 14 and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>. For it is as true that God entrusts to his faithful servants the deposit of the faith, to be kept by them with jealous fidelity, as it is that his servants entrust to him the keeping of their souls, as knowing him to be faithful.

It may, however, well be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> here is used in even as strong a sense as in the other two passages, inasmuch as here it follows instead of preceding the substantive (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The pattern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a> (where see note), where it manifestly means a "pattern," not a "form."

This verb is used, as here, governing an accusative of the person or thing turned away from, in <a href="../../par/titus/1-14.htm">Titus 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-25.htm">Hebrews 12:25</a>, as frequently in classical Greek. The use of the aorist here is important, as St. Paul does not mean to say that the Churches of Asia had all forsaken him, which was not true, and which it would be absurd to inform Timothy of if it were true, living as he was at Ephesus, the central city of Asia, but adverts to some occasion, probably connected with his trim before Nero, when they shrank from him in a cowardly way. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x391;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> means "the whole party in Asia" connected with the  particular transaction to which St. Paul is alluding, and which was known to Timothy though it is not known to us. Perhaps he had applied to certain Asiatics, whether Christians or Jews or GraecoRomans, for a testimony to his orderly conduct in Asia, and they had refused it; or they may have been at Rome at the time, and avoided St. Paul; and among them Phygelus and Hermogenes, whose conduct may have been particularly ungrateful and unexpected. Nothing is known of either of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Grant</span> for <span class="accented">give</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Grant mercy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). This connection of the words is only found here. <span class="cmt_word">The house of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Onesiphorus</span>. It is inferred from this expression, coupled with that in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, that Onesiphorus himself was no longer living; and hence ver. 18 (where see note) is thought by some to be an argument for prayers for the dead. The inference, further strengthened by the peculiar language of ver. 18, though not absolutely certain, is undoubtedly probable. The connection between this and the preceding verse is the contrast between the conduct of Phygelus and Hermogenes and that of Onesiphorus. They repudiated all acquaintance with the apostle in his day of trial; he, when he was in Rome, diligently sought him and with difficulty found him. and oft refreshed him with Christian sympathy and communion, acting with no less courage than love. He was no longer on earth to receive a prophet's reward (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41</a>), but St. Paul prays that he may receive it in the day of Christ, and that meanwhile God may requite to his family the mercy he had showed to St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Refreshed me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">revived me</span>.

Otherwise it is better to take the words as a new sentence. The repetition of "the Lord" is remarkable, but nothing seems to hang upon it. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> seems to suppose the Lord sitting on the judgment throne. As regards the amount of encouragement given by this passage to prayers for the dead (supposing Onesiphorus to have been dead), the mere expression of a pious wish or hope that he may find mercy is a very slender foundation on which to build the superstructure of prayer and Masses for the deliverance of souls from purgatory. <span class="cmt_word">In how many things,</span> etc. St. Paul does not say, as the A.V. makes him say, that Onesiphorus "ministered unto him" at Ephesus. It may have been so, but the words do not necessarily mean this. "What good service he did at Ephesus" would faithfully represent the Greek words; and this might describe great exertions made by Onesiphorus after his return from Rome to procure the apostle's acquittal and release by the intercession of the principal persons at Ephesus. This would, of course, be known to Timothy. It may, however, describe the ministerial labours and services of Onesiphorus at Ephesus after his return from Rome, or it may refer to former ministrations when Paul and Timothy were at Ephesus together (see Introduction). There seem to be no materials for arriving at absolute certainty on the point. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_timothy/6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Timothy 6"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Timothy 6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_timothy/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Timothy 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm"><title>2 Timothy 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_timothy/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_timothy/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_timothy/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_timothy/1.htm" title="2 Timothy 1">&#9668;</a> 2 Timothy 2 <a href="../2_timothy/3.htm" title="2 Timothy 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Child</span> for <span class="accented">son</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">strengthened</span> for <span class="accented">strong</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be strengthened</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); more exactly (as Huther), <span class="accented">become strong</span>, or, which is the same thing, <span class="accented">strengthen thyself</span>; implying, perhaps, though gently expressed, some previous weakness, as m <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>, "From weakness were made strong;" where the image seems to be that of recovery from sickness.

The strength, Timothy is reminded, by which he was to fight the good fight, was not his own, but that which would come to him from the grace and love of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Which</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The things which thou hast heard,</span> etc. Here we have distinctly enunciated the succession of apostolical doctrine through apostolical men. We have also set before us the partnership of the presbyterate, and, in a secondary degree, of the whole Church, with the apostles and bishops their successors, in preserving pure and unadulterated the faith once delivered to the saints. There can be little doubt that St. Paul is here alluding to Timothy's ordination, as in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6, 7, 13, 14</a>. Timothy had then heard from the apostle's lips a certain "form of sound words" - something in the nature of a creed, some summary of gospel truth, which was the deposit placed in his charge; and in committing it to him, he and the presbyters present had laid their hands on him, and the whole Church had assented, and confirmed the same. "Thus through many witnesses," whose presence and assent, like that of witnesses to the execution of a deed of transfer of land (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10, 16, 18</a>), was necessary to make the transaction valid and complete, had Timothy received his commission to preach the Word of God; and what he had received he was to hand on in like manner to faithful men, who should be able to teach the same to others also. <span class="cmt_word">Commit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); identifying the doctrine committed to be handed on with the <span class="accented">deposit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-14.htm">2 Timothy 1:14</a>. It is important to note here both the concurrence of the presbyters and the assent of the Church. The Church has ever been averse to private ordinations, and has ever associated the people as consentient parties in ordination (Thirty-first Canon; Preface to "Form and Manner of Making of Deacons," and rubric at close - "in the face of the Church;" "Form and Manner of Ordering of Priests" - "Good people," etc.).

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament, usually governs the genitive case as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, it has an accusative, as here, and commonly in classical Greek. There seems to be hardly sufficient ground for the distinction mentioned by Bishop Ellicott, that with a genitive it means simply "remember," with the accusative "keep in remembrance." It is more difficult to determine the exact force and intent of the clause, "of the seed of David." It seems, however, to point to Christ's human nature, so as to make the example of Christ's resurrection apposite as an encouragement to Timothy. And this view is much strengthened by <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, where the addition, "according to the flesh," as contrasted with "the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness," marks the clause, "of the seed of David," as specially pointing to the human nature of Christ. The particular form which the reference takes probably arises from the form to which the apostle refers us as "my gospel." In that creed, which was the epitome of the gospel as preached by St. Paul, there was no doubt mention made of Christ's Davidic descent. Others, as Huther, think the clause points to the Messianic dignity of David. Others that it is inserted in refutation of the Docetae, and to show the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ; or that it is meant to mark especially the fulfilment of prophecy. But the first explanation is quite satisfactory, and the general purpose of the reference to our Lord as intended to encourage Timothy to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ, is fully borne out by the "faithful saying" in vers. 11 and 12, "If we died with him, we shall also live with him: if we endure, we shall also reign with him."

Hence sometimes the idea of <span class="accented">teaching</span> predominates, sometimes that of <span class="accented">correcting</span> or chastising. Here the context shows that the idea of <span class="accented">teaching</span> is pre-dominant - partly because the word suggests something contrary to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 23, and partly because the end of this <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is to bring them to the knowledge of God's truth.

In classical Greek, where it is, however, uncommon, it means literally "to recover from drunkenness," hence, "to come to one's self," "to come to a right mind" (see Steph., 'Thes.'). <span class="cmt_word">Snare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Having been taken captive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament in <a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a> besides this place, but common in the LXX. and in classical Greek, in the sense of "to take alive," of prisoners of war, who, if not ransomed, always became slaves of the conqueror. Here, therefore, the meaning is "having been captured and enslaved." <span class="cmt_word">By him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of course the devil, who had just been named as having ensnared them. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the will of him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The difficulty of the passage lies in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which at first sight seems to indicate a different antecedent from the antecedent of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. This grammatical difficulty has led to the strange rendering of the R.V., and to the wholly unjustifiable intrusion into the text of the words, "the Lord's servant" and of "God," producing altogether a sentence of unparalleled awkwardness and grotesqueness, and utter improbability. But there is no real difficulty in referring <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to the same person as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (meaning in both cases the devil), as in the passage from Plato's 'Cratylus,' cited by Huther, after De Wette, the cause of the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being that St. Paul was at the moment emphasizing the fact of these captives being deprived of their own will, and made subservient to the will of another. The passage may be paraphrased: "If peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, so as to recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, after they had been led captive by him, so as to be no longer their own masters, but obliged to do his will."  The implied contrast is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, just as in the passage from the 'Cratylus,' p. 430 (vol. 4. p. 306, Bekker's edit.), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>.

For the general turn of phrase, comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, "Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ," where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) corresponds to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It should be noted further that the sentence is certainly rather a peculiar one, from the use of such uncommon words as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, and the mixture of metaphors. But the sense of the A.V. is fully borne out. The interpretation preferred by Bishop Ellicott is "they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil unto his will (viz.

In favour of its referring to God is the expression in the Prophet Isaiah commented upon by our Lord in <a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> answers to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the promise concerning the Comforter, "He shall teach you all things" (<a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>, etc.); and the very similar reasoning of St. John, when he is exhorting his "little children" to stand fast in the faith, in spite of those that seduced them: "Let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning;" for "the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things,...and even as it hath taught yon, abide in him" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24-28</a>); and other similar passages. There would obviously be great force in reminding Timothy that he had received the gospel under the immediate teaching of the Holy Spirit, and that it would be a shameful thing for him to turn aside under the influence of those impostors. If <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> does not refer to God, it must refer to St. Paul. If, on the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is the true reading (which is less probable), it must refer to Lois and Eunice, which seems rather feeble.

But as <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> is invariably used in the New Testament for "Scripture," and not for any profane writing: it is not in accordance with biblical language to say, "every inspired Scripture," because every <span class="accented">Scripture</span> is inspired. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sentence, taken according to (B), is an extremely awkward, and, as Alford admits. harsh construction, net supported in its entirety by one single parallel usage in the whole New Testament. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The sentence, taken according to (A), is a perfectly simple one, and is exactly parallel with <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is in perfect harmony with the context.

They are inspired of God, and hence their wide use and great power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> This interpretation is supported by high authority: Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, etc., among the ancients (Alford); and Bengel, Wiesinger, De Wette, etc., among modern. The advocates of (B), as Bishop Ellicott, Dean Alford, etc., speak very doubtfully. With regard to the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, no doubt, strict grammar, in the absence of the article, favours the rendering in the R.V., "every Scripture," rather than that of the A.V., "all Scripture." But Alford's remark on <a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a> applies with full force here: "When a word or an expression came to bear a technical conventional meaning, it was also common to use it without the article, as if it were a proper name, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>," etc. Therefore, just as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>) means "all Jerusalem," not "every Jerusalem," so here <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> means "all  Scripture." What follows of the various uses of Holy Scripture is not true of "every Scripture." One Scripture is profitable for doctrine, another for reproof, and so on. Examples of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span> without the article are <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/1-2.htm">Romans 1:2</a>; and of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> not followed by the article, and yet meaning "all," are in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a> and Ephesians 3:15. <span class="cmt_word">Inspired of God,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament or LXX., but occasionally in classical Greek, as Plutarch. <span class="cmt_word">For teaching</span>, etc. The particular uses for which Scripture is said to be profitable present no difficulty. Teaching, of which Holy Scripture is the only infallible source. <span class="cmt_word">Reproof</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>; but in classical Greek it means "a proof," specially for the purpose of "refutation" of a false statement or argument. Here in the same sense for the "conviction" or "refutation" of false teachers (comp. <a href="../../par/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9, 13</a>), but probably including errors in living (compare in the 'Ordering of Priests,' "That there be no place left among you, either for error in religion or for viciousness in life"). <span class="cmt_word">Correction</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but occasionally in the LXX., and frequently in classical Greek, as Aristotle, Plato, etc., in the sense of "correction," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. setting a person or thing straight, "revisal," "improvement," "amendment," or the like.

By the use of Holy Scripture the Christian is being continually more perfectly instructed in holy living.

the other that in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> it undoubtedly refers to Timothy in his character of chief pastor of the Church, and that here too the whole force of the description of the uses and excellence of Holy Scripture is brought to bear upon the exhortations in ver. 14, "Continue <span class="accented">thou</span> in the things which thou hast heard," addressed to Timothy as the Bishop of the Ephesian Church (see, too, ch. 4:1-5, where it is abundantly clear that all that precedes was intended to bear directly upon Timothy's faithful and vigorous discharge of his office as an evangelist). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_timothy/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Timothy 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_timothy/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Timothy 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

Others take them as the accusatives of the things sworn by, "I charge thee before God and Jesus Christ, and by his epiphany and kingdom," as <a href="../../par/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "by God;" <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "by Jesus;" <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "by the Lord." But how awkward such a separation of the thing sworn by from the verb <span class="accented">is</span>, and how unnatural it is to couple with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> the two ideas, "before God" and "by Christ's epiphany," and how absolutely without example such a swearing by Christ's epiphany and kingdom is, nobody needs to be told. Others, as Huther, try to get over part at least of this awkwardness by taking the two <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>s as "both:" "by both his epiphany and his kingdom." Ellicott explains it by saying that as you could not put "the epiphany and the kingdom" in dependence upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as if they were persons like <span class="accented">God</span> and <span class="accented">Christ</span>), they "naturally pass into the accusative."

The phrase is metaphorical, but it is uncertain whether the metaphor is that of a ship borne along by full sails, or of full measure given. If the former is the metaphor, then the derived meaning, when applied to persons, is that of full persuasion, entire and implicit faith, which carries men forward in a bold and unwavering course; or, when applied to things, that of being undoubtedly believed. But if the metaphor is taken from "bringing full measure;" then the sense in the passive voice when applied to persons will be "to be fully satisfied," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to have full assurance, and, when applied to things, "to be fully believed" (Liddell and Scott).

The classical use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> rather favours the sense, either of" release" or of " dissolution."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="accented">Forsook</span> for <span class="accented">hath forsaken</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">went</span> for <span class="accented">is departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. (twice). <span class="cmt_word">Demas</span>. Nothing more is known of Demas than what is gathered from the mention of him in <a href="../../par/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a> and <a href="../../par/philemon/1-1.htm">Philemon 1:1:24</a>. We learn from those passages that he was a fellow labourer of the apostle, and it is remarkable that in them both he is coupled, as here, with Luke and Mark (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>). (See Introduction.) <span class="cmt_word">Having loved this present world.</span> It would appear from this that Demas had not the faith or the courage to run the risk of sharing St. Paul's imminent martyrdom at Rome, but left him, while he was free to do so, under pretence of an urgent call to Thessaloniea; just as Mark left Paul and Barnabas (<a href="../../par/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>). But there is no ground to believe that he was an apostate from the faith. The coupling together of Demas and Aristarchus in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> suggests that Demas may have been a Thessalonian, as we know that Aristarchus was (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). <span class="accented">Demas</span> is thought to be a shortened form of <span class="accented">Demarchus.</span> If so, we have a slight additional indication of his being a Thessalonian, as compounds with <span class="accented">archos</span> or <span class="accented">arches</span> would seem to have been common in Thessalonica (compare <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Crescens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>); only mentioned here. It is a Latin name, like <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Pudens</span>, in ver. 21. There was a cynic philosopher of this name in the second century, a great enemy of the Christians. The tradition ('Apost. Constit.,' 7:46) that he preached the gospel in Galatia is probably derived from this passage. Titus, etc. The last mention of Titus, not reckoning the Epistle to Titus, is that in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>, from which it appears that St. Paul had sent him to Corinth just before his own last visit to that city. How the interval was filled up, and where Titus passed the time, we know not. He is not once named in the Acts of the Apostles, nor in any of St. Paul's Epistles written during his first imprisonment. But we gather from <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a> that he accompanied St. Paul to Crete, presumably after the apostle's return from Spain; that he was left there for a time to organize the Church; that later he joined the apostle at Nicopolis (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>),and, doubtless by St. Paul's desire, went to Dalmatia, as mentioned in this tenth verse. And here our knowledge of him ends. Tradition pretty consistently makes him Bishop of Gortyna, in Crete, where are the ruins of a very ancient church dedicated to St. Titus, in which service is occasionally performed by priests from the neighbourhood (Dean Howson, in 'Dict. of Bible:' art. "Titus").

How he spent his time between that date and the mention of him here as still with St. Paul, we have no knowledge. But it looks as if he may have been in close personal attendance upon him all the time. if he had been permitted to write a supplement to the Acts, perhaps the repeated "we" would have shown this. <span class="cmt_word">Take Mark.</span> Mark had apparently been recently reconciled to St. Paul when he wrote <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and was with him when he wrote <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>. We know nothing more of him till we learn from this passage that he was with or near to Timothy, and likely to accompany him to Rome in his last visit to St. Paul. He is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>, as being with St. Peter at Babylon. The expression, "take" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), seems to imply that Timothy was to pick him up on the way, as the word is used in <a href="../../par/acts/20-13.htm">Acts 20:13, 14</a>; and, though less certainly, in <a href="../../par/acts/23-31.htm">Acts 23:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He is useful to me,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as ch. 2:21 (where see note). This testimony to Mark's ministerial usefulness, at a time when his faithfulness and courage would be put to a severe test, is very satisfactory. <span class="cmt_word">For ministering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It may be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here means "the ministry," as in the A.V. and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, or, as in the R.V., more generally "for ministering," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for acting as an assistant to me in my apostolic labours. The words, "to me," favour the latter rendering. The sense would then be the same as that of the verb in <a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>, where we read that Timothy and Erastus "ministered unto him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to St. Paul, and that of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Mark in <a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>.

The presence of Luke, Timothy, Tychicus, Mark, with Paul now, as then, is remarkable (see ver. 10, note). <span class="cmt_word">I sent to Ephesus.</span> Theodoret (quoted by Alford, 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy,' ch. 9. sect. 1) says, "It is plain from this that St. Timothy was not at this time living at Ephesus, but somewhere else." And that certainly is the natural inference at first sight. But Bishop Ellicott suggests the possibility of Tychicus being the bearer of the First Epistle to Timothy, written not very long before, and this being merely an allusion to that well known fact. Another and more probable idea is that he was the bearer of this Epistle, that the object of his mission, like that of Artemas (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>), was to take Timothy's place at Ephesus during Timothy's absence at Rome, and that he is thus mentioned in the Epistle in order to commend him to the reverent regard of the Ephesian Church (Wordsworth). It is argued against this that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> would have been the more natural expression after the analogy of <a href="../../par/colossians/4-7.htm">Colossians 4:7</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>. But this objection would be removed if we suppose that the Epistle was sent by another hand, and that it was very possible that Timothy might have started for Rome before Tychicus could arrive at Ephesus. He might have orders to visit Corinth or Macedonia on his way. (For the arguments for and against Timothy being at Ephesus at this time, see Alford's 'Proleg.,' as above.)

This, again, is a Latin word. It occurs only here in the New Testament. They would probably be for the apostle to write his Epistles on. Or they may have been valuable manuscripts of some kind. In ver. 20 we learn that St. Paul had lately been at Miletus; and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a> that he was then going to Macedonia. Tress would be on his way to Macedonia, Greece, and Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8, 9, 11</a>), as it was on the return journey from Macedonia to Miletus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 15</a>). It should further be observed that the journey here indicated is the same as that referred to in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, which confirms the inevitable inference from this chapter that St. Paul, on his way to Rome from Miletus, whither he had come from Crete (<a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), passed through Tress, Macedonia, and Corinth (ver. 20), leaving Timothy at Ephesus.

In classical Greek the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the middle voice, "to display," can only be followed by a subjective quality, as "good will," "virtue," "long suffering," an "opinion," and the like (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). And so it is used in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>. The question naturally arises - When and where did Alexander thus injure St. Paul? - at Ephesus or at Rome? Bengel suggests Rome, and with great probability. Perhaps he did him evil by stirring up the Jews at Rome against the apostle at the time of "his first defence;" or by giving adverse testimony before the Roman tribunal, possibly accusing him of being seditious, and bringing up the riot at Ephesus as a proof of it; or in some other way, of which the memory has perished. <span class="cmt_word">Will render.</span> The R.T. has the future, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> for the optative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "a late and incorrect form for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;</span> (Ellicott, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

The Jews were always on the move. <span class="cmt_word">He greatly withstood our words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). For an exactly similar use, see <a href="../../par/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>, where Elymas "withstood" Paul and Barnabas; and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, where Jannes and Jambres "withstood" Moses. In this case we may be sure that Paul, in pleading for his life, did not omit to preach the gospel to his Gentile audience. Alexander tried to refute his words, not without effect. The apostle says "<span class="accented">our</span> words" (not "<span class="accented">my</span> words"), perhaps to associate with himself those other Christians who were with him. It certainly cannot mean "yours and mine," as Timothy was not with him when the "words" were spoken.

In classical Greek both forms are common in the sense of "coming to aid," "standing by any one," "assisting." Here it represents the Latin <span class="accented">assistere or adesse</span> in its technical sense of "standing by" an accused person as friend or assistant, to aid and abet them in their defence. Powerful men sometimes brought such a multitude of assistants as to overawe the magistrate, as Orgetorix the Helvetian, when summoned to trial, appeared  with ten thousand followers, and so there was no trial. Paul, like his Lord and Master, of whom it is written, "All his disciples forsook him and fled," had no one to stand with him in his hour of need.

The brave, unselfish spirit of the apostle thinking more of the proclamation of the gospel than of his own life, is truly admirable. <span class="cmt_word">I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</span> Surely there can be no doubt that, as Bengel says, this is a quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20, 21</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was delivered," comes from the twentieth verse, "Deliver my soul from the sword," and the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is found <span class="accented">verbatim</span> in ver. 21. The apostle means his deliverance from the executioner's sword. In the next verse we find both the words <span class="greek">&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the whole tone of the psalm breathes the same spirit as the saying, "The Lord stood by me." Dean Alford's suggestion that the lion here is Satan, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, and the danger which the apostle escaped was not death, which he did not fear, but betraying the gospel under the fear of death, is ingenious, but rather far fetched, though not impossible. It may possibly have been part of what was in St. Paul's mind.

Interpreted by the Lord's Prayer, and by its own internal evidence, the meaning clearly is, "The Lord, who stood by me at my trial, will continue to be my Saviour. He will deliver me from every evil design of mine enemies, and from all the wiles and assaults of the devil, in short, from the whole power of evil, and will bring me safe into his own kingdom of light and righteousness." There is a strong contrast, as Bengel pithily observes, between "the evil work" and "his heavenly kingdom." A triumphant martyrdom is as true a deliverance as escape from death. Compare our Lord's promise, "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (<a href="../../par/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> compared with ver. 16). St. Paul's confidence simply is that the Lord would, in his own good time and way, transfer him from this present evil world, and from the powers of darkness, into his eternal kingdom of light and righteousness.

Eusebius ('Ecc. Hist.,' 3:2) says, "Linus was ordained the first Bishop of Rome (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) after the martyrdom of Paul and Peter" (see, too, &sect; 4 of the same book). Some identify him with a certain Llin in Welsh hagiography, said to be the son of Caractacus. As regards <span class="accented">Pudens</span> and <span class="accented">Claudia</span>, nothing is known about them unless the very ingenious and interesting theory of Archdeacon Williams is true, which is necessarily very uncertain. According to this theory, Claudia is the <span class="accented">foreign</span> lady, a <span class="accented">Briton</span>, whose marriage with Pudens is spoken of by Martial in two epigrams, and who also bore the cognomen of <span class="accented">Rufina.</span> It is supposed that she was the daughter of the British king Cogidubnus, the ally of the Romans and of the Roman governor, Aulus Plautius, whose wife Pomponia is said by Tacitus to have been impeached of the crime of embracing a "foreign superstition," which was probably Christianity. Cogidubnus appears by an ancient inscription now at Goodwood to have taken the name of the Emperor Claudius, being called Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, which would naturally lead to his daughter being called Claudia. And if further she was adopted by the wife of her father's ally, the name Rufina would be accounted for, as a distinguished branch of the gens Pomponia bore the name of Rufus. And Martial's epigram is addressed to "Rufus," as one interested in the marriage. Claudia may either have learnt Christianity from Pomponia, or may have conveyed the knowledge of the gospel to her. On the other hand, the name of <span class="accented">Pudens</span> appears on the Goodwood inscription as having given, while still a heathen, a site for a temple of Neptune and Minerva, which was built "pro salute" of the imperial family under the authority of King Cogidubnus - curiously connecting him with the British king. It is probable that Pudens and Claudia were not yet married. Thus it will be seen that, while this theory is borne out by many coincidences, it cannot by any means be adopted as certain (see Dean Alford's <span class="accented">excussus</span> in the 'Proleg. to 2 Timothy;' and Conybeare and Howson's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. it. p. 501). Lewin ('Life and Epist. of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 392) warmly espouses the theory, but hesitates between Caractacus and Cogidubnus as the father of Claudia. Farrar rejects the whole theory "as an elaborate rope of sand" ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 2, p. 569). If Linus was the son, and Claudia the daughter, of Caractacus, they would be brother and sister.

All honour be to his blessed memory! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_timothy/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Timothy 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Timothy 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../titus/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Titus 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Titus 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
