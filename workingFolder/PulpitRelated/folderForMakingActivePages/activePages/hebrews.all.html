It is entitled "a psalm of David," nor is there anything in the psalm itself incompatible with his authorship. The question of authorship is, however, unimportant; all that is required for the purpose of the quotation being that it should have been the utterance of an inspired psalmist. The primary import of the passage quoted is that the psalmist, after deliverance from great affliction, for which he gives thanks, expresses his desire to act on the lesson learnt in his trouble by giving himself entirely to God's service. And the service in which God delights he declares to be, not sacrifices of slain beasts, but the doing of his will, the ears being opened to his Word, and his Law being within the heart. Now, bearing in mind what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the principle on which words used in the Old Testament with a primary human reference are applied in the New Testament directly to Christ, we shall have no difficulty in understanding such application here. The psalmist, it may be allowed, spoke in his own person, and as expressing his own feelings and desires; but, writing under inspiration, he aspired to an ideal beyond his own attainment, the true ideal for humanity, to be realized only in Christ. The ideal is such perfect self-oblation of the human will to God's as to supersede and render needless the existing sacrifices, which are acknowledged to be, in their own nature, valueless. That the psalmist did not really contemplate the fulfillment of this ideal in himself is evident from the penitential confessions of the latter verses of the psalm. It is but the yearning of inspired humanity for what was really needed for reconciliation with God, such yearning being in itself a prophecy. Hence what was thus spoken in the Spirit is adduced as expressing the mind and work of him who fulfilled all those prophetic yearnings, and effected, as Man and for man, what the holy men of old longed to do but could not. The expression, "when he cometh into the world," reminds us of <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, here used, is connected in thought with the <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> ("I am come") in the quotation. Idle are the inquiries of some commentators as to the precise time, either before or after the Incarnation, at which our Lord is to be conceived as so speaking. Enough to say that his purpose in coming into the world is in these significant words expressed. It is noteworthy, in regard to the attribution of this utterance to him, how frequently he is recorded to have spoken of having <span class="accented">come</span> into the world for the accomplishment of a purpose "genie, vel potius, <span class="accented">vent</span>, symbolum quasi Domini <span class="accented">Jesu</span> fuit" (Bengel). (See <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-34.htm">Matthew 10:34, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-11.htm">Matthew 18:11</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-38.htm">Mark 1:38</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>; and especially for close agreement with the language of the passage before us, <a href="../../par/john/6-38.htm">John 6:38</a>, "I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <span class="accented">will</span>, but the <span class="accented">will</span> of him that tent me;" and <a href="../../par/john/12-46.htm">John 12:46</a>, "I <span class="accented">am come</span> a light <span class="accented">into the world."</span>) The psalm is quoted from the LXX., with slight variation, not worth considering, as it does not affect the sense of the passage. But the variation of the LXX. from the Hebrew text requires notice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Instead of "a body didst thou prepare for me (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)" of the LXX. and the quotation from it, the Hebrew has "mine ears hast thou opened;" literally, "ears hast thou dug for me," meaning probably, "formed the cavity of my ears through which thy Word may penetrate," equivalent to "given me ears to hear," with reference, of course, to spiritual auscultation. If to the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> be assigned here the sense of <span class="accented">piercing</span>, rather than <span class="accented">hollowing out</span>, implying an entrance affected through the ears already formed, the general sense remains the same. In either case the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> may be accounted for, as being a free rendering, intended to give the meaning of the figure. But the substitution of "body" for "ears" is not so easily accounted for. One conjecture is that some transcriber of the Alexandrian translation of the Hebrew had inadvertently joined the last letter of the preceding word, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, to the following word, <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, and that the <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x399;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3a9;&#x3a4;&#x399;&#x391;</span> was then changed into the <span class="greek">&#x39c;</span> of <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a9;&#x39c;&#x391;</span>, so as to make sense of the word thus formed. But this is only conjecture. That some copies of the LXX. had <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> appears from the fact that the Vulgate, translated from the LXX., reads <span class="accented">aures perfecisti mihi</span>, and that some manuscripts of the LXX. still have <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1fb3;</span>. Thus there can be little doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was a wrong rendering of the Hebrew, however originating, which the writer of the Epistle found in the copies of the LXX. which he used. For that he himself altered the word to suit his purpose, and that the alteration got into copies of the LXX. from the Epistle, is highly improbable, considering the general accuracy of his quotations, and his purpose of proving his positions from the sacred documents to which his readers could refer. As to the unimportance of any such variations from the original Hebrew in the quotations of the Epistle from the LXX., as long as the argument is not affected, see what is said under Hebrews 1:7 with respect to the quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>. In this case the variation certainly does not affect the argument. For though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is certainly taken up again in ver. 10 as applicable to Christ, yet the argument of the passage by no means rests on this word, but on <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. This is indeed a passage (as was observed under Hebrews 9:14) notable for the very fact that the essence of the atonement is in it represented as consisting, not so much in its physical accompaniments as in its being a spiritual act of perfect self-oblation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The more probable meaning of the phrase translated in the LXX. and the quotation, "it is written <span class="accented">of</span> me <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)" is in the Hebrew," it is prescribed <span class="accented">unto</span> me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "laid on me as a duty;" this being also the sense in which the same words occur in <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>, "Great is the wrath of the Lord... because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is <span class="accented">prescribed to us</span>;" where the LXX. translates, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. The most obvious reference of the Hebrew psalm is to the Book of the Law generally, in which the duty of fulfilling the Divine will is enjoined, rather than to any <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, applied by the writer to himself individually. If so, it is not necessary to inquire what prophecy about himself David might have had in view; whether e.g. <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; or <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span> But the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, does certainly rather suggest a <span class="accented">prophecy</span>, and such suggestion is peculiarly appropriate in the application to Christ. Well, then, if here again there is some variation from the original Hebrew text, it is still such as to leave the general argument intact.

For the writer's purpose in referring once more to Jeremiah's prediction of the" new covenant" is to show from it the completeness and finality of Christ's atonement; and this, he argues, follows from this characteristic of the "new covenant" being added to the previous description of it - "Their sins and iniquities will I remember no more." CH. 10:19-END. HORTATORY PORTION OF THE EPISTLE. The great doctrine of Christ's eternal priesthood having been led up to, established by argument, and at length fully expounded, it remains only to press the practical result of a belief in it in alternate tones of encouragement and of warning. We have seen that, even in the earlier chapters, hortatory passages were frequently interposed, showing the purpose all along in the writer's mind. In the central and deepest part of the argument (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1-10:19</a>) there were none, close and uninterrupted attention to the course of thought being then demanded. But now, the argument being completed, the previous exhortations are taken up again, and enforced in consequently fuller and deeper tones. The connection of thought between these final admonitions and those previously interposed is evident when we compare the very expressions in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-23</a> with those in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>, and the warnings of <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., with those of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc. Thus appears, as in other ways also, the carefully arranged plan of the Epistle, different in this respect from the undoubted Epistles of St. Paul, in which the thoughts generally follow each other without great regard to artistic arrangement. This, however, is in itself by no means conclusive against St. Paul's authorship, since there would be likely to be just this difference between a set treatise composed for a purpose, and a letter written <span class="accented">currente calamo</span> by the same author. It does, however, mark a different class of composition, and is suggestive, as far as it goes, of a different writer.

The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("new") applied to the "way" dedicated for us by Christ, though meaning originally, according to its etymology, "newly slain," is commonly used to express "recent" only. And so here. It is a new way in relation to the old one of the high priest through the veil - a way untrodden by man till opened and dedicated by "the <span class="accented">great</span> Priest." The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> ("living") applied to the way distinguishes it, as a spiritual mode of approach, from the old one. "Opponitur <span class="accented">exanimo.</span> Per prosopopoeiam <span class="accented">vita</span> adscribitur <span class="accented">viae</span>, ex ipsa <span class="accented">vita</span> Christi, qui est <span class="accented">Via"</span> (Bengel; see <a href="../../par/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). But what is the meaning of the <span class="accented">veil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the word always used of the veil in the tabernacle or temple) being said to be "his flesh "? The idea cannot be simply that he passed through the human nature assumed at his incarnation to the heavenly throne; for the intended counterpart to the high priest's passing through the veil must have been after the completed sacrifice. It is rather that, at the moment of death, when, after saying, "It is finished," he "gave up the ghost," the human flesh (which had through all the ages been as a veil hiding "<span class="accented">the</span> unseen" from man, and behind which Christ himself had "<span class="accented">tabernacled"</span> during his human life) was, as it were, rent asunder and the new way opened. And that this was so was signified by the rending in twain of the veil of the temple from the top to the bottom, mentioned by St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-51.htm">Matthew 26:51</a>), at the very moment of the death upon the cross. This incident may have suggested to the writer the expression used. "<span class="accented">Quum</span> primum Christus per momentum mortis transierat, praesto fuit mera <span class="accented">virtus</span> et <span class="accented">vita.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <span class="accented">carnem suam</span>, quae item scissa est, ut velum" (Bengel). "The house of God" in ver. 21 is a resumption of the thought of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>, where Christ was shown to be greater than Moses, as being the SON <span class="accented">over</span> the house of God, having (be it observed) been called <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 1.

We may now draw near to the very heavenly mercy-seat, without any sense of a bar to our doing so on the ground of consciousness of sin. In Christ we are to see accomplished all that is needed for atonement. But there are conditions also required in ourselves, expressed first by the "true heart," and the "fullness of faith," and then by the clauses that fellow. These clauses, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> have a liturgical basis - that of the blood-sprinkling (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> of the people with the blood of the covenant under Mount Sinai, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>, and of the priests on their consecration, <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-23.htm">Leviticus 8:23</a>) and of the ablutions before sacrificial service (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-4.htm">Leviticus 16:4, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30.htm">Exodus 30</a>:39). Hence these two participial clauses are not to be separated from each other, and seem best to be both taken in connection with the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>. "Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience" means our having the inward consciousness of debarring sin removed through the blood of Christ; the "full assurance of faith" in the completed atonement, and the "true heart," being presupposed. The conjoined clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, etc., is capable also of being figuratively interpreted, in the sense that "our sinful bodies" have been "made clean," so as to be offered through life acceptably as "a living sacrifice," as well as "our souls washed through his most precious blood." And this may be taken as implied. But the terms <span class="accented">body</span> and <span class="accented">water</span> after <span class="accented">hearts</span> and <span class="accented">blood</span> certainly suggest a direct reference to baptism. And such definite allusion is in keeping with references elsewhere to the beginning of the Christian life (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-16.htm">Acts 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-21.htm">1 Peter 3:21</a>).

The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1</a>, where it denotes the gathering together at the <span class="accented">Parousia.</span> In 2 Macc. 2:7, where alone it occurs in the LXX., it expresses the actual assembling of people together, as does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>, both in the LXX. and the New Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/13-27.htm">Mark 13:27</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1-33.htm">Mark 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>). Hence, and in regard to the context as well as the etymology of the word, we may reject the less definite meaning, by some here assigned to it, of <span class="accented">Christian communion</span> (<span class="accented">conjugatio fidelium</span>), and the explanation of Bengel: "Sensus est, non modo debetis synagogam frequentare, ut Judaei, quod libentius facitis, sed etiam episynagogam, ut Christiani. Neque tamen innuitur praecise aggregatio ad unum locum, aut aggregatio ad unam <span class="accented">fidem</span>; sed, medio sensu, congregatio mutua <span class="accented">per amorem</span> et communicatio publica et privata officiorum Christianorum." The seen approach of the second advent (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>) is adduced as an additional argument against remissness. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> seems to imply more than the general belief in its imminence, founded on the language of Christ. It would seem as if the signs of the times were interpreted as denoting its approach (el. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>). And it may be that they were rightly so interpreted in reference to the primary fulfillment of our Savior's words, though to that only, as the event proved. The blending together in the discourses of <a href="../../par/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, <a href="../../par/mark/13.htm">Mark 13</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/17.htm">Luke 17</a>. and 21, of the times of the fall of Jerusalem and of the final day, would naturally lead Christians to regard the signs of the first event as denoting the other also. And indeed the imminence of the first, of which the signs were really apparent, was in itself a peculiar reason why the Hebrew Christians should stick resolutely to Christianity, for its own sake and apart from Judaism. Else might their whole hold on Christ be loosened in the temple's fall Thus, though the writer might share in the mistaken view then prevalent of the imminence of the final day, his warning, founded on the supposed signs of it, hits well the peculiar needs of his readers.

But it is first to be observed that the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is not aorist, but present, expressing a persistent habit; also that the whole context is sufficient to denote the kind of sin intended. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the preceding verses have pointed to laxity of allegiance to Christ, which might have further consequences; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the illustration of what is meant, adduced in ver. 28 from the Mosaic Law, is (as will appear under that verse) a case of entire apostasy - a sin not to be atoned for by any sacrifice, but visited by "cutting off;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the description in ver. 29 of the sin intended implies total repudiation of Christ. Observe, on <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, the contrast to <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a>, <span class="accented">al.</span>), expressive of sins of ignorance or infirmity. Not such sins, but deliberate sin with a high hand, is here intended; and further, for the reasons above given, one of this nature so heinous as to be beyond the reach of sacrifice. From all such considerations it appears that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here expresses the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-6.htm">Hebrews 6:6</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>), viz. final obdurate defection from the faith. Further, the previous conditions for the possibility of arriving at such a hopeless state, set forth more at length in vers. 4, 5 of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, are here shortly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which is to be interpreted in the light of the other passage (see note thereon). The consequences of such falling away are differently stated in the two passages. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, it was the impossibility of renewal unto repentance; here it is the absence of any further atoning sacrifice; and this in keeping with what has been now proved of the sacrifice of Christ having superseded all others and been "once for all." The drift is that, if this is deliberately rejected after full knowledge of it, no ether is left to have recourse to. Then the immediate mention of "judgment" is in keeping also with the conclusion of <a href="../../par/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9</a>. (see note on Hebrews 9:27), and is immediately suggested here by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 25.

But the case contemplated here is that of its being "too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of justice." Fearful (the writer would say) is the thought of being exposed, without possibility of escape or of atonement, to the wrath of the Eternal Righteousness. The inspired author of this Epistle had evidently an awful sense of the Divine wrath against sin, and of man's liability to it without atonement. He felt deeply the contradiction between humanity as it is and its ideal of perfection; and hence the wrath attributed to God in Holy Writ would appear to him as inseparable from a just conception of Divine holiness. For the more ardent the love in the human heart of moral good, by so much the keener is the indignation against moral evil, and the sense of the righteousness of retribution. The existence of such evil at all in the good God's universe is indeed a mystery; but, as long as it is there, we cannot but conceive the face of the holy God as set utterly against it; and so any revelation to us of the Divine nature would be imperfect did it not include the idea which is humanly expressed by such terms as "zeal," "jealousy," "wrath," "vengeance." Hence came the long-felt need of some atonement, to reconcile sinful man to the eternal holiness. This need was expressed of old by the institution of sacrifice, which, however - as is so clearly perceived in this Epistle - could never itself be really efficacious in the spiritual sphere of things. In the atonement of Christ (if rightly apprehended) is found at last a true satisfaction of this spiritual need. But, man's concurrence being still required, the idea of Divine wrath remains notwithstanding, as operative against such as, in deliberate perversity of free-will, after full knowledge, refuse to be thus reconciled. Hence the awful anticipations of future judgment on some, contained in this Epistle. The nature and duration of the doom to come, on such as remain subject to it, are in these passages left in obscurity. They speak only of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, an undefined expectation of something terrible. It may be observed, however, that, whatever be the force of other Scriptures in which the <span class="accented">fire</span> of that day is described as <span class="accented">eternal</span> and <span class="accented">unquenchable</span>, here at least the figure of a zeal of fire to <span class="accented">devour</span> the adversaries seems in itself to suggest rather utter destruction than perpetual pain.

Here certainly the context seems naturally to suggest a definite reference to baptism, as marking the date of the commencement of exposure to persecution. But if so, not, of course, so as to exclude the idea of inward spiritual enlightenment. "Hie primus erat ingressus ad Christianismum; baptismus apud idoneos salutare medium.

More than one such persecution might be in the writer's view, including, perhaps, that after the stoning of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); that instituted by Herod Agrippa, under which James the elder suffered (<a href="../../par/acts/12.htm">Acts 12</a>.); that which led to the martyrdom of James the Just (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:09. 1) and others.

The meaning is that by endurance in doing the will they would receive. The full and final enjoyment of what is promised is still future and conditioned by perseverance.

But the just shall live by faith: and if he draw back, my soul hath no pleasure in him.</span> In these verses, after the manner of the Epistle, what is being urged is supported by an Old Testament quotation (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3, 4</a>), its drift being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the certainty, notwithstanding delay, of the fulfillment of the Divine promise; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the necessity meanwhile of continuance in faith and perseverance. The quotation serves also as a step of transition (this, too, after the Epistle's manner) to the disquisition on <span class="accented">faith</span>, which forms the subject of the following chapter. For the prophet speaks of <span class="accented">faith</span> as what the righteous one is to live by until the Lord come. It was <span class="accented">faith -</span> a fuller faith - that the Hebrew Christians wanted to preserve them from the faltering of which they showed some signs; and the requirement of <span class="accented">faith</span> was no new thing - it had been the essential principle of all true religious life from the beginning, and thus is led up to the review which follows of the Old Testament history, showing that this had always been so. The quotation, as usual, is from the LXX., which, in this case as in some others, differs from the Hebrew. But here, as in ver. 29, <span class="accented">supra</span>, the LXX. is not exactly followed. The writer cites freely, so as to apply the essential meaning of the passage to his purpose. The Prophet Habakkuk (writing probably during the long evil days of Manasseh) had in his immediate view the trials of faith peculiar to his own time - violence and iniquity in Israel, and imminence of judgment at the hands of Chaldean conquerors, under which he had cried, "O Lord, how long?" But he stands upon his watch and sits upon his tower, to look out what the LORD will say to him in answer to his difficulties. And the LORD answered him, and said, "<span class="accented">Write</span> the vision, and make it plain upon the tables, that he may run that readeth it. For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie [rather, 'but it hasteth to the end, and doth not lie']: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, and not tarry [or, 'be behindhand']. Behold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him [or, 'behold, his soul is lifted up, it is not upright in him']; but the just shall live by his faith." The drift of this Divine answer, which inspired the song of joyful confidence with which the Book of Habakkuk so beautifully concludes, is, as aforesaid, that, in spite of all appearances, the prophetic vision will ere long be realized; God's promises to the righteous will certainly be fulfilled; and that faith meanwhile must be their sustaining principle.

There is, however, good authority for reading it here after <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (equivalent to "my Righteous One"). None of these variations from the LXX. affect the meaning of the passage, being only such as to point more clearly the intended application. One of the variations of the LXX. from the Hebrew (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc.) does alter the meaning of that particular clause, though not the general purport of the whole passage. The adoption here of the LXX. reading, and still more the fact that the following verse depends upon this reading, is among the strong evidences of the Epistle having been originally written, not in Hebrew, but in Greek.

As to the sense intended here, views differ. There are three possible ones, expressed in the text and margin of the A.V., <span class="accented">substance, ground</span>, and <span class="accented">confidence.</span> The first is understood by the Fathers generally, the idea being supposed to be that, inasmuch as things not yet experienced, but only hoped for, become real to us by faith, faith is metaphysically their substance, as substantiating them to us. So Theophilus: <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and Chrysostom, who illustrates thus: "The resurrection has not yet taken place, but faith substantiates (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) it in our souls." So also Dante, following St. Thomas Aquinas, in a striking passage quoted by Delitzsch ('Paradise,' 24:70-75) - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Le profonde cose<br />Che mi largiscon qui la lor parvenza<br />Agli occhi di laggiu son si nascose,<br />Che l'esser lore ve in sola credenza,<br />Sovra la qual si fondu Palta spene:<br />E pero di sustanza prende Fintenza."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The things profound<br />That here vouch safe to me their apparition<br />From all eyes here below are so concealed<br />That all their being is in faith alone,<br />Upon the which high hope doth base itself:<br />And therefore faith assumes the place of substance."</span> The rendering <span class="accented">ground</span>, which involves only the simpler idea of faith being the foundation on which hope is built, has not much support from the use of the word elsewhere, nor does it seem suitable here. For it is not the things hoped for, but rather our hopes of them that are grounded on our faith. The subjective sense, <span class="accented">confidence</span>, or <span class="accented">assurance</span>, is most in favor with modern commentators, principally as being the most usual one (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>; also <a href="../../par/psalms/38-11.htm">Psalm 38:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-5.htm">Ezekiel 19:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: <a href="../../par/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>). One objection to this sense of the word here is that it is usually followed, when so intended, by a genitive of rite person, not of the thing; though <a href="../../par/ruth/1-12.htm">Ruth 1:12</a> is an instance to the contrary. But apart from this consideration, the consensus of the Greek Fathers is a weighty argument for the retention of the rendering of the A.V. Either rendering, be it observed, gives the same essential meaning, though under different mental conceptions. Faith is further said to be <span class="accented">the evidence</span> of things not seen; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> meaning, not as some take it, inward <span class="accented">conviction</span> of their existence, but in itself a <span class="accented">demonstration</span>, serving the purpose of argument to induce conviction. So Dante, in continuation of the passage quoted above - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"E da questa credenza ci conviene<br />Sillogizar senza avere ultra visa;<br />E pero intenza d'argomento tiene."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"And from this credence it is fit and right<br />To syllogize, though other sight be none:<br />Therefore faith holds the place of argument."</span> Is this meant as a <span class="accented">definition</span> of faith, or only a description of its effect and operation, with especial regard to the subject in hand? Virtually a definition, though not in the strict logical form of one. At any rate, "the constituents and essential characteristics of faith are here laid down" (Delitzsch); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of faith in its most general sense - that of belief in such things, whether past, present, or future, as are not known by experience, and cannot be logically demonstrated. "Licet quidam dicant praedicta apostoli verba non esse fidei definitionem, quia definitio indicat rei quidditatem et essentiam, tamen si quis recte consideret, omnia ex quibus fides potest definiri in praedicta descriptione tanguntur, licet verba non ordinentur sub forma definitionis" (St. Thomas Aquinas, 'Secunda Secundae,' qu. 4, art. 1). Faith, in the general sense indicated, is and has ever been, as the chapter goes on to show, the very root and inspiring principle of all true religion. And be it observed that, if well grounded, it is not irrational; it would rather be irrational to disregard it, or suppose it opposed to reason. Even in ordinary affairs of life, and in science too, men act, and must act, to a great extent on faith; it is essential for success, and certainly for all great achievements - faith in the testimony and authority of others whom we can trust, faith in views and principles not yet verified by our own experience, faith in the expected outcome of right proceeding, faith with respect to a thousand things which we take on trust, and so make ventures, on the ground, not of positive proof, but of more or less assured conviction. Religious faith is the same principle, though exercised in a higher sphere; and it may be as well grounded as any on which irreligious men are acting daily. Various feelings and considerations may conspire to induce it: the very phenomena of the visible universe, which, though themselves objects of sense, speak to the soul of a Divinity beyond them; still more, conscience, recognized as a Divine voice within us, and implying a Power above us to whom we are responsible; then all our strange yearnings after ideals not yet realized, our innate sense that righteousness ought to triumph over iniquity, as in our disordered world it does not yet; - which things are in themselves prophetic; and, in addition to all this, the general human belief in Deity. And when, further, a revelation has been given, its answering to our already felt needs and aspirations, together with the usual considerations on which we give credence to testimony, induces faith in it also, and in the things by it revealed; natural faith is thus confirmed, and faith in other verities is borne in upon the soul; which is further itself confirmed by experience of the effects of entertaining it. In some minds, as is well known, and these of the highest order, such faith may amount to certitude, rendering the "things unseen" more real to them than "the things that do appear." It cannot be said that to accept such faith as evidence is contrary to reason; our not doing so would be to put aside as meaning nothing the deepest, the most spiritual, the most elevating faculties of our mysterious nature, by means of which, no less than by our other faculties, we are constituted so as to apprehend the truth. And we may observe, lastly, that even to those who have not themselves this "fullness of faith," its very existence in others, including so many of the great and good, may surely be rationally accepted as evidence of realities corresponding to it.

Thus is introduced the illustrative review of Old Testament instances, the purpose of which has been explained above. It begins from the beginning, Abel being the first example. But in the Old Testament the account of the creation precedes that first recorded instance; and, therefore, it is in the first place fittingly referred to, the existence of an unseen creative power mentally perceived beyond things visible, being the primary article - the very foundation - of all religious faith (cf. below, ver. 6).

Even without a revelation to declare this, faith's office is to apprehend it from observation of the phenomena themselves; as is intimated in <a href="../../par/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>, where even to the Greek "<span class="accented">the</span> invisible things of God from the creation of the world" are said to be "clearly seen, being understood [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>: cf <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in the passage before us] by the things that are made, <span class="accented">even</span> his eternal power and Godhead." The drift of both passages is the same, viz. this, and no more - that faith recognizes an unseen power and Godhead behind, and accounting for, the seen universe. Commentators, who - taking <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and hence seeking to explain what is meant by "non-apparent things" - perceive here a reference either to the formless void (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>) out of which the present creation was evolved, or to the Platonic conception of eternal ideas in the Divine mind, read into the text what is not there. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which</span> (<span class="accented">i.e. faith</span>, not <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, "faith" being the ruling idea of the whole passage) <span class="cmt_word">he obtained witness</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was witnessed of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>that he was righteous, God testifying of</span> (literally, <span class="accented">witnessing upon</span>, or, <span class="accented">in respect to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>his gifts: and through it</span> (<span class="accented">faith<span class="cmt_word"></span>) he being dead yet speaketh.</span> In the traditions preserved in Genesis of the dim and distant antediluvian period, three figures stand out prominently as representing the righteous seed in the midst of growing evil - Abel, Enoch, and Noah. These are, therefore, first adduced with the view of showing that it is in respect of faith that they are thus distinguished in the sacred record. With respect to Abel, it is not necessary to inquire or conjecture whether the bloody character of his offering is to be considered as constituting its superior excellence. The record in Genesis simply represents the two brothers as offering each what he had to offer in accordance with his occupation and pursuits, the only difference being that Abel is said to, have offered <span class="accented">his firstlings</span> and the fat thereof, while nothing is said of Cain having brought his first fruits or his best. Then, in the account of the result, we are only told that unto one the LORD had respect, and not to the other, without mention of the reason why. It is usual to find a reason in the nature of Abel's offering as signifying atonement, and to suppose his faith manifested in his recognition of the need of such atonement, signified to him, as has been further supposed, by Divine command. This view of the intention of the narrative is indeed suggested by the description of what his offering was, viewed in the light of subsequent sacrificial theory; but it is not apparent in the narrative taken by itself, or in the reference to it in the passage before us. The acceptableness of the offering is here simply attributed, as of necessity, to the faith of the offerer, without any intimation of how that faith had been evinced. And with this view of the matter agrees the record itself, where it is said that "unto Abel and his offering the LORD had respect;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to Abel first, and then to his offering - the offering was accepted because Abel was, not Abel on account of his kind of offering. "Crone quod datur Deo ex dantis mente pensatur... Neque enim sacrum eloquimn dicit, Respexit ad munera Abel et ad Cain mqnera non respexit, sed prius air quid respexit ad Abel, ac deinde subjunxit, 'et ad munera ejus.' Idcirco non Abel ex muneribus, sed ex Abel munera oblata placuerunt" (St. Gregory, quoted by Delitzsch). "And he being dead," etc., refers plainly to <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground." The same voice of innocent blood, which appealed at the beginning of human history to the God of righteousness, cries still through all the ages; it sounds in our own cars now, telling us that faith prevails on high, and that "right dear in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints." Cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> for an allusion again to the cry of the blood of Abel. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is there also used, supporting the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, rather than the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the Textus Receptus here.

Hence the emendation, "moved with godly fear," in the recent "Revised Version." But, inasmuch as the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> has in the New Testament, as elsewhere, only its original import of caution or circumspection, there is no need to suppose here a further meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>, the only other passage in the New Testament where the verb occurs). Ebrard, taking only prudent forethought to be expressed, enlarges on the lesson thus conveyed to the effect that he who acts on simple faith, regardless of the world's opinion or of ridicule, is the one who is truly prudent. And we may add that such prudence legitimately comes in as a motive in the religious life. The antecedent of "which" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), though the ancients generally understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, is taken as above by most moderns; the reason being, not only that <span class="accented">faith</span> (see in ver. 4) is the ruling idea of the whole passage, but also that it suits better the expressed results, especially the second, "became heir," etc. For to say that he became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith through the ark, as being the evidence of his faith, or as being the means of his preservation, is less intelligible than to say that through faith he became so. The sense in which Noah "condemned the world" is illustrated by <a href="../../par/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41, 42</a>, "The men of Nineveh," etc., "The queen of the <span class="accented">South</span>," etc. (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2-27.htm">Romans 2:27</a>). His becoming "heir," etc., rests on the view of the fulfillment of primeval promise being transmitted as an inheritance to the faithful. Noah, as he appears in Genesis, was eminently heir in this sense, as alone in his day appropriating it and as transmitting it to his seed. In like manner Abraham, who is next mentioned, was the prominent heir among the subsequent patriarchs (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>). The idea running through the whole Old Testament is that, in the midst of a sinful world, an inheritance of salvation was transmitted through a chosen seed, till the Christ should come as the "Heir of all things," the perfected Head and Representative of all redeemed humanity. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as that of which Noah was heir, may have been suggested with reference to him by his being the first who is called <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, and by this being his usual designation (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>; Ecclus. 44:17; Wisd. 10:4, 6, Sir. 44:17; cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>).

St. Paul, indeed, does not use this exact phrase, but <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>); but still the meaning may be the same. The correspondence is an instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle, while the difference of phrase affords a presumption, though by no means in itself conclusive, against Pauline authorship.

Yet "he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief... being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform" (see <a href="../../par/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-23</a>, which is a fuller statement of the idea of this verse, including the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> to express effeteness, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, corresponding to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span> here. This is a further instance of Pauline thought in this Epistle - ideas already enlarged on by St. Paul being taken for granted as understood.) In Romans Abraham's faith in this regard is treated as typifying Christian faith in the resurrection from the dead (ver. 24), as is also, in the chapter before us (ver. 19), his faith displayed on the occasion of the offering of Isaac. For to us also our inability to conceive the mode of accomplishment of what well-grounded faith assures us of is no just cause for staggering. "How are the dead raised up? and with what kind of body do they come?" was asked by the Corinthian doubters. St. Paul directs them, in reply, to faith in "the power of God" (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/12-24.htm">Mark 12:24</a>) to accomplish his purposes and fulfill his promises in ways unknown to us, transcending, though analogous to, the mysterious processes of nature that we see before our eyes. For "with God all things are possible." Sarah is here joined with Abraham, as also "receiving power" by faith, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> her own faith, as the structure of ver. 11 seems evidently to imply. But how is this consistent with the account of her in Genesis, where she is nowhere held up as an example of faith; nay, is censured for incredulity (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-12.htm">Genesis 18:12-16</a>) with respect to the promise cf. offspring? The answer may be that her temporary unbelief is concluded to have been succeeded by faith, as proved by the result, viz. that she "<span class="accented">received</span> power." And, indeed, her laughter recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>, does not seem intended to imply any permanent "heart of unbelief;" for even Abraham had laughed as she did when the same announcement had been previously made to him (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-17.htm">Genesis 17:17</a>), and the "<span class="accented">laughter"</span> associated with her memory has quite a different meaning given it when that of temporary incredulity was changed into that of joy on the birth of the promised son, who was consequently called Isaac (equivalent to "laughter"). It <span class="accented">is</span>, however, Abraham himself who is put prominently before us as the great example of faith; Sarah is only introduced by his side (with the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span>) as sharing it and cooperating to the result.

In their history as given in Genesis, as, indeed, in the Old Testament generally (at any rate, in the earlier books), there <span class="accented">is, as is</span> well known, no distinct recognition of the life to come. The promise to Abraham seems to imply only an innumerable seed, its possession as a great nation of the earthly land of promise, and through it some undefined blessing to all the families of the earth. Nor are the patriarchs represented as looking forward to a fulfillment of the promise beyond the limits of the present world. Even so their history is singularly instructive. They lived in hope of things not seen through faith in the Divine promise. The very fact that they were content to die without themselves attaining, if so <span class="accented">God's</span> purpose might be accomplished to their seed, invests them with a peculiar grandeur of <span class="accented">unselfishness.</span> Their faith was essentially the same principle as that of Christians, even though the final object of Christian hope were hidden from their eyes; while their dwelling in tents as strangers, and the home and city seen afar off, are apt emblems of the present life and the heavenly citizenship of Christians. It may be that this is all that is intended in the Epistle, the history being allegorized, as that of Isaac and Ishmael is in the Epistle to the Galatians. If so, the apparent attribution of a heavenly hope to the patriarchs themselves must be accounted for by a blending of the actual history with its ideal meaning, such as was observed in the chapter about Melchizedek. But it is difficult to understand the expressions used as implying no more than this. Abraham is said to have himself looked for the "<span class="accented">city</span> that hath the foundations," of which God is the Builder - a description which cannot but denote the "<span class="accented">heavenly Jerusalem</span>," of which the city whose foundations were on the holy hills below is regarded elsewhere as but a type and emblem (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-14.htm">Hebrews 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>; also <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-2.htm">Hebrews 8:2</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is said of the <span class="accented">heavenly</span> tabernacle). <span class="accented">This</span> interpretation is further supported by our finding in Philo similar views of a heavenly counterpart to Jerusalem as the final object of Israel's hope. Again, the country desired by the patriarchs is, in ver. 16, distinctly called a heavenly one. Nor is the view at all untenable that, notwithstanding the silence of the ancient record on the subject, they did look forward to a life after death with God, seeing in the promised earthly inheritance an emblem and earnest of a heavenly one. Well known is Bishop Warburton's argument that a belief in a future state, which was so ancient and universal, and so prominent especially in the religion of Egypt must almost of necessity have been shared in by the race of Abraham, and hence that the silence about it in the Mosaic record must be due, not to its absence from the creed of Israel, but to the peculiar purpose of the Mosaic dispensation. Worthy of attention also are Dean Stanley's words (Lect. 7. on 'Jewish Church') "Not from want of religion, but (if one might use the expression) from excess of religion, was this void left. The future life was not denied or contradicted, but it was overlooked, set aside, overshadowed, by the consciousness of the living, actual presence of God himself." But though such void there is, however to be accounted for, there are still, even in the Pentateuch (as certainly in the Psalms and prophets), occasional glimpses of the hope of immortality. The mystic tree of life in the midst of the garden, the predicted bruising, of the serpent's head, the mystery of Enoch's departure from the world, and notably (as our Lord himself points out) God still calling himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob after they had been long ago gathered to their fathers, are intimations, even in the Pentateuch, of a belief in man's immortal hopes. And it may be added, with reference to the history immediately before us, that Jacob's application of the idea of his being a" sojourner " - used by Abraham with reference to the abode in Palestine - to the whole course of his life upon the earth, in itself suggests the meaning attached to such language in the Epistle. Hence no violence is done to the meaning of the history rather it may be that its deeper meaning is brought out, if the patriarchs are regarded as entertaining a hope of a heavenly inheritance to themselves, and seeing beyond the earthly types. But even f we suppose such immortal hopes as having been in them at the most but vague and dim, still their faith in and longing for a fulfillment of the promise in any sense was really a longing and reaching after the eternal realities which the first fulfillment typified. Compare the view taken in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4.htm">Hebrews 4</a>. of the meaning of "<span class="accented">God's</span> rest." Delitzsch thus enunciates this view of the passage before us: "The promise given to the patriarchs was a Divine assurance of a future rest. That rest was connected, in the first instance, with the future possession of an earthly home; but their desire for that home was at the same time a longing and a seeking after Him who had given the promise of it, whoso presence and blessing alone made it for them an object of desire, and whose presence and blessing, however vouchsafed, makes the place of its manifestation to be indeed a heaven. The shell of their longing might thus be of earth; its kernel was heavenly and Divine, and as such God himself vouchsafed to honor and reward <span class="accented">it."</span> From the general mode of life of the patriarchs the review now passes to particular acts of faith, beginning with Abraham's memorable one, the offering of Isaac.

For, in ver. 18, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;</span> is more naturally connected with the immediate antecedent, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, than with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>: and, in ver. 19, there is no need to supply "him" after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>: the Greek seems obviously to express belief in God's general power to raise from the dead, not his power in that instance only. The offering of Isaac (specially instanced also by St. James, if. 21), stands out as the crowning instance of Abraham's faith. The very son, so king expected, and at length, as it were, supernaturally given, - he in whose single life was bound up all hope of fulfillment of the promise, was to be sacrificed after all, and so seemingly all hope cut off. Yet Abraham is represented as not hesitating for a moment to do in simple faith what seemed God's will, and still not wavering in his hope of a fulfillment somehow. Such faith is here regarded as virtually faith in God's power even to raise the dead. (For a similar view of Abraham's faith as representing "the hope and resurrection of the dead," comp. <a href="../../par/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17, 24</a>.) The expression, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called" (literally, "In Isaac shall be called to thee a seed"), quoted from <a href="../../par/genesis/21-12.htm">Genesis 21:12</a>, means, not that the seed should be called after the name of Isaac, but that the seed to be called Abraham's should be in Isaac, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his issue. The concluding phrase, "Whence also he received him in a figure" (literally, "in a <span class="accented">parable</span>," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>), has been variously interpreted. Notwithstanding the authority of many modern common-taters, we may certainly reject the view of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span> carrying here the sense borne by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, that of venturing or exposing one's self to risk, or that of the adverb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, unexpectedly. Even if the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span> could be shown by any instance to bear such senses, its ordinary use in the New Testament as well as in the LXX. must surely be understood here. It expresses (under the idea of comparison, or setting one thing by the side of another) an illustration, representation, or figure of something. Its use in this sense in the Gospels is familiar to us all; elsewhere in the New Testament it occurs only in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>, where the "first taber<span class="accented">nacle"</span> is spoken of as a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>. Still, the question remains of the exact drift of this expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>. It surely is, that, though Isaac did not really die, but only the ram in his stead, yet the transaction represented to Abraham an actual winning of iris son from the dead; he did so win him in the way of an acted parable, which confirmed his faith in God's power to raise the dead as much as if the lad had died. For such use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> we may compare <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which may mean (notwithstanding the different view of it given doubtfully by the distinguished commentator on the Epistle in the 'Speaker's Commentary'), "We see, not actually, but in the way of an enigmatical representation, as through a mirror." The above seems a mere natural meaning of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc7;</span>, than that of the commentators who interpret it "in such sort as to be a parable or type of something else to crone," viz. of the death and resurrection of Christ. It does not, of course, follow that the transaction was not typical of Christ, or that the writer does net so regard it; we are only considering what his language fit itself implies. Rendered literally, and with retention of the order of the words, the sentence runs: "From whence [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the dead] him [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Isaac, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> being slightly emphatic, as is shown by its position in the sentence, equivalent to <span class="accented">illum</span>, not <span class="accented">eum</span>; and this suitably after the general proposition preceding] he did too in a parable win [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">sibi acquisivit</span>; cf. ver. 39, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>]." With regard to what we may call the moral aspect of this peculiar trial of Abraham's faith, a few words may be said, since a difficulty naturally suggests itself on the subject. How, it may be asked, is it consistent with our ideas of Divine righteousness, that even readiness to slay his son should be required of Abraham as a duty? How are we to account for this apparent sanction of the principle of human sacrifices? To the latter question we may reply, in the first place, that the narrative in Genesis, taken as a whole, affords no such sanction, but very much the contrary. All we are told is that the great patriarch, in the course of his religious training, was once divinely led to suppose such a sacrifice to be required of him. The offering of sons was not unusual in the ancient races among where Abraham lived; and, however shocking such a practice might be, and however condemned in later Scripture, it was due, we may say. to the perversion only of a true instinct of humanity - that which suggests the need of some great atonement, and the claim of the Giver of all to our best and dearest, if demanded from us. That Abraham should be even divinely led to suppose for a time that his God required him to express his acknowledgment of this need and this claim by not withholding from him as much as even the heathen were accustomed to offer to their gods, is consistent with God's general way of educating men to a full knowledge of the truth. But the sacrifice was ill the end emphatically forbidden by a voice from heaven; to Abraham thenceforth, and to his seed for ever, it was made dearly known that, though God does require atonement for sin and entire submission to his will, he does not require violence to be done to tender human feeling, or any cruel rites.

To those inspired by this spirit even the distant future is realized as present; and faith is not only a condition of such prophetic visions being granted to them, but is also evinced by their trusting the visions as Divine revelations, and speaking with confidence accordingly. The prophet seems as though able himself to control the future by giving or withholding blessing (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>); but it is really that his mind and will are at one with the mind and will of God: a Divine voice speaks within him, and through faith he is receptive of it and gives it utterance. Thus it was that even the future characters, and changing relations to each other, of the yet unborn races of Israel and Edom are represented as having been foreshadowed in the blessings of that dying patriarch. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/11-21.htm">Hebrews 11:21</a></div><div class="verse">By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, <i>leaning</i> upon the top of his staff.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Jacob, when he was a-dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.</span> Here two distinct incidents are referred to, both at the close of Jacob's life. That first mentioned, the blessing of the sons of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>), closely resembles the dying act of Isaac already spoken of, and has a similar significance. In both cases, too, human intention is overruled, in that the younger son obtains the higher blessing; and each patriarch accepts alike the Divine intimation to this effect, thus further evincing faith in a power and a will above his own. The latter part of the verse, "and worshipped," etc., is quoted from <a href="../../par/genesis/47-31.htm">Genesis 47:31</a>, and refers to a previous instance of the dying Jacob's faith, in his charge to Joseph to bury him with his fathers in the land of promise. The reversal in the text of the historical order of the two instances may be because the one referred to first is cognate with the instance of Isaac's faith which has gone before, the other with that of Joseph's which follows. For the benedictions of Isaac and Jacob, when a-dying, expressed faith in revelations made to them about the several races of their future seed; the deathbed charges of Jacob and Joseph expressed faith in the chosen seed's inheritance of the Promised Land. Though in the verse before us Jacob's charge to Joseph, with a view to this inheritance, is not mentioned, yet the quotation from the account of it in Genesis, "and worshipped," etc., would be sufficient, in this concise summary of instances, to recall it to the mind of readers, and so intimate the writer's meaning. The variation of the LXX., which is here followed as usual, from the Massoretic text, in reading "staff" instead of "bed," is due to the ambiguity of the Hebrew word, which has one meaning or the other according to its pointing. "Bed" seems more likely to have been intended, inasmuch as the bed on which the patriarch lay is twice again mentioned (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>) in the account of the closing scene; and we find also a similar expression used of David in his old age (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-47.htm">1 Kings 1:47</a>). Bat the variation is unimportant, the essence of the passage being in the word translated "bowed himself," which in the Hebrew as well as the Greek certainly expresses an act of worship. The only difference is that, according to one rendering, this worship was expressed by his bowing over the staff on which he leant as he sat upon the bed (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-2.htm">Genesis 48:2</a>); according to the other, by his turning round to prostrate himself with his head upon the pillow. The view of some of the Fathers, who, adopting the LXX. rendering and supposing the staff to be Joseph's, regard the act as expressing reverence to Joseph himself, in fulfillment of Gem 38:5-11, has little probability in its favor, and is controverted by St. Augustine. But so Chrysostom, and apparently Theodoret. And suitably to this idea, the Vulgate has in Hebrews, "et adoravit fastigium virgae ejus," though in Genesis, "adoravit Israel Deum, conversus ad lectuli caput." Quite untenable, and only worthy of mention because of the use that has been made of it in support of image-worship, is the idea that Joseph's staff was surmounted by some sacred image which Jacob adored.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24</a></div><div class="verse">By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter; choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in</span> (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Egypt; for he had respect unto</span> (literally, <span class="accented">looked away to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the recompense of reward.</span> As in the speech of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7.htm">Acts 7</a>.), so here, the narrative in Exodus is supplemented from tradition, such as is found also in Philo. Moses' refusal to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his renunciation of his position in the court in order to associate himself with his oppressed fellow-countrymen, is not mentioned in the original history, though it is consistent with it, and indeed implied. St. Stephen further regards his taking the part of the Israelite against the Egyptian (<a href="../../par/exodus/2-11.htm">Exodus 2:11-13</a>) as a sign that he was already conscious of his mission, and hoped even then to rouse his countrymen to make a struggle for freedom. The reproach he subjected himself to by thus preferring the patriot's to the courtier's life is here called "the reproach of Christ." How so? Chrysostom takes the expression to mean only the same kind of reproach as Christ was afterwards subjected to, in respect of his being scorned, and his Divine mission disbelieved, by those whom he came to save. But, if the expression had been used with respect to Christian's suffering for the faith (as it is below, <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>), it would certainly imply more than this; viz. a participation in Christ's own reproach, not merely a reproach like his. (Cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, where there is the further idea expressed of Christ himself suffering in his members.) And such being the idea which the phrase in itself would at once convey to Christian readers, and especially as the very same is used below (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>) with reference to Christians, it must surely be somehow involved in this passage. But how so, we ask again, in the case of Moses? To get at the idea of the phrase we must bear in mind the view of the Old and New Testaments being but two parts of one Divine dispensation. The Exodus was thus not only typical of the deliverance through Christ, but also a step towards it, a preparation for it, a link in the divinely ordered chain of events leading up to the great redemption. Hence, in the first place, the reproach endured by Moses in furtherance of the Exodus may be regarded as endured at any rate <span class="accented">for the sake of</span> Christ, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in his cause whose coming was the end and purpose of the whole dispensation. And further, inasmuch as Christ is elsewhere spoken of as the Head of the whole mystical body of his people in all ages - all to be gathered together at last in him - he may be regarded, even before his incarnation, as himself reproached in the reproach of his servant Moses. Compare the view, presented in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3</a>, of the Son being Lord of the "house" in which Moses was a servant, and the comprehensive sense of "God's house" implied in that passage. Nor should we leave out of consideration the identification, maintained by the Fathers generally (see Bull, 'Def. Fid. Nic.,' I. 1.), of the Angel of the Pentateuch, of him who revealed himself to Moses as I AM from the bush, with the Second Person of the holy Trinity, the Word who became incarnate in Christ. (Cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1-15</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>, read in connection with <a href="../../par/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where the spiritual rock that followed the children of Israel in the wilderness is said to have been Christ.) Whatever, however, be the exact import of the expression, "reproach of Christ," in its application to Moses, it is evidently selected here with the view of bringing his example home to the readers of the Epistle, by thus intimating that his faith's trial was essentially the same as theirs.

The only seeming difficulty is in the expression, "not fearing the wrath of the king," whereas in the history Moses is represented as flying in fear from the face of Pharaoh, who sought to slay him. But the two views of his attitude of mind are reconcilable. The assertion of his fearlessness applies to his whole course of action from the time when he elected to brave the king in behalf of Israel. In pursuance of this course, it became necessary for him to leave Egypt for a time. In this, as well as in staying, there was danger; for the king might pursue him: he might, perhaps, have secured his own safety by returning to the court and giving up his project; but he persevered at all hazards. And thus the apprehension of immediate danger under which he fled the country with a view to final success, was in no contradiction to his general fearlessness. Further, his being content to leave Egypt at all, and that for so many years, and still never relinquishing his design, was an additional evidence of faith, as is expressed by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "he endured."

Nor is this inconsistent with the narrative; for, though they are represented as having cried out in their sore fear, and even reproached their leader for bringing them out of Egypt to die in the wilderness, yet on his exhortation, "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD," they may be supposed to have trusted him, and caught something of the inspiration of his faith. Moses, indeed, stands out as a prominent example (and this is one point in the moral teaching of his history) of the strong faith of one great man, not only availing in behalf of others, but also in some degree infecting a whole community, little disposed at first to make heroic ventures.

Among the judges, Gideon is mentioned first, though he came after Barak, probably as being the most famous hero, as well as more remarkable in the history for faith and heroism. "The day of Midian" is referred to by Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-4.htm">Isaiah 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>) as the memorable triumph of ancient days. Hence (the arrangement of the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of the Textus Receptus being retained) Gideon is first mentioned singly, and is succeeded by two groups - viz. Barak, Samson, and Jephthah, representing the period of the judges generally; then David and Samuel, representing that of the kings and prophets. The deeds enumerated in the following verses need not be appropriated exclusively to particular heroes, but may be rather taken as denoting generally the kind of exploits by which faith was evidenced throughout the history. Some, however, seem to have special references, as the stopping of lions' mouths, and quenching the power of fire, to the incidents recorded in the Book of Daniel. "Escaped the edge of the sword," though peculiarly applicable to Elijah (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10, 14</a>, "have slain thy prophets with the sword, and I, even I, only am left," etc.), has, of course, many other applications. Some see in "out of weakness were made strong" a special allusion to Samson's recovery of his strength, but it is better taken in general reference to the frequent instances of the weak things of this world being enabled through faith to confound the strong, and the few to prevail against the many. Numerous expressions to this effect in the Psalms, when the psalmist rises out of the depths of humiliation and weakness into confident reliance on Divine aid, will suggest themselves at once; and the instances of Gideon, Jonathan, David, and others, will occur readily to the mind. In the four concluding clauses of ver. 34, Delitzsch supposes the Maccabean heroes to be specifically alluded to - partly because of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> being used here, as it is also frequently in 1 Maccabees, in the sense of "encamped army," instead of its proper and usual one of "camp" as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11, 13</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>) This coincidence of usage does add to the probability that the Maccabean history, to which all the expressions are very suitable, was at any rate included in the writer's view. But in the history of Gideon too (<a href="../../par/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2</a>) the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> for the host encamped; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span>. Allusion to Maccabees is more distinctly evident; in ver. 35, as will be seen. The expression, "obtained promises (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," surely expresses having promises fulfilled to them, not merely having promise made to them. "Promises" being in the plural, and without an article, so as to include all prophetic promises even of a temporal character, such as that to David that he should reign instead of Saul, - there is no need here to reconcile the assertion with that of ver. 39, "received not the promise (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>);" on which expression, however, see below.

The latter part is as evidently suggested at least by the narrative of 2 Macc. 7; where it is recorded how, under the persecution of Antiochus Epiphanes, seven sons of one mother were tortured and put to death; how one of them, in the midst of his tortures, having deliverance and advancement offered him if he would forsake the Law of his fathers, courageously refused the offer; and how both they and their mother, who encouraged them to persevere, reiterated their hope of a resurrection from the dead. The "better resurrection" means the resurrection to eternal life by them looked for, which was "better" than the temporary restoration to life in this world granted to the sons of the widow of Zarephath and the Shunammite; while the article in the Greek before "deliverance" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) may be due to the thought of that which is recorded to have been offered to those in the writer's immediate view. There is some doubt as to the exact import of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "tortured"). The usual meaning of the Greek word is" to beat," as a drum is beaten, from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a drum or drumstick: and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "to beat to death." But, inasmuch as the instrument of torture to which Eleazar (whose martyrdom is related in the preceding chapter of 2 Maccabees) was brought is called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (6:19, 28), it has been supposed that the punishment referred to was the stretching of the victims, in the way of a rack, on a sort of wheel called a <span class="accented">tympanum</span>, on which they were then beaten to death, as Eleazar was. So Vulgate, <span class="accented">distenti sunt.</span> The fact that the seven of 2 Macc. 7. were not so martyred, but by fire and other tortures, is not inconsistent with this view; for our author need not be supposed to confine his view to them, but uses the word suggested by Eleazar's case. Whatever be the exact import of the word, the A.V. ("were tortured") sufficiently gives the generally intended meaning.

The mention of "mockings" is prominent in the Maccabean history; "bonds and imprisonments" recall Hanani, Micaiah, and Jeremiah; "they were stoned" recalls Zachariah son of Jehoiada (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-51.htm">Luke 11:51</a>; also <a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34</a>). "They wandered in sheepskins (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and in deserts" peculiarly suggests Elijah (his mantle being called <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX., <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>), though the Maccabean heroes also took refuge in "deserts and mountains" (1 Macc. 2.). "Sawn asunder" (denoting a mode of executing martyrs of which there is no instance in the Old Testament or Apocrypha) most probably refers to a well-known tradition about Isaiah, who is said to have so suffered under Manasseh. Alford thus gives the notices found elsewhere of this tradition: "Justin Martyr 'Trypho,' &sect; 120; Tertullian, 'Cont. Guest. Scorpiac.,' 8, and 'De Patient.,' 14; Origen, Ep. ad African.;' Lactantius, 'Inst.,' 4:11; Ps-Epiphanius, 'Vit. Proph.; Augustine, 'De Civ. Dei,' 18:24; Jerome, on <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-1.htm">Isaiah 57:1</a>." Jerome calls it a "certissima traditio apud Judaeos," and says that this passage in the Epistle was by most referred to the passion of Isaiah. The tameness and apparent inappropriateness of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> ("were tempted") in ver. 36, in the midst of an enumeration of cruel modes of death, has led to a prevalent view that it is a corruption of the original text. Various conjectures have been made, the most tenable being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it is an interpolation, arising kern the repetition by some copyist of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which was afterwards altered to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that it is a substitution for some other word through error in transcription, the most likely conjecture as to the word originally written being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to "were burnt." Either form, especially the latter, might easily be changed to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: and thus death by fire would have been originally included in the enumeration, which was likely to have been the case, especially since it is mentioned prominently in the account of the martyrdom of the seven sons. But, as there is no authority of any manuscript for a different word, this is mere conjecture; though the omission of the word altogether in some few manuscripts and versions, and variations of reading in others, suggest some uncertainty as to the original text. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> if genuine, may possibly have been suggested by alliteration, and by thought of the temptations to apostatize prominent in the account both of Eleazar and of the seven sons.

For though in both passages "the promise," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the great Messianic promise (not "premises," as in ver. 33, <span class="accented">supra</span>), is spoken of - or at any rate, in the case of Abraham, ultimately referred to - yet the verbs used are different and have different meanings, He "obtained" or attained to it, in the sense of having it confirmed and assured to him and his seed (see note on Hebrews 6:15); but he did not actually get it so as to reduce it to possession and enter into the enjoyment of it. The realization of all that is meant by the word here used is, indeed, even to Christian believers, still future (for cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Nay, it is future also in its fullness, even to the saints at rest; for in the passage just quoted it is plainly intimated that the entire fulfillment will not be till "he that shall come" comes; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> till the second advent. The redeemed whose probation on earth is over are indeed, in one sense, said to be already "perfected" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-23.htm">Hebrews 12:23</a>); but still the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is nowhere in the New Testament contemplated till "the end." In the mean time, even the saints under the heavenly altar still cry, "Lord, how long?" and the Spirit and the bride say, "Come, Lord Jesus." The full idea, then, of ver. 40 may be that, according to the eternal Divine purpose, the promise of redemption should not be fully realized till the number of the elect shall be accomplished, and all the redeemed of all ages since the world began shall be gathered together through Christ in one, and God shall be all in all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

It is no valid objection to this view that he could not have been a Leader in this sense to the faithful ones before his coming, referred to in the last chapter; for, as has been before observed (see on "the reproach of Christ," <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-26.htm">Hebrews 11:26</a>), he is regarded as the Head and Leader, in all ages, of the faithful; and in virtue of his future warfare for mankind the saints of old endured and triumphed: - and certainly Christians, to whom the exhortation is addressed, may look to him in an obvious sense as their Captain to be followed. Nor, again, is there difficulty - apart from that of the whole mystery of the Incarnation - in his being presented to us as himself an example of triumphant faith. For he is elsewhere spoken of as having so "emptied himself" of his Divine glory as to have become like unto us in all things, sin except; and thus to have been sustained during his human life by faith in the unseen, as we are. His addresses to the Father (see especially <a href="../../par/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) are strikingly significant in this regard. The expression, "for the joy," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>), does not mean, as some take it, "instead <span class="accented">of</span> the joy which he might have had on earth" (such e.g. as was offered to him by the tempter), but, as is evident from the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "as set against, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the sake of, future joy" (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 16). Such looking forward to joy with the Father and the redeemed after triumph is expressed in the great intercessory prayer-above referred to (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5, 13, 22, 23, 24, 26</a>). It may be here observed that anticipation of reward hereafter is among legitimate human motives to a good life. It may be said, indeed, that the highest virtue consists in doing what is right simply because it is right - in fulfilling God's will, whatever may come of it to ourselves; but the hope of a final happy issue comes properly, and indeed inevitably, in as an inspiring and sustaining motive. Aspiration after Happiness is a God-given instinct of humanity, necessary for keeping up the life of virtue. There may be some so in love with virtue as to be capable of persevering in lifelong self-denial, though without any faith in a life to come. But human nature in general certainly requires this further incentive, and Christian faith supplies it. Nor are those who thus work with a view to future joy to be accused of selfish motives, as though they balanced only a greater against a smaller gain. To the true Christian the grand inspiring principle is still the love of God and of his neighbor, and of goodness for its own sake, though the hope of an eternal reward supports and cheers him mightily. Nor, again, is the joy looked forward to a selfish joy. It is the joy of sharing in the triumph of eternal righteousness in company with all the redeemed, whose salvation, no less than his own, he desires and strives for. And, further, with regard to his own individual joy, what is it but the joy of attaining the end of his being, the perfection God meant him for, and to which it is his duty to aspire? Hence Christ would not have been a perfect Example to man had he not been represented as looking forward to "the joy that was set before him."

The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> to express purpose is common in this Epistle (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 3:5, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: 4:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: 6:16, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>): and the essential sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is discipline or education.

Our earthly parents transmit to us our carnal existence; our spiritual part, in whatever mysterious way derived or inspired, is duo to our Divine parentage; and it is in respect of this that we are God's children and accountable to him. But, as has been intimated above, it is not human spirits only that are here in the writer's view. God is the Father of all "the spirits," whether in the flesh or not; all are of Divine parentage, for God himself is Spirit  - <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>).

The discipline of our earthly fathers was "for a few days," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during our childhood only, since which we have been left to ourselves; and even then not necessarily for our greatest advantage; it was only as seemed good to them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); it might be injudicious, or even capricious. But our heavenly Father's discipline we may trust to be always good for us, and with a definite final purpose. Though there is here no distinctly expressed antithesis to the "few days" of ordinary parental chastisement, yet one is implied in the last clause; for if God's purpose in chastening us is to make us partakers of his own holiness, we may conclude that the discipline will be continued till the end be attained; and thus also a further reason is implied why Christians should not "faint" under even lifelong trials.

But the words themselves are suggested by <a href="../../par/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (LXX.), the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> having been previously used for turning out of the way.

This may have been unintentional, but it is at any rate effective. Delitzsch remarks on it. "The duty to which the writer urges, his, readers is courageous self-recovery m Gods strength. The tone and language are elevated accordingly, and ver. 12 is like a trumpet-blast. It need not surprise us, then, if our author here turns poet, and proceeds in heroic measures." With regard to the purport of this verse, we observe that, while the figure of running is still continued, a new idea is introduced - that of pursuing a straight course with a view to others who are to follow on the same track. "That which is lame (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" denotes the weak and wavering brethren - the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, such as are referred to in <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8.htm">1 Corinthians 8</a>. The expression well suits (specially those among the Hebrew Christians who halted between two opinions  - between the Church and the synagogue (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f1d;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>;). The strong in faith ought to desire and aim at the <span class="accented">healing</span> of such lame ones, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> their being strengthened in the faith, rather than expose them to the risk of apostasy by any wavering of their own.

The exhortation to "peace with all" reminds of the tone of St. Paul's admonitions both in Romans and in 1 Corinthians, where he so strongly warns against dissensions and party spirit, and enjoins tolerance and mutual allowance with regard to the weaker brethren. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ("sanctification") need not be limited (as by Chrysostom) to the idea of <span class="accented">chastity</span>; the general thought implied may be (as expressed by Limborch, quoted by Alford), "<span class="accented">No</span>, dum pact studeat, nimis slits obsequendi studio quidquam contra sanctimonism Christianam delinquat;" but the special allusion to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 16 (as also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>) is evidence that <span class="accented">chastity</span> was especially in the writer's mind, with definite reference to which the word <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a>. The frequent and earnest warnings against fornication in St. Paul's Epistles are enough to show how slow even some in the Church were to recognize the strict code of Christian morality, unknown to the heathen world, and by the Jews very imperfectly recognized, in this regard; and the case of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a>. illustrates how easily such vice might creep into and infect a Christian community without general reprobation. Hence probably the special warning here.

The reference in the speech of Moses is to the future possibility of any "man, or we man, or family, or tribe" turning from the LORD to go and serve the gods of the nations, and so involving, not only themselves, but even the whole people in a curse. The figure is that of a plant being allowed to grow of such a nature at its root as to bear bitter and pernicious fruit. There is no special allusion in the word "bitterness" to disturbance of "peace" by dissensions; for this is not the idea in the original passage, nor is it carried out in the following verses of the Epistle. (Cf. <a href="../../par/acts/8-23.htm">Acts 8:23</a>, "Thou art in the gall of bitterness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)") 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a></div><div class="verse">Lest there <i>be</i> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

Esau is appropriately adduced as a notable instance in the Old Testament of a person thus profane, and especially, in the way of warning, of one who lost irrecoverably the privileges which in his profaneness he had scorned. It is immaterial whether Esau himself is intended to be designated as a fornicator (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) as well as profane (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The essential moral of his history is this: being the firstborn of Israel, and so the primary inheritor of the promises made to Abraham, he set no store by the privilege, and so lost it irretrievably. In early life he so lightly esteemed his birthright as the eldest born (carrying with it, as is supposed, in the patriarchal age, the priesthood of the family, and in his case, as might be presumed, the custody and transmission of the promises) that he parted with it for the gratification of a passing appetite. His words on that occasion expressed the limit of his aims and interests: "Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?" Later in life he nevertheless presented himself to claim the blessing of the firstborn from his dying father, but found that he had been forestalled. It does not appear that he had meanwhile changed his mode of life or made amends for his former carelessness; still, he felt now that he had lost something worth having, and was grieved exceedingly. But not even his "great and exceeding bitter cry" availed then to recover what was forfeited. And so neither he nor his seed had part or lot in the Abrahamic promises: the time of opportunity was gone forever. There is some doubt with regard to the latter part of ver. 17, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as to whether "it" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) in "he sought it" refers to "repentance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) or to "the blessing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to what "place of repentance" means. If "it" refers to "repentance," it is difficult to see how Esau's own repentance can be meant; for not only does seeking repentance with tears seem in itself to imply the capability of it, but also the "great and exceeding bitter cry" to which allusion is made was, not because he could not himself repent, but because he could not get the blessing. Hence, if "it" refers to "repentance," it must be repentance, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> change of mind, in Isaac that is meant, or rather in God, against whose will Isaac could not go; cf. "God is not a man...  that he should repent" (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). Of such change of mind and purpose it may be meant that Esau found no place. This seems to be the view of many modern interpreters, though not of Bengel, De Wette, Bleek, Hofmann, Delitzsch, Alford, or of Luther, Calvin, Grotius, or any of the Greek Fathers. Against it is the consideration that such is not the more obvious meaning of "he found no place of repentance," taken by itself, especially as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is always elsewhere in the New Testament (though not always in the LXX.) used for a person's change of mind with respect to his own misdoings (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 6:6). Difficulty on this ground is removed if, taking the clause, "for he found no place of repentance," as parenthetical, we refer <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, preceding. This is by no means a forced construction of the sentence, and it is supported (as above intimated) by the fact that in Genesis it is the blessing itself that Esau is expressly said to have craved in his "great and exceeding bitter cry:" "Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, <span class="accented">even</span> me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept." Thus we may render either, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> of change of mind in the bestower of the blessing], though he sought it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> such change of mind] with tears;" or, "When he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected (for he found no place of repentance), though he sought it [i.e. the blessing] with tears." If, the latter rendering being adopted, Esau's own repentance be intended, the idea maybe, either that there was no place left in which even a real repentance could avail, or that of a real repentance he had become incapable; for his tears might be those only of vexation and remorse, not expressing any more appreciation than before of the birthright in its religious aspect. Ebrard's remark, that his conduct as related in <a href="../../par/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33</a>, shows "a changed heart," and hence a true repentance, is not to the point. For all that there appears is that he had got over his angry feeling towards his brother; it is by no means implied - rather the contrary - that he would have preferred his destiny to his own, or that his views of life had risen above thoughts of worldly prosperity. We observe, further, that nothing is implied one way or the other as to Esau's own salvation; it is only the privilege of being the patriarch of the chosen seed that he is said to have thus irrecoverably forfeited. But his example is adduced as a warning to Christians with regard to their still more precious inheritance, which does involve their own eternal prospects. The warning to them is similar to those of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>, etc., to the effect that sacred privileges, if persistently slighted, may be lost beyond recovery. And if the passage before us seems to imply, according to one view of it, what the former ones were found not to do, the possible inefficacy of a true repentance, however late, - we may say that, even if this is implied of Esau with respect to his lost blessing, it is not therefore necessarily implied of Christians with respect to their personal salvation; or that, if it is implied of them, it is not till their probation in this life is over that a "place of repentance" in this sense can for them be found no more (cf. the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1</a>, etc.); also <a href="../../par/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/13-24.htm">Luke 13:24</a>, etc.). One of Dr. Newman's Parochial Sermons ("Life the Season of Repentance," vol. 6. 'Sermon' 2) strikingly sets forth this view. See also 'Christian Year' (Second Sunday in Lent), with the appended note: "Esau's probation, as far as his birthright was concerned, was quite over when he uttered the cry in the text. His despondency, therefore, is not parallel to anything on this side the grave."

And then at ver. 25 (as previously in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>.) the tone of encouragement changes again to one of warning, the very excess of privilege being made the measure of the guilt of slighting it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned, with fire, and unto blackness and darkness and tempest.</span> The allusion is to the Israelites approaching Mount Sinai when the Law was given (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a>, whence still more than from <a href="../../par/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19</a>. the whole description is taken, "And ye came near [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, the same word as is used supra, <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>], and stood under the mountain").

Neither may we trans- late, as some would do, "a mountain that might be touched, and kindled fire;" for the original passage in Deuteronomy has "and the mountain burned with fire (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>)."

If so, the main purpose of the word is to contrast the local and palpable mountain of the Law with the ideal Mount Zion which is afterwards spoken cf. Or, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> may here carry with it its common sense of groping after, as in the dark (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), with reference to the cloudy darkness about Sinai, and in contrast with the clear unclouded vision of Zion.

The foundation of the conception is in the Old Testament. When David at length won the citadel of Zion, and placed the ark upon it, it was a sort of primary and typical fulfillment of the promise of rest, seen afar off by the patriarchs and from the wilderness. <a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>, which was sung on that occasion, expresses the idea of the King of glory being at length enthroned there, and his people of clean hands and pure hearts being admitted to stand in the holy place before him (cf. "This is my rest forever: here will I dwell," <a href="../../par/psalms/132-14.htm">Psalm 132:14</a>). In the Psalms generally the holy hill of Zion continues to be viewed as the LORD'S immovable abode, where he is surrounded by thousands of angels, and whence he succors his people (cf. <span class="accented">Psalm</span> 48; 68; 125; 132; etc.). Then by the prophets it is further idealized as the scene and center of Messianic blessings (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/12.htm">Isaiah 12</a>; 25:13; 33; 35; 46:13; <a href="../../par/micah/4.htm">Micah 4</a>; to which many other passages might be added). Compare also the visions, in the latter chapters of Ezekiel, of the ideal city and temple of the future age. Lastly, in the Apocalypse the seer has visions of "Mount Zion" (14.), and "the holy city, new Jerusalem" (21.), with the presence there of God and the Lamb, and with myriads of angels, and innumerable multitudes of saints redeemed. If, in the passage before us, a distinction is to be made between "Mount Zion" and "the heavenly Jerusalem," it may be that the former represents the Church below, the latter the heavenly regions, though both are blent together in one grand picture of the communion of saints. For so in <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>. the hundred and forty-four thousand on Mount Zion seem distinct from the singers and harpers round the throne, whose song is heard from heaven and learnt by those below; while the picture of the holy city in <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. is one entirely heavenly, representing there the final consummation rather than any present state of things. <span class="cmt_word">And to an innumerable company of angels, to the general assembly and Church of the Firstborn</span> (rather, <span class="accented">and to myriads</span>, <span class="accented">the general assembly of angels</span>, <span class="accented">and the Church of the Firstborn</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel</span> (literally, <span class="accented">than Abel</span>). Of the several ways of translating the beginning of the above passage, the best seems to be to take <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by itself as including both the angels and the Church of the Firstborn, and to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> with "angels" only. "Myriads" is a well-known expression for the LORD'S attendant hosts (cf. <a href="../../par/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/30-2.htm">Deuteronomy 30:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>); further, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which throughout the passage connects the different objects approached, comes between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not between <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, and the application of both <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> would seem an unmeaning redundancy. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which in classical Greek denotes properly the assembly of a whole nation for a festival, is peculiarly appropriate to the angels, whether regarded (as in the Old Testament) as ministering round the throne or as congregated to rejoice over man's redemption.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> may be suggested here by the firstborn of Israel, who were specially hallowed to the Lord (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-13.htm">Numbers 3:13</a>), and numbered as such by Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-43.htm">Numbers 3:43</a>), or perhaps still more by the birthright (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of above as forfeited by Esau. God's elect may be called his firstborn as being hallowed to him and heirs of his promises (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>," Israel is my son, <span class="accented">even</span> my firstborn;" and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-9.htm">Jeremiah 31:9</a>, "Ephraim is my firstborn"). They thus correspond to the hundred and forty-four thousand of <a href="../../par/revelation/14.htm">Revelation 14</a>, standing on Mount Zion, being "redeemed from the earth," and having "the Father's Name written on their foreheads;" seen distinct from, and yet in communion with, the saints in bliss, whose voices are heard above. Between them and the spirits of the perfected is interposed, "God the Judge of all;" and this appropriately, since before him the saints on earth must appear ere they join the ranks of the perfected: the former look up to him from below; the latter have already passed before him to the rest assigned them. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("perfected") expresses, as elsewhere in the Epistle, full accomplishment of an and or purpose with regard to things or persons (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-9.htm">Hebrews 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-9.htm">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-40.htm">Hebrews 11:40</a>); the word is used here of those whose warfare is accomplished, and who have attained the rest of God. Their "spirits" only are spoken of, because the "perfect consummation and bliss both in body and soul" is still to come. In the mean while, with respect to the issue of their earthly course, they have been already perfected (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/14-13.htm">Revelation 14:13</a>, "They rest from their labors"). Corresponding to the Lamb in Revelation, there is seen next Jesus the Mediator, through whom is the approach of the whole company to the Judge of all, and the accomplishment to the perfected. The "<span class="accented">new</span> covenant" is, of course, meant to be contrasted with the old one before Mount Sinai, under which there was no such approach or accomplishment. Then "the blood of sprinkling" has reference to that wherewith the old covenant was ratified (<a href="../../par/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>; <span class="accented">cf. supra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18</a>). The blood shed by Christ on earth for atonement is conceived as carried by him with himself into the holy place on high (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>), to be forever "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of sprinkling for effectual cleansing. And this blood "speaketh better things than Abel." His blood cried from the ground for vengeance, with the accusing voice of primeval sin; Christ's speaks only of reconciliation and peace. Some commentators (Bengel in the first place, whom Delitzsch follows)see in this contrast between Sinai and Zion a distinct parallelism between vers. 18, 19 and vers. 22-24; seven objects of approach in one case being supposed to be set against seven in the other, More obvious is the correspondence of the successive clauses of vers. 22-24 to the general ideas connected with the giving of the Law. The two pictures may be contrasted thus - <span class="accented">The Old Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sinai, a palpable earthly mountain, surrounded by gloom and storm. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The angels through whom the Law was given (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-2.htm">Deuteronomy 23:2</a>), unseen by men, but operating in the winds and in the fire (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Israel congregated under the mountain, afraid, and forbidden to touch it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LORD, unapproachable, shrouded in darkness or revealed in fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Moses, himself afraid, and winning through his mediation no access for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The blood sprinkled on the people to ratify the old covenant, but which could not cleanse the conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, inspiring fear. <span class="accented">The New Covenant.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Zion, radiant with light and crowned with the city of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Festal choirs of assembled angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The accepted Church of the Firstborn, with free approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Judge of all, without his terrors, accessible, and awarding rest to the perfected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Divine availing Mediator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ever-cleansing blood of complete atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The voice of that cleansing blood, speaking of peace and pardon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such is the vision by the contemplation of which the inspired writer would arouse his readers, amid their trials and waverings, to realize the things that are eternal. He would have them pierce with the eye of faith beyond this visible scene into the world invisible, which is no less real. If they were perplexed and disheartened by what they found around them - by the opposition of the world and the fewness of the faithful - he bids them associate themselves in thought with those countless multitudes who were on their side. The picture is, indeed, in some respects, ideal; for the actual Church on earth does not come up to the idea of the "Church of the Firstborn;" but it is presented according to God's purpose for his people, and it rests with us to make it a present reality to ourselves.

But the subject is changed: it is God, not the "blood of sprinkling," that is now regarded as speaking to us from heaven. It was God also that warned on earth; not, as some take it, Moses, whom the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> does not suit: of him it is said, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>).

Again, ver. 21, "I will shake the heavens and the earth" (cf. lea. 2:19, 21). The prophecy was uttered with reference to the second temple, the glory of which was to be greater than the glory of the first, in that it should be the scene of the LORD'S final revelation of himself to his people. Its first fulfillment is rightly seen in Christ's first coming (cf. <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-9.htm">Habakkuk 2:9</a>, "And in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts;" and <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple"). But the language used points evidently, even in itself, to a further fulfillment; nor do readers need to be reminded here of the pregnant and far-reaching sense of all Messianic prophecy. "Illustre est testimonium Psalm Newtoni ad Dan. p. 91: <span class="accented">vixque in omni V.T. aliquod de Christo extat vaticinium</span>, <span class="accented">quod non</span>, <span class="accented">aliquatenus saltem</span>, <span class="accented">secundum ejus ad-ventum respiciat"</span> (Bengel). The ultimate reference is what is seen dimly afar off in so many of the prophetic visions - the final dissolution of the whole present order of things, to be succeeded by the kingdom of eternal righteousness (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25</a>, etc.). By the heaven that is to be shaken in that great day is meant, of course, not the eternal abode of God, but that which is created and visible (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 27). This final shaking is set against the local and typical shaking of Mount Sinai in two points of contrast - its extending to the whole creation, and its being once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>); and from the latter expression the removing of the things thus finally shaken is in the next verse inferred. This inference, though not following necessarily from the expression itself, is involved in the general drift of Haggai's prophecy, taken in connection with other cognate ones, in which an entirely new and heavenly order is pictured as rising over the ruins of the old (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-22.htm">Isaiah 66:22</a>, referred to in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7, 10, 13</a>, "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness."

Possibly some of the wavering Hebrew Christians might be becoming less ready to open their doors to the persecuted from fear of "reproach" in Jewish circles. The allusion of the latter part of the verse is evidently to Abraham and Lot (<a href="../../par/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. and 19.). At any time the visits even of our fellow-men may be to us as visits of angels, as being messengers of God's purposes for good when least expected. And especially to be noted are our Lord's own words, "He that receiveth you receiveth me," etc., and "Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me" (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).

Whether or not sufferers themselves now, they must not be forgetful of those that are "As bound with them" seems best taken as expressing the sympathy of one member with another (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-33.htm">Hebrews 10:33, 34</a> and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-26.htm">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>, "If one member suffer," etc.). "As being yourselves," etc., reminds them that they are still in the flesh, and so not only on this account bound to sympathize, but also liable themselves at any time to the like afflictions. Exhortations to personal purity and to contentedness follow next. Of the need, and prominence in the Epistles, of warnings against impurity see what was said on <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>). St. Paul is given to couple covetousness 'rod uncleanness together in his warnings, as cognate sins, and alike incompatible with the kingdom of God (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Greediness, or inordinate desire (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), may be for sensual indulgence or for wealth - the same word is used in both senses; and such <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, whatever its object, is fatal to the spiritual life. So here, after a warning against impurity, comes a like one against covetousness.

But most modern commentators understand it as an exhortation, supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>; and this for the following cogent reasons: it occurs in the midst of a series of exhortations, and is therefore more likely to be one; it is difficult to understand the connected clause, "and the bed undefiled (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)," as a statement; and the exactly similar phrase in ver. 5, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, seems evidently hortatory. Hence we take it to mean "Let marriage <span class="accented">be</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>." Two questions remain - that of the import of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is masculine or neuter. <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> elsewhere, when applied to persons, means "held in honor" (as in <a href="../../par/acts/5-34.htm">Acts 5:34</a>, of Gamaliel); when applied to things, it means "precious" (as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/18-12.htm">Revelation 18:12, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>, of precious stones; in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, of the blood of the Lamb; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>, of promises; <a href="../../par/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>, of "my own life;" <a href="../../par/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7</a>, of the fruit of the earth). Bengel explains thus: "Caelibes, quibus periculum scortationis imminet, hortatur ut matrimonium contrahant, tanquam <span class="accented">pretiosum</span> quiddam agnoscentes, ejusque bone digne utantur. Conf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:4</a>.' And, taking <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> as masculine, he explains further: "Omnesque debent matrimonium magni facere, ut, si quis eo ipse non utatur, alios tamen non prohibeat." According to this view the first clause is an injunction to all to appreciate marriage, the second warns those that are married against any violation of the bond: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> antitheton ad scortatotes, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ad adulteros" (Bengel). But the more natural, and the usual, meaning of the common expression <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "in all things," not "among all persons" (cf. <span class="accented">Jaffa</span>, ver. 18; also <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-9.htm">Titus 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>).

'In the conclusion of the verse "for" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>) suits the drift of the sentence as above understood, and is considered to be supported better than "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) of the Textus Receptus. Observe, lastly, that, in "God will judge," "God" is emphatic, being placed last. Though the kind of sin spoken of is lightly regarded among men, and may escape detection or punishment now, yet certainly <span class="accented">God</span> will judge it (cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>, "God is the Avenger of all such, as we have also forewarned you and testified;" and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>, where fornicators and adulterers are included among those about whom Christians are not to deceive themselves, as though they would "inherit the kingdom of God").

Those who had died as martyrs, and hence, having a peculiar halo round them in the issue of their lives, may be supposed to be especially referred to; such as Stephen the proto-martyr at Jerusalem, James the son of Zebedee, and possibly James the Just, the acknowledged leader of the Jewish Christians. It may be that Peter, the apostle of the circumcision, had also suffered before the writing of the Epistle. This supposition, however, which would involve a date for the Epistle after St. Paul's death also, is by no means necessary. Others, too, may be alluded to of whom we have no record, but whose memory would be fresh in the minds of the readers. But it does not follow that martyrs only are intended. Others also who had died in peace, and whose end had been blessed, might be pointed to as models for the imitation of survivors. Ver. 8 must be taken as a distinct appended sentence, the watchword on which the preceding exhortation is based. Its drift is that, though successive generations pass away, Jesus Christ remains the same - the Savior of the living as well as of the departed, and the Savior of all to the end of time. It may be here observed that, though his eternal Deity is not distinctly expressed - for "yesterday" does not of necessity reach back to past eternity - yet the sentence can hardly be taken as not implying it. For his unchangeableness is contrasted with the changing generations of men, as is that of Jehovah in the Old Testament (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2-4</a>), and surely such language would not have been used of any but a Divine Being.

The faith, which was their faith, remains unchanged, as Jesus Christ remains unchanged; why, then, these doctrines, new and strange (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-10</a>)? What these doctrines were is not shown, except so far as is intimated by the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("meats"), which reminds us at once of similar warnings in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/14-2.htm">Romans 14:2, 14, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 16</a>-723; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>). These passages seem to refer in the first place to purely Jewish distinctions, still held to by Jewish Christians, between dean and unclean or polluted meats; and further to a new kind of asceticism, not found in the Old Testament, but based probably on notions of the impurity of matter, which led to entire abstention from flesh or wine, and also in some (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-3.htm">1 Timothy 4:3</a>) from marriage; also, as appears from the passage in Colossians, a false philosophy about angels and the spiritual world. We may perceive in these allusions the germs at least of later Gnostic heresies, such as found (as that of the Ebionites) their first congenial soil in Jewish circles; Oriental theosophy, or neo-Platonic philosophy, being supposed to have been engrafted on Jewish modes of thought. Some, misled by what is said in ver. 10, see in the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> an allusion to those sacrifices of the Law which were eaten by the worshippers, against any fancied obligation to partake in which the readers are supposed to be warned. But the word is never so applied in the Old Testament or the New (see above, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-34.htm">Leviticus 11:34</a>; 1 Macc. 1:16; <a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15, 20</a>, 31; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-13.htm">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8, 13</a>); nor would such error be likely to be classed among "strange doctrines." The drift of the warning is that the religion of the gospel does not consist in any of these notions or observances, the supposed importance of meats being specially noted, and that to make them its essence is a misconception of its whole meaning, and a departure from the faith: "For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a></div><div class="verse">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</span> Here there is a plain allusion to the eating of offered sacrifices. If, then, there was no such allusion in the preceding verse, what is the connection of thought? It appears to be this: "Some would teach you that meats are of religious importance. Nay, but what are meats to us who have Christ himself for our spiritual food? This is our peculiar privilege, not shared by the very priests of the old dispensation." Then, in ver. 11, "That this is so is shown by the very symbolism of the Day of Atonement." Then, in ver. 12, "Let us, then, be well content to leave Judaism entirely, and cleave to Christ alone." By "those that serve (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) the tabernacle" are meant the priests of the Law, whose service is, as in former passages, referred to as still going on.

Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.</span> The allusion is to the sin offerings on the Day of Atonement - the bullock for the high priest, and the goat for the people. Of the flesh of some sacrifices of ordinary peace offerings - the people ate, being themselves "partakers of the altar;" that of ordinary sin offerings was partaken of by the priests alone: but the special sin offerings of the great day, which typified complete atonement, and the blood of which alone was taken into the holiest of all, were consumed entirely by fire without the camp, and not even the priests might eat of them (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>, etc.). This part of the ceremonial, not mentioned in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9.htm">Hebrews 9</a>, completed the symbolism of the Day of Atonement. It not only typified (together with the other goat that was set free) the entire removal of sin from the congregation; it also signified that the Law itself made none, not even the priests, partakers in such complete atonement. Christ fulfilled the first significance of this type by suffering "without the gate;" the Jews, in casting him out from their midst, were the unconscious instruments of his so fulfilling it; he thus bare and took away the sins of all outside the holy city which represented the Israel of God. But further, in him is supplied what under the Law was wanting; for of him, the true Sin Offering, we may all partake: he declared this himself when he spoke of our caring his flesh and drinking his blood - in which words the mention of the blood as well as of the flesh is peculiarly significant; for of the blood, which was "given upon the altar to make atonement for sins" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), none might in any case under the Law partake; but of him we even drink the blood, in token that atonement is completed, and that we are now full partakers in all its benefits. The only seeming discrepancy between the type and the Antitype, as above set forth, is in the order of the different parts of the old ceremonial. The sin offering was slain in the camp <span class="accented">before</span> it was burnt outside, whereas Christ fulfilled both these parts of the type by one act upon the cross outside. Again, the blood of the sin offering was taken into the holy of holies <span class="accented">before</span> the body was consumed by fire outside, whereas Christ entered the heavenly sanctuary "<span class="accented">with</span> his own blood" <span class="accented">after</span> he had suffered "without the gate." But the general significance of the symbolism in its several parts is not thus disturbed; it is viewed as a whole, and all parts of it are found to be fulfilled. In saying, "we have an altar," and implying that we eat of it, the writer has surely the Eucharist in view, though it does not follow that <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means definitely the table on which it is celebrated. He may, as some explain, have especially in his mind the cross on which the sacrifice was once for all completed; or he may have had no definite local image before him, seeing rather (as elsewhere in the Epistle) in spiritual realities and relations the counterparts of the Levitical symbols. But that the Holy Communion is alluded to, even if it were not apparent here, might be concluded from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14-22</a>, where similar phrases are used with distinct reference to it. There St. Paul is dissuading from participation in heathen sacrificial feasts, as being inconsistent with partaking of the Holy Communion; and he says in this connection, "Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) partakers of the altar (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> It is evident that "partakers of the Lord's table" (ver. 21) are regarded as being thereby partakers of the Christian altar, of which mention is made in the text before us.

Both terms were so applied from very early times. The holy tables in our churches are altars, in that on them is continually commemorated and pleaded the one sacrifice of the cross, and that from them the spiritual food of the body and blood is given to the faithful.

In the psalms it is used to express generally praise and thanksgiving (see <a href="../../par/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>:14, 23; 116:17. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, etc.). In virtue of their participation in the true and complete Sin Offering, Christians may fulfill this part of the ancient symbolism, not occasionally, but "continually;" bringing to God, not fruits of the earth, but the "fruit of the lips" (an expression found in <a href="../../par/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> continual praise, springing from thankful hearts. In the Eucharist especially (hence so called) such sacrifice is continually offered, over the one atoning Sacrifice which is pleaded and partaken cf. But not in communions only, but ever in their daily lives, such "sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving" is due. But, as the next verse reminds the readers, the "<span class="accented">knit</span> of the lips" is not enough; there is a further sacrifice of our own, whereby we must show that we are true partakers of Christ, and truly thankful.

The word itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) which is here used might, indeed, denote any persons who took the lead in the congregations; but the urging of the duty of <span class="accented">submission</span> to them, in virtue of their office of watching for souls for which they would have to give account, shows plainly that a special order is here, as elsewhere, referred to. Observe also below, ver. 24, where "<span class="accented">all</span> the saints," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> what we should call the laity, are mentioned in distinction from the <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. (For similar injunctions, cf. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> being the words there used.) The special injunction here to obey and submit may have been called for by some deficiency in this respect among the Hebrew Christians. Possibly it was among the people rather than the pastors that there were any signs of wavering between the Church and the synagogue, and that one purpose of the admonition is to strengthen the hands of the former, in whom confidence is placed.

So probably the writer here, especially as there is a transition to the singular in the following verse. Whoever he was, he associates himself in sending the Epistle with his fellow-laborers, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with others of what we may call the Pauline circle, who were engaged with him elsewhere. Both this and the request for prayer, and also the assertion of integrity, which seems to imply suspicion of possible mistrust, are quite in St. Paul's way, and confirm the view that, though the author may not have been St. Paul himself, it was at any rate some one who was, or had been, closely connected with him.

What circumstances, whether of imprisonment or other hindrances, were in the way of his revisiting them does not appear. We remark that this verse again reminds us strongly of St. Paul (cf. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-22.htm">Philemon 1:22</a>). The possibility may be here noted (see Introduction, p. 12.) that, if the Epistle was composed by one of St. Paul's friends, and sent under his authority, he may have himself dictated this concluding portion (beginning possibly at ver. 17) which is in a more epistolary style than the rest, and contains personal allusions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a></div><div class="verse">Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep through</span> (literally, in) <span class="cmt_word">the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus, make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to God, the subject of the sentence) <span class="cmt_word">be glory forever and ever.</span> <span class="cmt_word">Amen</span>. It is St. Paul's way also to introduce, in the end of his Epistles, a solemn prayer or benediction, couched in terms suitable to the subjects that have been dwelt on (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>, etc.). The term, "God of peace," is also usual with him; and it is appropriate here after so many warnings against disturbing the Church's peace; as is, with reference also to what has gone before, "make you perfect" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), and what follows. On "the great Shepherd," etc., Bengel says, "Habemus, inquit, antistites multos, ver. 17, sed hic omniam est Antistes. Ego sum absens, ver. 19, sed DEUS non abest, neque deerit." The expression is taken from <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-11.htm">Isaiah 63:11</a>, "Where is he that brought them out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; LXX.)." The reference in Isaiah is to Moses and the Red Sea, the well-known types of Christ and his resurrection, and of ours to a new life, leading to eternal life, through him. He is called "the <span class="accented">great</span> Shepherd," as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a> the "great High Priest," as being the true fulfillment of the ancient types. "In [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'in virtue of'] the blood of the covenant" seems to be suggested by <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-11.htm">Zechariah 9:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being added (as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> before) to distinguish the new covenant from the old. The suitableness of the words to the contents of the Epistle is obvious. It is observed that the above is the only distinct allusion in the Epistle to Christ's resurrection, the writer's treatment of his subject having led him to pass at once from the sacrifice to the heavenly intercession. But "non concludit apostolus, autequam menti-onem fecerit <span class="accented">resurrectionis</span> Christi" (Bengel).

Some little apprehension is implied (cf. ver. 18) of the admonitions not being taken well by all. Though the Epistle is not short as compared with others, yet it has been compressed with as "few words" as the subject would allow (cf. ver. 11). If, however, this concluding portion of the Epistle was written or dictated by St. Paul himself, as suggested under ver. 19, the "few words" may possibly refer to it only. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/13-23.htm">Hebrews 13:23</a></div><div class="verse">Know ye that <i>our</i> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</span> This allusion to Timothy shows that the Epistle, whatever its exact date, was at any rate written in the apostolic age, before his death. Further, though not proving St. Paul's authorship, it supports the conclusion that the writer, if not himself, was one of his associates, Timothy having been peculiarly his disciple and companion. It seems that Timothy had been, as the readers were aware, in prison; and the joyful news is communicated of his release, and of the prospect of his visiting them. This again shows that the Epistle was addressed to a definite circle of readers. It is observable that the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which does not occur in St. Paul's writings, is, like so many expressions throughout the Epistle, one usual with St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-68.htm">Luke 22:68</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-16.htm">Luke 23:16</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>; where it expresses release from prison or captivity). He uses it also for dismissal of persons on a mission (<a href="../../par/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>); and hence one view is that Timothy's having already set out to visit the Church addressed is all that is here meant. But the other meaning of the word is more likely. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/13-24.htm">Hebrews 13:24</a></div><div class="verse">Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.

They of Italy salute you.</span> The fact that no names are here mentioned, as is usual with St. Paul in sending salutations to Churches he was personally well acquainted with, leads us to infer that there had been no such close association, at any rate recently, between the writer and the readers in this case; or else that a circle of Churches in some locality is addressed. Nothing certain can be concluded as to the writer's whereabouts at the time of writing from the expression, "they of Italy (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)," though it seems to favor the idea, rather than otherwise, that he was in Italy at the time, possibly at Rome. For the phrase means simply "natives of Italy" (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/10-23.htm">Acts 10:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-13.htm">Acts 18:13</a>; all these being, we observe, expressions of St. Luke's); it by no means implies that they had left Italy. In fact, as Delitzsch observes, "if the author was then in Italy, and at the same time was not a native of Italy, he could not have selected a more appropriate designation for the Italian Christians." The Epistle is concluded by St. Paul's accustomed words, which, with some variations, seem to have been appended to all his letters as his authenticating autograph (see <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>, etc.) -

Nor (for the same reason) does it denote various <span class="accented">degrees</span> of prophetic inspiration, but (on etymological as well as logical grounds) the various <span class="accented">portions</span> of the preparatory revelation to "<span class="accented">the</span> fathers." It was not one utterance, but many utterances; given, in fact, at divers times, though it is to the diversity of the utterances, and not of the times, that the expression points. Then the second adverb denotes the various <span class="accented">modes</span> of the several former revelations - not necessarily or exclusively the rabbinical distinction between dream, vision, inspiration, voices, angels; or that between the visions and dreams of prophets and the "mouth to mouth" revelation to Moses, referred to in <a href="../../par/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-9</a>; but rather the various characters or forms of the various utterances in themselves. Some were in the way of primeval promises; some of glimpses into the Divine righteousness, as in the Law given from Mount Sinai; some of significant ritual, as in the same Law; some of typical history and typical persons, spoken of under inspiration as representing an unfulfilled ideal; some of the yearnings and aspirations, or distinct predictions, of psalmists and of prophets. But all these were but partial, fragmentary, anticipatory utterances, leading up to and adumbrating the 'one complete, all-absorbing "speaking of God to us in the SON<span class="accented"></span>," which is placed in contrast with there all. If the subsequent treatment in this Epistle of the Old Testament utterances is to be taken as a key for unlocking the meaning of the exordium, such ideas were in the writer's mind when he thus wrote. "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> pertinet ad materiam, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> ad formam" (Bengel). <span class="accented">Of old</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the ages comprised in the Old Testament record. Though it is true that; God has revealed himself variously since the world was made to other than the saints of the Old Testament, and though he ceased not to speak in some way to his people between the times of Malachi and of Christ, yet both the expression, "to the fathers," and the instances of Divine utterances given subsequently in the Epistle, restrict us in our interpretation to the Old Testament canon. Addressing Hebrews, it is from this that the writer argues. <span class="accented">Having spoken</span>; <span class="accented">a</span> word used elsewhere to express all the ways in which God has made himself, his will, and his counsels, known (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-20.htm">Matthew 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-45.htm">Luke 1:45, 70</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-29.htm">John 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-21.htm">Acts 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-6.htm">Acts 7:6</a>). <span class="accented">To the fathers</span>; the ancestors of the Jews in respect both of race and of faith; the saints of the Old Testament. The word had a well-understood meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-55.htm">Luke 1:55, 72</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-47.htm">Luke 11:47</a>; and especially <a href="../../par/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>). For the double sense of the term "father," thus used, see <a href="../../par/john/8-56.htm">John 8:56</a>, "your father Abraham;" but again, <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>, "If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;" and also <a href="../../par/romans/4.htm">Romans 4</a>. and <a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>. But this distinction between physical and spiritual ancestry does not come in here. <span class="accented">In the prophets.</span> The word "prophet" must be taken here in a general sense; not confined to the prophets distinctively so called, as in <a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>, "Moses, the prophets, and the psalms." For both Moses and the psalms are quoted in the sequel, to illustrate the ancient utterances. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> means, both in classical and Hellenistic Greek (as does the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, of which <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is the equivalent), not a foreteller, but a forth teller of the mind of God, an inspired expounder (cf. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, AEsch., 'Eum.,' 19; and <a href="../../par/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1</a>, "See I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy <span class="accented">prophet"</span>). Observe also the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in St. Paul's Epistles (especially <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>.). In this sense Moses, David, and all through whom God in any way spoke to man, were prophets. On the exact force of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, many views have been entertained. It does not mean "in the books of the prophets,"  -  the corresponding "in the SON" precludes this; nor that God by his Spirit spoke <span class="accented">within</span> the prophets, - this idea does not come in naturally here; nor is "the SON" presented afterwards as one in whom the Godhead dwelt, so much as being himself a manifestation of God; nor may we take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, as simply a Hellenism for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, - the writer does not use prepositions indiscriminately. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, (as Alford explains it) differs from <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> as denoting the element in which this speaking takes place. This use of the preposition is found also in classical Greek; cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, frequent in Xenophon; in the New Testament, cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>.).

For allusions elsewhere to the two periods, cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-35.htm">Luke 20:35</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-12.htm">Titus 2:12</a>. Cf. also in Old Testament, <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where, for "Everlasting Father," Cod. Alex. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. A subject of discussion has been the point of division between the two ages - whether the commencement of the Christian dispensation, ushered in by the exaltation of Christ, or his second advent. The conception in the Jewish mind, founded on Messianic prophecy, would, of course, be undefined. It would only be that the coming of the Messiah would inaugurate a new order of things. But how did the New Testament writers after Christ's ascension conceive the two ages? Did they regard themselves as living at the end of the former age or at the beginning of the new one? The passage before us does not help to settle the question, nor does <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; for the reference in both cases is to the historical manifestation of Christ before his ascension. But others of the passages cited above seem certainly to imply that "the coming age" was regarded as still future. It has been said, indeed, with regard to this apparent inference from some of them, that the writers were regarding their own age from the old Jewish standing-point when they spoke of it as future, or only used well-known phrases to denote the two ages, though they were no longer strictly applicable (see Alford's note on Hebrews 2:5). But this explanation cannot well be made to apply to such passages as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, or to those in the Gospels. It would appear from them that it was not till the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (or, as it is designated in the pastoral Epistles, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of Christ that "the coming age" of prophecy was regarded as destined to begin, ushering in "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). Still, though "that day" was in the future, the first coming of Christ had been, as it were, its dawn, signifying its approach and preparing believers for meeting it. "The darkness was passing away; the true light was already shining" (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-8.htm">1 John 2:8</a>). Hence the apostolic writers sometimes speak as if already in the "coming age;" as being already citizens of heaven (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>); as already "made to sit with Christ in the heavenly places" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6</a>); having already "tasted the powers of the age to come" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>). In a certain sense they felt themselves in the new order of things, though, strictly speaking, they still regarded their own age as but the end of the old one, irradiated by the light of the new. To understand fully their language on the subject, we should remember that they supposed the second advent to be more imminent than it was. St. Paul, at one time certainly, thought that it might be before his own death (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). Thus they might naturally speak of their own time as the conclusion of the former age, though regarding the second advent as the commencement of the new one. But the prolongation of "the end of these days," unforeseen by them, does not affect the essence of their teaching on the subject. In the Divine counsels "one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." <span class="cmt_word">Hath spoken unto us</span> (more properly, <span class="accented">spake to us</span>) in his Son. "His" is here properly supplied to give the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span>. The rendering, a SON, which seems to have the advantage of literalism, would be misleading if it suggested the idea of one among many sons, or a son in the same sense in which others are sons. For though the designation, "son of God," is undoubtedly used in subordinate senses - applied <span class="accented">e.g.</span> to Adam, to angels, to good men, to Christians - yet what follows in the Epistle fixes its peculiar meaning here. The entire drift of the earlier part of the Epistle is to show that the idea involved in the word "Son," as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, is that of a relation to God far above that of the angels or of Moses, and altogether unique in its character. This idea must have been in the writer's mind when he selected the phrases of his exordium. Nor is the article required for the sense intended. Its omission, in fact, brings it out. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> would have drawn especial attention to "the <span class="accented">personage</span> in whom God spake; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> does so rather to the <span class="accented">mode</span> of the speaking - it is equivalent to "in one who was SON." Son-revelation (as afterwards explained), is contrasted with previous prophetic revelations (cf. for omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whom he appointed</span> (or, <span class="accented">constituted</span>) heir of all things; not, as in the A.V., "hath appointed." The verb is in the aorist, and here the indefinite sense of the aorist should be preserved. "<span class="accented">Convenienter</span> statim sub Filii nomen memoratur haereditas" (Bengel). Two questions arise. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Was it in respect of his eternal Divinity, or of his manifestation in time, that the Son was appointed "Heir of all things?" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When is God to be conceived as so appointing him? <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What is the time, if any, to be assigned to the indefinite aorist? In answer to question <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the second alternative is to be preferred. For <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> his eternal pre-existence has not yet been touched upon: it is introduced, as it were parenthetically, in the next and following clauses. <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Though the term Son is legitimately used in theology to denote the eternal relation to the Father expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John, yet its application in this Epistle and in the New Testament generally (excepting, perhaps, the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> peculiar to St. John, on which see Bull, 'Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:4, etc.), is to the Word made flesh, to the Son as manifested in the Christ. And hence it is to him as such that we may conclude the heirship to be here assigned. <p><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> This is the view carried out in the sequel of the Epistle, where the SON is represented as attaining the universal dominion assigned to him after, and in consequence of, his human obedience. The conclusion of the exordium in itself expresses this; for it is not till after he had made purification of sins that he is said to have "sat down," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance; having become (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> not <span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) "<span class="accented">so</span> much better," etc. This is the view of Chrysostom, Theodoret, and the Fathers generally (cf. the cognate passage, <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It seems best to refer the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, not to any definite time, as that of the prophetic utterances afterwards cited, or that of the actual exaltation of Christ, but indefinitely to the eternal counsels, which were indeed declared and fulfilled in time, but were themselves <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;</span>. A similar use of the aorist, coupled with other aorists pointing to events in time, is found in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29, 30</a>. What this heirship of all things implies will appear in the sequel, <span class="cmt_word">By whom also he made the worlds</span>. Interposed clause to complete the true conception of the SON; showing who and what he was originally and essentially through whom God "spake" in time, and who, as SON, inherited. Here certainly, and in the expressions which follow, we have the same doctrine as that of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> of St. John. And the testimony of the New Testament to the pre-existence and deity of Christ is the more striking from our finding the same essential idea under different forms of expression, and in writings differing so much from each other in character and style. He who appeared in the world as Christ is, in the first place, here said (as by St. <a href="../../par/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>) to have been the Agent of creation; cf. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15-17</a>, where the original creative agency of "the Son of his love" is emphatically set forth, as well as his being "the Head of the body, the Church." This cognate passage is of weight against the view of interpreters who would take the one before us as referring to the initiation of the gospel ages; with respect to which view see also the quotation from Bull given below under ver. 3. Here <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to "the worlds," as in the A.V. For though the primary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> has reference to <span class="accented">time</span> - limited in periods, or unlimited in eternity - it is used to denote also the whole system of things called into being by the Creator in time and through which alone we are able to conceive time.

This transcendent idea is conveyed by two metaphorical expressions, differing in the metaphors used, but concurrent in meaning. <span class="cmt_word">The brightness of his glory</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "glory"), though net in classical Greek carrying with it the idea of light, is used in the LXX. for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, which denotes the splendor surrounding God; manifested on Mount Sinai, in the holy of holies, in the visions of Ezekiel, etc.; and regarded as existing eternally "<span class="accented">above</span> the heavens" (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/24-15.htm">Exodus 24:15</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7, 8</a>, etc.). But the full blaze of this glory, accompanying" the face" of God, even Moses was not allowed to see; for no man could see <span class="accented">him</span> and live. Moses was hidden in a cleft of the rock while the God's glory passed by, and saw only its outskirts, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the radiance left behind after it; had passed; hearing meanwhile a proclamation of the moral attributes of Deity, by a perception of which he might best see God (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-18.htm">Exodus 33:18</a>, etc.). Similarly in the New Testament. There also, as on Sinai, in the tabernacle, and in prophetic vision, the glory of God is occasionally manifested under the form of an unearthly radiance; as in the vision of the shepherds (<a href="../../par/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>), the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>, etc.), the ecstasy of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>). But in itself, as it surrounds "the face" of God, it is still invisible and unapproachable; cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> man hath seen God at any time;" <a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>, "God is Light;" <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>, "<span class="accented">Dwelling</span> in the light which no man can approach unto (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), whom no man hath seen nor can see." It denotes really, under the image of eternal, self-existent, unapproachable light, the ineffable Divine perfection, the essence of Deity, which is beyond human ken. "Sempiterna ejus virtus et divinitas" (Bengel). Of this glory the SON is the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> - a word not occurring elsewhere in the New Testament, but used by the Alexandrian writers. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "<span class="accented">to</span> radiate," "to beam forth brightness;" and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, according to the proper meaning of nouns so formed, should mean the brightness beamed forth - this rather than its reflection from another object, as the sun's light is reflected from a cloud. So the noun is used in Wisd. 7:26, as applied to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, which is there personified in a manner suggestive of the doctrine of the <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> And Philo speaks of the breath of life breathed lute man (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>) as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> ('De Spec. Leg.,' &sect; 11). As, then, the eradiated brightness is to the source of light, so is the SON, in his eternal being, to the Father. It is, so to speak, begotten of the source, and of one substance with it, and yet distinguishable from it; being that through which its glory is made manifest, and through which it enlightens all things. The Person of the Son is thus represented, not as of one apart from God, irradiated by his glory, but as himself the sheen of his glory; cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, "We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;" also <a href="../../par/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>. The above is the view taken by the Fathers generally, and expressed in the Church's Creed, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And express Image of his substance</span>; not "of his person," as in the A.V. The latter rendering is due to the long-accepted theological use of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of <span class="accented">personal subsistence</span>, as applied to each of the Three in One. What the Latins called <span class="accented">persona</span> the Greeks at length agreed to call <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>, while the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (equivalent to <span class="accented">essentia</span>) and the Latin <span class="accented">substantia</span> (though the latter word etymologically corresponds with <span class="accented">hypostasis</span>) were used as equivalents in meaning. But it was long after the apostolic age that this scientific use of the word became fixed. After as well as before the Nicene Council <span class="accented">usia</span> was sometimes used to denote what we mean by <span class="accented">person</span>, and <span class="accented">hypostasis</span> to denote what we mean by the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the Godhead; and hence came misunderstandings during the Arian controversy. Bull ('Def. Fid. Nic.,' 2:9. 11) gives a catena of instances of this uncertain usage. The definite doctrine of the Trinity, though apparent in the New Testament, had not as yet come under discussion at the time of the writing of this Epistle, or been as yet scientifically formulated; and hence we must take the word in its general and original sense, the same as that now attached to its etymological equivalent, <span class="accented">substantia. It</span> means literally, "a standing under," and is used <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in a physical sense, for "foundation," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/69-2.htm">Psalm 69:2</a>, "I sink in deep mire where there is no standing," where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> metaphorically, for "confidence" or "certainty," as below, <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-14.htm">Hebrews 3:14</a> and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-4.htm">2 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> metaphysically, for that which underlies the phenomena of things and constitutes their essential being. Of the <span class="accented">substance</span>, understood in the last sense, of God the Son is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, which word expresses a similar kind of relation to the Divine substance as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> does to the Divine glory. Derived from <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (equivalent to "mark," "grave," or "stamp," with an engraven or imprinted character), its proper meaning is the perceptible image on the material so stamped or engraved, of which it thus becomes the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>. Thus the "image and superscription" on a coin is its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, manifesting what the coin is. The instance of the tribute money (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-20.htm">Matthew 22:20</a>) at once occurs to us: our Lord pointed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> on the coin as manifesting its <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, as being Caesar's money. Thus also the lineaments of a countenance are called its <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as in Herod., 1:116, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. A passage in Philo is illustrative of the sense intended; and it is to be observed (both with regard to the expression before us and to the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) that the Alexandrian theologians are important guides to the interpretation of phrases in this Epistle, their influence on its modes of thought and expression being perceptible. He says ('De Plant. Nee.,' &sect; 5) that Moses called the rational soul the image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Divine and Invisible, as being <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Here, be it observed, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is used for the form or lineament of the Divine seal itself, not for the copy stamped on the plastic material. And it is applied, as here, to the "Eternal Word," as being the manifestation of what the unseen Godhead is. Hence it would be wrong to understand the word, as some have done, as denoting the form impressed by one substance on another - as though the impression left on the wax were the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> of the seal. This misconception would mislead (as might also <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, if rendered "reflection") in that it would seem to represent the Son as distinct from God, though stamped with his likeness and irradiated by his glory. Arian views about the SON, or even mere humanitarian views about the Christ, might thus seem countenanced. The two words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span>, as has been said, express a similar relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> respectively, and convey the same general idea of the Son's eternal relation to the Father. But both are, of course, but figures, each necessarily inadequate, of the inscrutable reality. If we may distinguish between them, it may be said that the former especially intimates the view of the operation and energy of the Godhead being through the Son, while the latter more distinctly brings out the idea of the Son being the Manifestation of what the God- head is, and especially of what it is to us. <span class="cmt_word">And upholding all things</span>. We have here still the present participle, denoting the intrinsic operation of him who was revealed as Son. Though the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, in the sense of upholding or sustaining creation, does not occur elsewhere in the, New Testament, it can hardly have any other meaning here, considering the context. We find a similar use of it in <a href="../../par/numbers/11-14.htm">Numbers 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, "<span class="accented">to bear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) all this people alone." And in the later Greek and rabbinical writers parallels are found. Chrysostom interprets <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> as meaning <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which comes to the same thing as "upholding" or "sustaining." The meaning is that not only were "<span class="accented">the</span> worlds" made through him; in his Divine nature he ever "upholds" the "all things" which were made through him, and of which, as SON, he was appointed "Heir;" el. <a href="../../par/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>, "And in him all things consist." And this upholding operation must not be supposed to have been in abeyance during the period of his humiliation. He was still what he had been eternally, though he had "emptied himself" of the state and prerogatives of Deity (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>); el. (though the text is somewhat doubtful) <a href="../../par/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>, "The Son of man, which is (<span class="greek">&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span>) in heaven." By the word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of his power is an expression elsewhere used of the <span class="accented">voluntas efficax</span> of Deity - the <span class="accented">utterance</span> of Divine power; cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-3.htm">Hebrews 11:3</a>, "The worlds were framed by the Word (<span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) of God." The writer could hardly have used it in this connection, if speaking of a created being. As to the reference of "his" before" power," whether to the subject of the sentence or to God, there is the same ambiguity in the Greek as in the English translation. Even if <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> be intended, and not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (and the former is most likely, since the pronoun, though it be reflective, is not emphatically so), it may with grammatical propriety refer either, like the previous <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, to God, or to him who thus upholds all things. In either case the general meaning of the clause remains the same. Enough has been said on the whole series of phrases which is thus concluded to show the untenableness of the Socinian interpretation, which would refer them only to Christ in the flesh and to the Christian dispensation. On such interpretation of the first of them Bull remarks, "Interpretatio Socinistarum, Deum nempe dici per Filiam saecula condidisse, quod per ipsum genus humanum reformavit et restauravit, et in novum quemdam statum transtulit, prodigiosum est commentum. Sane juramento aliquis tuto affirmare possit, ex Hebraeis, ad quos scripta fuit ilia epistola, ne unum quidem fuisse, qui scriptoris verba hoc sensu intellexerit, aut vel per somnium cogitaverit, per <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">saeculaa</span>, significarum fuisse tantum genus humanum, nedum ejus pattem illam, cui tunc temporis evangelii lux effulserat" ('Jud. Eccl. Cath.,' 5:8). <span class="cmt_word">When he had made purification of sins</span>. (So, according to the best-supported 'rod now generally accepted text.) The aorist is now resumed, denoting an act in time - the act accomplished by him as incarnate SON, previous to and necessary for his entering on the inheritance appointed to him as such. This act, the grand purpose of the Incarnation, was <span class="accented">atonement.</span> There can be no doubt that the cleansing effected by atonement, and not the mere <span class="accented">moral</span> reformation of believers, is meant here by <span class="accented">purification of sins</span>. The sequel of the Epistle, being, as aforesaid, the full expression of the drift of the exordium, is sufficient proof of this. For in it Christ is exhibited at great length as the true High Priest of humanity, accomplishing truly what the Jewish priesthood signified; and as having "sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the <span class="accented">heavens</span>," in virtue of his accomplished atonement (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Nor would the Hebrew readers to whom the Epistle was addressed be likely to understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> ("purification") in any other sense than this. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the LXX. equivalent for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, frequent in the Old Testament for ceremonial cleansing, the result of atoning sacrifice; in which sense it is accordingly used in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>. of this Epistle. The theory of the Jewish ceremonial law was that the whole congregation, including the priests themselves, were too much polluted by sin to approach the holy God who dwelt between the cherubim. Therefore sacrifices were ordained to make atonement for them. The word for "making atonement for" (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is in Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, which means properly "to cover;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to cover sin from the sight of God. And the result of such atonement was called "purification," or "cleansing." This appears clearly in <a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>, where the ceremonies of the great Day of Atonement are detailed. After an account of the various sacrifices of atonement, for the high <span class="accented">priest</span> and his house, for the people, and for the holy place itself polluted by their sins, we read (ver. 19), "And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the altar] with his finger seven times, and <span class="accented">cleanse it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), and hallow it from the <span class="accented">uncleanness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">of</span> the children of Israel." And finally (ver. 30), "For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to <span class="accented">cleanse</span> you (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), that ye may be <span class="accented">clean</span> from all your sins before the Lord." It is to be observed, further, that it is especially the meaning of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement that Christ is spoken of afterwards in the Epistle as having fulfilled. For the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Its meaning in the Epistle may be that Christ, by his death, brought into being and established a permanent purification of sins - "a fountain open for sin and for uncleanness" (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a>) - in his blood, which is regarded as now ever offered at the heavenly mercy-seat (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12</a>) and sprinkled on the redeemed below (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14, 22</a>). Thus the distinction, observed above, between the atonement (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), of sacrifice and its application for cleansing (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) would be preserved (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sat down</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> entered on his inheritance of all things; not simply in the sense of resuming his pristine glory, but of obtaining the preeminence denoted in prophecy as appointed to the Son, human as well as Divine, and won by obedience and accomplished atonement. And this his supreme exaltation (as will be seen hereafter) carries with it the idea of an exaltation of humanity, of which he was the High Priest and Representative. But be it observed that there is no change in the subject; of the sentence. He who "sat down on high" after making purification is the same with him through whom the worlds were made, and whose eternal Divinity has been expressed by the present participles. This identification supports the orthodox position of there being but one personality in Christ, notwithstanding the two natures, and justifies, against Nestorian-ism, the term <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;</span> applied to the blessed Virgin, with other cognate expressions accepted in orthodox theology, such as, "God suffered," though in his human, not his Divine, nature; "God shed his blood" (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">On the right hand of the Majesty on high</span>. The expression is taken from <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, afterwards cited in this Epistle, and prominently referred to in like manner by St. Paul. The figure is suggested by the custom of Oriental kings, who placed at the right hand of the throne a son whom they associated with themselves in the prerogatives of royalty. Occurring as it does first in a Messianic psalm, the phrase is never applied to the Son's original relation to the Father "before the ages," but only to his exaltation as the Christ (on which see Bleek). The same idea seems expressed by our Lord's own words, "All authority hath been <span class="accented">given</span> unto me in heaven and in earth" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>). But in the <span class="accented">end</span>, according to St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24, 28</a>), this peculiar "kingship" of the SON will cease, the redemptive purpose being accomplished. It is to be observed that, both here and afterwards (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>), a fine periphrasis is used for "right-hand of God;" "the right hand of the Majesty on high" and "the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." This may be regarded, not only as characteristic of the eloquent style of the Epistle, but also as implying an avoidance of too local or physical a view of the session spoken cf. It is apparent elsewhere how the writer sees in the figures used to denote heavenly things only signs, level to our comprehension, of corresponding realities beyond our ken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-4.htm">Hebrews 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Having become by so much better than the angels as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>). (For the same Greek form of comparison, see <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3</a>.) "<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> ingentem printer caeteros excellentiam denotat" (Bengel). This verse, though, in respect of grammatical construction, it is the conclusion of the exordium, serves as the thesis of the first section of the argument to follow, the drift of which is to show the SON'S superiority to the angels. The mention of the angels comes naturally after the allusion to <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, viewed and quoted as it is afterwards in connection with <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which "<span class="accented">a little lower than</span> the angels" is taken to denote the state <span class="accented">previous</span> to the exaltation; and it is preparatory also for the argument that follows. The more distinguished name, expressing the measure of superiority to the angels, is (as the sequel shows) the name of SON, assigned (as aforesaid) to the Messiah in prophecy, and so, with all that it implies, "inherited" by him in time according to the Divine purpose. Observe the perfect, "hath inherited," instead of the aorist as hitherto, denotes, with the usual force of the Greek tense, the continuance of the inheritance obtained. If we have entered into the view all along taken by the writer, we shall see no difficulty in the SON being said to have <span class="accented">become</span> better than the angels at the time of his exaltation, as though he had been below them before. So he had in respect of his assumed humanity, and it is to the SON denoted in prophecy to be humanly manifested in time that the whole sentence in its main purport refers. As such, having been, with us, lower than the angels, he <span class="accented">became</span> greater, the interposed references to his eternal personality retaining their full force notwithstanding. But why should the name of SON in itself imply superiority to the angels? Angels themselves are, in the Old Testament, called "sons of God." It has been suggested that the writer of the Epistle was not aware of the angels being so designated, since the LXX., from which he invariably quotes, renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. But this is not so invariably. In <a href="../../par/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; and Psalms 89:7, we find <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. And, whatever be the application of the words in each of these passages, they at any rate occur in the LXX. as denoting others than the Messiah. Nor, in any case, would it be easily supposable that one so versed in biblical lore as the writer must have been had been thus misled in so important a point of his argument. The fact is that his argument, properly understood, is quite consistent with a full knowledge of the fact that others as well as the Messiah are so designated. For it is not merely the term "Son" as applied to the Messiah in prophecy, but the unique manner in which it is so applied, that is insisted on in what follows. The form of his commencement shows this. He does not say, "Whom, except the Messiah, did he ever call Son?" but, "To which of the angels did he ever speak as follows, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee?" In language generally the meaning of a word may depend very materially on the context in which it occurs and other determining circumstances. Indeed, the mere use of the title in the singular, "my Son," carries with it a different idea from its use in the plural of a class of beings. But this is not all. A series of passages from the Old Testament is adduced by way of expressly showing that the sonship assigned to the Messiah carries with it the idea of a relation to God altogether beyond any ever assigned to angels. Such is the position of the writer. We shall see in the sequel how He makes it good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>. - THE SON SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS. Here the argumentation of the Epistle begins, the thesis of the first section of the argument having been given, as aforesaid, in the preceding verse, that "the SON is superior to the angels." The second section begins at <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, the thesis being that "the SON is superior to Moses." Through <span class="accented">angels</span> and <span class="accented">Moses</span> the Law was given: "Ordained through angels in the hand of a mediator" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>), the "mediator" being Moses. To show that the Son, in the Old Testament itself, is represented as above both, is to show, what it is the main purpose of the whole Epistle to establish, that the gospel, given through the SON, is above the Law, and intended to supersede it. The conclusion is that the gospel stands in the same relation to the Law as does the Son to angels, who are but "ministering spirits," and to Moses, who was but a "servant." With regard to the agency of angels in the giving of the Law, we do not find it so evident in the Old Testament as might have been expected from the references to it in the New. The "angel of Lord," who appeared to Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and went before the people (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20</a>, etc.), seems in the earlier books of the Bible to signify a certain presence and manifestation of the Lord himself, rather than a created minister of his will (see <a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-15.htm">Genesis 22:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20, 21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-31.htm">Acts 7:31, 35, 38</a>); and this has been identified by theologians with the <span class="accented">Word</span>, not yet incarnate, through whom all Divine communications have been made to men. It is to be observed, however, that, after the sin of the golden calf, a distinction seems to be made between the presence of the <span class="accented">Lend</span> with his people and that of the angel to be thenceforth <span class="accented">sent</span> before them (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2, 3</a>). Ebrard sees in the "angel of the LORD" generally, though understood as signifying a Divine presence, a justification of the statement that the Law was given "through angels," on the ground that, though God did so manifest <span class="accented">himself</span>, it was not a direct manifestation, as in the Son, but through forms borrowed from the sphere of the angels. It was an <span class="accented">angelophany</span>, denoting an unseen Divine presence, not a true <span class="accented">theophany.</span> The only distinct allusion to "angels," in the plural, in connection with the giving of the Law, is in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, "He came with ten thousands of saints;" with which comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>. But there is no doubt that it came afterwards to be the accepted rabbinical view that the dispensers of the Law were angels - whether as attendants on the Divine Majesty, or as agents of the fiery phenomena on Mount Sinai (natural operations being often attributed to angels), or as the utterers of the voice that was heard. "Locutus est Deus per angeles" (Bengel). And the writers of the New Testament plainly recognize this view (see below, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>). Hence our author takes for granted that his readers will understand and recognize it, and so implies it in his argument, expressing, as it does, a true conception of the nature of the Mosaic dispensation, and especially of its relation to the gospel. To resume our view of the argument that follows. The first section (as aforesaid) is from <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a> to Hebrews 3:1, having for its thesis <span class="accented">the superiority of the</span> SON <span class="accented">to angels.</span> The second section is from <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a> to Hebrews 5:1, having for its thesis the superiority of the Son to Moses. Each section consists of two main divisions, between which in each case an appropriate exhortation is interposed; the first division in each case treating of what the Son is in his own person, the second of his work for man; and both sections leading separately to the conclusion that he is the <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> Then, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, the subject of his priesthood is taken up. Ebrard happily illustrates the symmetrical plan of the argument thus: "The author, having thus been led from these two different starting-points to the idea of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, now proceeds to place on the two first parts, which may be viewed as the pillars of the arch, the third part, which forms the keystone." In this third part it begins to be shown, at <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>, how Christ fulfilled in his humanity the essential idea of priesthood. But, for reasons that will appear, the full doctrine of his eternal priesthood is not entered upon till <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-1.htm">Hebrews 7:1 - 10:19</a>, which may be called the central portion of the whole Epistle. The remainder (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a> - end) may be distinguished from the rest as being the distinctly hortatory part (though her-ration has been frequently interposed in the argument), being mainly devoted to practical application of the doctrine that has been established. The following plan of the argument of the first two sections, showing the parallelism between them, may assist us in entering into it as it proceeds: - <span class="cmt_word">SECTION I.</span> <span class="accented">Thesis:</span> Christ superior to the angels. <span class="accented">Division</span> 1 (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5-2:1</a>). The name SON, as applied to the typical theocratic kings, and in its final reference and full meaning (as you all acknowledge) pointing to the Messiah, expresses a position altogether above any assigned anywhere to angels. The Son is represented as one associated with God in his majesty, a sharer of his everlasting throne. Angels are referred to only as ministering spirits or attendant worshippers at the Son's advent. <span class="accented">Interposed exhortation</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1-5</a>). This being so, beware of not appreciating the revelation now given in the Son. In transgression of the Law given through angels was so severely visited, what will be the consequence of neglecting <span class="accented">this</span>, accredited to us as it has been? <span class="accented">Division</span> 2 (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5-3:1</a>). The Son also, but never angels, is denoted in prophecy as Lord of the <span class="accented">coming age.</span> For the eighth psalm (based on and carrying out the idea of the account in Genesis of the original creation) assigns a supremacy over all created things to <span class="accented">man.</span> Man, as he is now, does not fulfill the ideal of his destiny. But Christ, as Son of man, in his exaltation, does. And in him man attains his destined dignity forfeited through sin. His humiliation, suffering and death were for the purpose of thus raising man. His humiliation with this and was a design worthy of God, and in accordance with the purport of Messianic prophecy. For such prophecy intimates association and sympathy of the Messiah with his human brethren. Thus Christ, the SON, is the sympathizing <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> <span class="cmt_word">SECTION II.</span> <span class="accented">Thesis-</span> Christ superior to Moses. <span class="accented">Division</span> 1 (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-7</a>). Moses is represented in the Old Testament as but a <span class="accented">servant in</span> the house of God. The SON is <span class="accented">lord over</span> the house. <span class="accented">Interposed exhortation</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>). This being so, beware of hardening your hearts, like the Israelites under Moses. If they failed, through unbelief, of entering into the rest offered to <span class="accented">them</span>, you may similarly fail of entering into the rest intended for <span class="accented">you.</span> <span class="accented">Division</span> 2 (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1-5:1</a>). A rest, symbolized by that of the promised land, <span class="accented">is</span> still offered to you, and you <span class="accented">may</span> enter into it. The ninetieth psalm shows that the rest into which Joshua led the Israelites was not the final one intended for God's people. The true rest is the rest of God himself (" my rest," <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>.), spoken of in the account of the creation - the sabbath rest of eternity. Christ, after sharing our human trials, has passed into that eternal rest, and won an entrance into it for us. Thus, again, a renewed exhortation being interposed, Christ, the SON, is again set forth as the sympathizing <span class="accented">High Priest of humanity.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For to which of the angels said he at any time</span>. Observe the form of the question, which has been already noticed. It is not, "When were angels ever called sons?" but to this effect: "To which of them did he ever speak (individually) in the following remarkable terms?" The first quotation is from <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; the second from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. The second having had undoubtedly a primary reference to Solomon, and the first presumably to some king of Israel, probably to David, we may here properly pause to consider the principle of the application of such passages to Christ. It must be allowed that, not only in this Epistle, but in the New Testament generally, sayings which had a primary reference to events or personages in the past, are applied directly to Christ; and in some cases where the justness of the application may not be to all of us at first sight obvious. With regard to this usage, Bengel says, "Veri interpretes verborum divinorum sunt apostoli; etiamsi nos sine illis talem sententiam non assigneremur." But such applications are plainly not arbitrary. They rest on a principle of interpretation which it is of importance for us to understand. First, we may observe that the method was not originated by the New Testament writers; it was one received among the Jews of their time, who saw throughout the Old Testament anticipations of the Messiah. This appears both from rabbinical literature and also from the New Testament itself. For instance, the priests and scribes consulted by Herod (<a href="../../par/matthew/2-5.htm">Matthew 2:5</a>) referred <a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> as a matter of course to the Messiah; and the Pharisees (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-44.htm">Matthew 22:44</a>) never thought of disputing the application of <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. to him. And not only so. The Old Testament itself suggests and exemplifies such applications. For students of the prophetic writings must be aware how utterances that had a primary fulfillment in one age are sometimes taken up in a subsequent one as though yet to be fulfilled, their scope enlarged, and their final reference often thrown forward to "that day" - the Messianic age  - which alone terminates the view of the later prophets. Now, it has been said, in explanation of this mode of treatment, that prophecy often had a double meaning, referring partly to one thing and partly to another; or several meanings, with reference to several different things. But this way of putting the matter is unsatisfactory. Bacon better hit the mark, when, in a well-known passage in his 'Advancement of Learning' (bk. 2.), he spoke of "that latitude which is agreeable and familiar unto Divine prophecies, being of the nature of their Author, with whom a thousand years are but as one day, and therefore are not fulfilled punctually at once, but have springing and germinant accomplishment throughout many ages; though the height or fullness of them may refer to some one age." We may put it thus: It was of the nature of prophetic inspiration to lift the seer above and beyond his immediate subject to the contemplation of some grand <span class="accented">ideal</span>, which it suggested to his vision, and more or less perfectly fulfilled. He has, for instance, as the basis of his vision, a David, a Solomon, a Hezekiah, or a Zerubbabel; he has as its framework the circumstances of his own time or of the time near at hand; but we find his language, as he proceeds, rising far above his vision's original scope, and applicable to those comprised within it only so far as they embody and realize the ideal which they represent to his mind. Hence the taking up of old prophecies by succeeding prophets, their enlargement and reapplication to new fulfillments; and this, too, in terms transcending the reality of these new fulfillments; as, for instance, when Isaiah, taking up the idea of Nathan's message to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), applies it apparently to a son and a reign to be looked for in his own age, but at length in language which can have no other than a Messianic reference (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, etc.; Isaiah 11:1, etc.; cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>). Hence, lastly, the application in the New Testament of all such ancient utterances at once to Christ, as being the final and complete fulfillment of the ideal of prophecy, the true Antitype of all the types. A clear perception of this view of the drift of prophecy will remove difficulties that have been felt as to the application of many quotations from the Old Testament, in this Epistle and elsewhere, to Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee</span>; a quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>. This psalm is expressly quoted as David's in <a href="../../par/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>, and has internal evidence of being his, and of having had primary reference to his reign. For the mention of Zion (ver. 6) precludes an earlier date, while the circumstances of warfare alluded to do not agree with the peaceful reign of Solomon, nor the picture of undivided empire with any period after the secession of the ten tribes. Further, the rising and consequent subjugation by David of subject races, described in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>, presents to us a state of things very likely to have suggested the psalm; and to this period of David's reign it is usually referred with probability by modern commentators. But the question of date and authorship is not material to our view of the prophetic meaning of the psalm. Taking it to be David's, we find as follows: There is a rebellious confederation of subject kings against the dominion of the King of Israel, who is spoken of as "the Anointed" of the LORD. In view of their hostile preparations, the LORD in heaven is conceived as laughing to scorn their devices against him whom he himself had enthroned on Zion. Then the king speaks, "I will declare the decree [or, 'I will tell of a decree']; the Load said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the nations for thine inheritance, and for thy possession the ends of the earth." Then follows an admonition to the rebels to do homage to this SON, submission to whom is submission to the Loan, and whose anger is as the LORD'S anger. Now, it is evident that the language used transcends <span class="accented">literal</span> application to any earthly king. Hence some commentators have been led to suppose that it had no even primary reference to one, being simply prophetic of the Messiah, though suggested by the circumstances of David's day. Thus Ebrard, supporting his view by the assumption (which is usually made) of the message of Nathan to David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>) being the "decree" referred to in the psalm, and the foundation of the confidence expressed in it. He argues that it was not to David, but to his posterity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>), that the position of sonship was assigned, and eternal dominion promised; and hence that David in this psalm (which he considers to have been certainly by him) must have been speaking, not in his own name, but in that of his seed after him, looking adoringly forward to the fulfillment of that glorious hope in the <span class="accented">distant future</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a>). Thus, he concludes, the insurrection of the Syrians forms merely the <span class="accented">occasion</span>, but not the <span class="accented">object</span> and <span class="accented">import</span>, of the second psalm. But, even if the message of Nathan were certainly the basis of the idea of the psalm, we find an instance of the express application of that message to David himself; as well as to his posterity, in <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>. (see vers. 20-28). It may be, however, that the reference in the psalm is to some Divine intimation, possibly to some prophecy or oracular utterance, delivered to David himself at the time of the inauguration of his own sovereignty, and long before Nathan's message. In any case, it is in accordance with the genius of prophecy, as above explained, that the words should have had a primary reference to David himself, so far forth as he imperfectly fulfilled their meaning. The main thing to be observed is that they represent an ideal of sonship and unlimited sovereignty beyond any that could, as a matter of fact, be considered as fulfilled in David. And this <span class="accented">view</span> of its meaning, suggested by the psalm itself, is confirmed by the use made of it in later Scripture. For it is evident that this psalm, together with the passage from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. (to be cited next) is made the basis of a long series of Messianic prophecies (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132.htm">Psalm 132</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-15.htm">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4.htm">Micah 4-5</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>, etc.). Its application to Christ in the New Testament is distinct and frequent (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-33.htm">Acts 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-27.htm">Revelation 2:27</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>). As to the phrase, "This day have I begotten thee," there is a difference of view among both ancient and modern expositors. The word "begotten" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) naturally suggests <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>, and is hence taken by some as referring to the eternal generation of the Son; in which case it can have had no application in any conceivable sense to the human type. "This day" has also in this case to be explained as denoting the ever-present today of eternity. So Origen, in a striking passage, "It is said to him by God, to whom it is always today. For God has no evening, nor (as I deem) any morning, but the time which is coextensive with his own unbegotten and eternal life is (if I may so speak) the day in which the Son is begotten, there being thus found no beginning of his generation, as neither is there of the day." Athanasius takes the same view; also Basil, Primasius, Thomas Aquinas, and many others. The main objection to it is the inapplicability of such a meaning of the words, even in a subordinate sense, to David or any other king of Israel. Alford, indeed, urges that this meaning agrees best with the context in the Epistle, on the ground that the eternal being of the Son, having been stated in the exordium, might be expected to be referred to in the proof. But this is hardly to the point. The writer has now begun his argument from the Old Testament, and is engaged in showing the idea involved in the term Son as applied therein to the Messiah. This, therefore, and not what he has said previously, is what we have to regard in our interpretation; and the most obvious view of the phrase, as it occurs in the psalm itself, is to regard it as a figure denoting forcibly the <span class="accented">paternity</span> of God; cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-27.htm">Jeremiah 2:27</a>, "They say to the wood, Thou art my father; to the stone, Thou hast begotten me." It <span class="accented">expresses</span> the idea that the "Son of God" spoken of derives his existence as such from him, and not from human ancestry. Chrysostom, among the ancients, understands the phrase as thus referring to the sonship assigned to the Messiah in time, and not to his eternal being. This view being taken, "this day," in reference to the king, may mean the day of the "decree," or that of his enthronement on Mount Zion. In reference to Christ it has been variously understood of the time of his incarnation, or resurrection, or ascension. If it be thought necessary to assign any definite time to it in its application to Christ, the view of its being the day of the resurrection is supported by such passages as <a href="../../par/colossians/1-18.htm">Colossians 1:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: and <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> ... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>, etc., "The promise that was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again: as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee." This last text, be it observed, is almost conclusive against the eternal generation being understood as referred to; as is also the application of the same text <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-5.htm">Hebrews 5:5</a>, where it is quoted in proof of Christ's appointment to the eternal priesthood. [" The title of <span class="accented">begetting</span> is ofttimes in sacred language to be measured, not by the scale of philosophers' or naturalists' dialect, but of moral or civil language or interpretation. For they that are sons by adoption only, or next heirs by reversion to a crown or dignity, are said to be begotten of those which adopt them, or of whom they be the immediate heirs or successors: and in this sense in the sacred genealogy (<a href="../../par/matthew/1-12.htm">Matthew 1:12</a>) Jeconiah is said to have begotten Salathiel. So that David upon his own occasions (whether upon his anointing to the crown of Judah in Hebron, or of Israel in Zion) might in the literal sense avouch these words of himself, 'I will preach the law whereof the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee.' For David to call the day of his coronation, or of his designation to the crown of Judah, or of all Israel, his <span class="accented">birthday</span>, or <span class="accented">begetting of God</span>, by whose special power and providence he was crowned, is not so harsh as some haply would deem it that either know not or consider not that it was usual in other states or kingdoms beside Judah to celebrate two <span class="accented">natales dies</span>, two solemn nativities or birthdays in honor of their kings and emperors: the one they called <span class="accented">diem natalem imperatoris</span>, the other <span class="accented">diem natalem imperii</span>; the one the birthday of the emperor when he was born of his natural mother, the other the birthday of him as he was emperor, which we call the <span class="accented">coronation day.</span> The reason might hold more peculiar in David than in any other princes, because he was the first of all the seed of Abraham that took possession of the hill of Zion, and settled the kingdom of Judah, prophesied of by his father Jacob, upon himself and his posterity Thus <span class="accented">Ego hodie genuite</span>, with submission of my opinion to better judgment, is a prediction typically prophetical, which kind of prediction, as hath been observed before, is the most concludent; and this one of the highest rank in that kind; that is, an oracle truly meant of David according to the literal sense, and yet fulfilled of Christ, the Son of God, by his resurrection from the dead, both according to the most exquisite literal and the mystical and principally intended sense" (T. Jackson's 'Works,' bk. 9. Hebrews 31:6, 7, Oxford edition, 1844, vol. 8. p. 411).] <span class="cmt_word">And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>); from Nathan's message to David, which has been spoken of above. The words do not in themselves express so unique a sonship as those used in the psalm; but, viewed in connection with the psalm, with their own context, and with subsequent prophecy, they suggest the same meaning. David had formed the design of building a temple; Nathan, by the word of the Lord, forbids his doing so, but tells him that his "seed" after him should build a house for the LORD'S Name, and that the Load would establish the throne of his kingdom for ever." Then comes the text," I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son;" followed by, "If he commit iniquity, I will chastise him with the rod of men ... but my mercy shall not depart away from him And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever." Now, there can be no doubt that there was a primary and partial fulfillment of this promise in Solomon, who built the temple after David's death. He took it to himself, so far as it was applicable to him, after his completion of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-17.htm">1 Kings 8:17</a>, etc.). But it is equally evident that its meaning could not be exhausted in him. The eternity assigned to the throne of the kingdom points to a distant as well as an immediate fulfillment, and the word translated "seed" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>), though applicable in a concrete sense to an individual offspring (cf. Gem 4:25; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>), is properly a collective noun, denoting "posterity," and thus naturally lends itself to a far-reach ng together with other passages which have been referred to in connection with the second psalm. Thus we may properly apply to this particular passage the view of the meaning of prophecy which has been set forth in general terms above, according to which we must regard Solomon, with respect to the sonship assigned to him as well as to his kingdom and the house which he was to build, as but a type and imperfect realization of a grand ideal to be in due time fulfilled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And again, when he bringeth in the first-begotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him</span>. The most obvious translation of the Greek here seems at first sight to be, "But whenever he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God] shall again bring [or, 'bring back'] the Firstborn into the inhabited world, he saith;" <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x1fc3;</span> denoting the indefiniteness of future time, and the position of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> connecting it most naturally with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>. If such be the force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, the reference must be to the second advent; which, however, is not suggested by the context, in which there has been no mention of a first advent, but only of the assignation to the Messiah of the name of Son. This supposed reference to a second advent may be avoided by disconnecting <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in sense from <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>, and taking it (as in the verse immediately preceding, and elsewhere in the Epistle) as only introducing a new quotation. And the Greek will bear this interpretation, though the order of the words, taken by themselves, is against it. The "Firstborn" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is evidently the Son previously spoken of; the word is so applied (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a>) in a passage undoubtedly founded on the text last quoted. The same word is applied in the New Testament to Christ, as "the Firstborn among many brethren," "the Firstborn of every creature," "the Firstborn from the dead" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 18</a>). And the idea conveyed by these passages may have been in the writer's mind, and intended to be understood by his Christian readers. But for the immediate purpose of his argument he may be supposed to refer only to this designation as applied in the Old Testament to the SON already spoken cf. Thus the meaning may be, "But, again, with reference to the time when he shall introduce this SON, the Firstborn, into our inhabited world, he speaks thus of the angels." Or it may be, "But whenever he shall bring a second time into the world the Firstborn who has already once appeared, he speaks thus of the angels." But the first meaning seems more suitable to the general context. The force of the writer's argument is the same, whichever view we take; the point being that, at the time of the advent of the So, whatever advent may be meant, the angels appear only as attendant worshippers. As to the understood nominative to "saith," we may suppose it to be "God," as in ver. 5. But it is to be observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, without an expressed nominative, is a usual formula for introducing a scriptural quotation. The question remains - What is the text quoted, and how can it be understood as bearing the meaning here assigned to it? In the Hebrew Bible we find nothing like it, except in <a href="../../par/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a>, "Worship him, all ye gods," A.V.; where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> we find in the LXX., though not in the Masoretic text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: the very words, including the introductory <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, which are quoted. Hence, the quotations in this Epistle being mainly from the LXX., we may conclude that this is the text referred to. It occurs towards the end of the Song of Moses, in connection with its concluding picture of the LORD'S final triumph, in which the nations are called upon to rejoice with his people, when he would avenge the blood of his servants, and render vengeance to his adversaries, and make atonement for (Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) his land and for his people. Viewed in the light of later prophecy, this triumph is identified with that of the Messiah's kingdom, and is therefore that of the time of bringing "the Firstborn into the world." cf. <a href="../../par/romans/15-10.htm">Romans 15:10</a>, where "Rejoice, ye Gentiles," etc., from the same passage, is applied to the time of Christ. It is no objection to the quotation that, as it stands in the Epistle, "the Firstborn," though not mentioned in the original, seems to be regarded as the <span class="accented">object</span> of the angels' worship. The passage is simply cited as it stands, the reader being left to draw his own inference; and the main point of it is that the angels in "that day" are not, like the Son, sharers of the throne, but only worshippers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-7.htm">Hebrews 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire</span>. A further intimation of the position assigned in the Old Testament to angels, contrasted by means of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, with further quotations with reference to the SON. A difficulty has been felt with regard to this passage (cited, as usual, from the LXX.) on the ground of the original Hebrew being supposed not to bear the meaning assigned to it. Hence the writer of the Epistle is said to have made use of an erroneous rendering for the purpose of his argument. Certainly the <span class="accented">context</span> of the psalm, in which God is represented as arraying himself in the glories and operating through the powers of nature, suggests no other meaning than that he uses the winds as his messengers, etc., in the same poetical sense in which he was said in the preceding verse to make the clouds his chariot; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>, "<span class="accented">Fire</span> and hail, snow and vapors, stormy <span class="accented">wind</span> fulfilling his word." If so, there is no necessary reference in the original psalm to angels. But it is to be observed, on the other hand, that the structure of ver. 4 is not in the Hebrew identical with that of "he maketh the clouds his chariot" in ver. 3, and hence, in itself, suggests some difference of meaning. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a different <span class="accented">verb</span> is used; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">order</span> of the accusatives following the verb is reversed; in both which respects the I,XX. correctly follows the Hebrew. In ver. 3 the verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in the LXX.), the primary meaning of which is "to set," "to place," and, when followed by two accusatives as object and predicate, denotes" to constitute or render a person or thing what the predicate expresses." In ver. 4 the verb is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX.), the primary meaning of which, when used actively, is "to form," "to fabricate." It is used of God making the heaven and the earth (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-7.htm">Genesis 1:7, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>, etc.). When elsewhere, as here, it is followed by two accusatives, one of them (which may come either first or second in order) is found to denote the material out of which anything is formed. Thus <a href="../../par/exodus/38-3.htm">Exodus 38:3</a>, "He made all the vessels (<span class="accented">of</span>) brass" (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/30-25.htm">Exodus 30:25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/36-14.htm">Exodus 36:14</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-15.htm">Exodus 37:15, 23</a>). Hence an obvious meaning of ver. 4, so far as the mere language is concerned, would be, "He maketh [or, 'formeth'] his messengers [or, 'angels'] of winds, and his ministers <span class="accented">of a</span> flaming fire." (<span class="accented">Winds</span> certainly, not <span class="accented">spirits</span>, because of the context. But here the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> is, in itself, as ambiguous as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> and was as probably meant to denote <span class="accented">winds.</span>) According to this rendering, the meaning of the verse would seem to be that, out of the natural elements of wind and fire, some special agencies are called into being or operation; not simply that winds and fire generally are used for God's purposes. The change of phraseology between vers. 3 and 4 certainly suggests some change in the idea of the psalmist. What, then, are these agencies? What is meant by the "messengers" and "ministers" connected with the elements of wind and fire? The author of the Epistle (and probably the LXX. too, though the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are, in themselves, as ambiguous as the Hebrew) saw in these words a reference to the angels, who are denoted by the same two words in <a href="../../par/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20, 21</a>, and who are undoubtedly spoken of elsewhere in the Old Testament as operating in the forces of nature (as in the death of the Egyptian firstborn, the pestilence in the time of David, and the destruction of Sennacherib's army), and seem, in some sense, to be identified with the winds themselves in <a href="../../par/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, "He rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind;" and in <a href="../../par/psalms/35-5.htm">Psalm 35:5</a>, "Let them be as chaff before the wind; and let the angel of the LORD chase them." We say that the LXX., as well as the author of the Epistle, probably intended to express this meaning. It is, indeed, more than probable; for, ambiguous as may be the words <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ffd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;</span>, the structure of the Greek sentence (in which "his angels" and "his ministers" are the objects, arid "winds" and "flames of fire" the predicates), seems to necessitate this meaning, which is further probable from what we know of Alexandrian angelology. It may thus well be that, whether or net the LXX. (rendering, as it does, the Hebrew word for word) gives the exact force of the original phrase, it hits its essential meaning, as intimating angelic agency in nature. And the learned Jews of Alexandria, followed as they are by the later rabbis generally, and by the writer of this Epistle, were, to say the least, as likely to understand the Hebrew as any modern scholars. The question, however, is not, after all, of great importance. For let us grant that the writer of the Epistle unwittingly adduced an erroneous rendering in the course of his argument. What then? It is not necessary to suppose that the inspiration of the sacred writers was such as to enlighten them in matters of Hebrew criticism. If it guarded them from erroneous teaching, it was sufficient for its purpose. And in this case the passage, as cited, at any rate expresses well the general doctrine of the Old Testament about angels, viz. that, unlike the Son, they are but subordinate agents of the Divine purposes, and connected especially with the operations of nature. It is to be observed, too, that the quotations generally in this Epistle are adduced, not as exhaustive proofs, but rather as suggestive of the general teaching of the Old Testament, with which the readers are supposed to be familiar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-8.htm">Hebrews 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">But unto the Son <i>he saith</i>, Thy throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness <i>is</i> the sceptre of thy kingdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - Two more quotations from the psalms with reference to the SON adduced in contrast. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But unto the Son</span> he saith. The preposition here translated "unto" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 7, there translated "of." As is evident from its use in ver. 7, it does not imply of necessity that the persons spoken of are <span class="accented">addressed</span> in the quotations, though it is so in this second case. The force of the preposition itself need only be "in reference to." The first quotation is from <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>. The psalm was evidently written originally as an epithalamium on the occasion of the marriage of some king of Israel to some foreign princess. The general and probable opinion is that the king was Solomon. His marriage with Pharaoh's daughter may have been the occasion. The view taken by some (as Hengstenberg), that the psalm had no original reference to an actual marriage, being purely a Messianic prophecy, is inconsistent both with its own contents and with the analogy of other Messianic psalms (see what was said on this head with reference to <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>.). Those who enter into the view of Messianic prophecy that has been given above, will have no difficulty in perceiving the justness of the application of this psalm to Christ, notwithstanding its primary import. Like <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, it presents (in parts at least) an ideal picture, suggested only and imperfectly realized by the temporary type; an ideal of which we find the germ in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, and the amplification in later prophecy. Further, the title, "For the precentor" (" To the chief musician," A.V.), shows that the psalm was used in the temple services, and thus, whatever might be the occasion of its composition, was understood by the Jews of old as having an ulterior meaning. Further, there is possibly (as Delitzsch points out) a reference to the psalm as Messianic in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-3</a>, where "the Servant of Jehovah," "the Anointed," gives the "oil of gladness" for mourning; and in Isaiah 9:5, where the words of the psalm," God" (ver. 6) and "mighty" (ver. 3) are compounded for a designation of the Messiah; also in <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-8.htm">Zechariah 12:8</a>, where it is prophesied that in the latter days" the house of David" shall be "as God." The Messianic interpretation is undoubtedly ancient. The Chaldee paraphrast (on ver. 3) writes, "Thy beauty, O King Messiah, is greater than that of the sons of men." <span class="cmt_word">Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever</span>. Attempts have been made to evade the conclusion that the king is here addressed as "God," <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by taking the clause as a parenthetic address to God himself; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by regarding" God" as appended to "throne," or as the predicate of the sentence; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> translating either "Thy throne of God is," etc. (according to the sense of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-23.htm">1 Chronicles 29:23</a>, "Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king"), or "Thy throne is God [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Divine] for ever and ever." As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, the context repudiates it. As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>, it is a question whether the Hebrew is patient of the supposed construction. At any rate, "God" is understood as a vocative in the LXX. as well as in the Epistle, in which the LXX. is quoted (for the use of the nominative form, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, in a vocative sense, cf. <a href="../../par/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>);' and in the Chaldee paraphrase, and all ancient versions, it is understood so also. Probably no other interpretation would have been thought of but for the difficulty of supposing an earthly king to be thus addressed. It is to be observed, however, that the other rendering would express essentially the same idea, and be sufficient for the argument. In either case the throne of the SON is represented as God's throne, and eternal. The only difference is that the vocative rendering makes more marked and manifest the ideal view of his subject taken by the psalmist. For it is most unlikely that a bard of the sanctuary, a worshipper of the jealous God of Israel, would have so apostrophized any earthly king except as prefiguring "a greater than Solomon" to come. It is true that kings are elsewhere called "gods" in the plural (as in <a href="../../par/psalms/82-6.htm">Psalm 82:6</a>, referred to by our Lord, <a href="../../par/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>); but the solemn addressing of an individual king by this title is (if the vocative rendering be correct) peculiar to this psalm. The passage (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-13.htm">1 Samuel 28:13</a>) adduced in abatement of the significance of the title, where the apparition of Samuel is described by the witch of Endor as "<span class="accented">Elohim</span> ascending out of the earth," is not a parallel case. The word "Elohim" has a comprehensive meaning, depending on context for its precise significance. If vocatively used in a solemn address to a king sitting upon an everlasting throne, it surely implies the assigning of Divine honors to the king so addressed. In this case still more is implied than in <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>, where the King is spoken of as God's Son, enthroned on Zion, the Son being here addressed as himself "Elohim." It may be that the inspiring Spirit suggested language to the psalmist beyond his own comprehension at the time of utterance (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10, 11</a>). It may be added that the ultimate Messianic reference of the expression is confirmed by <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the title <span class="accented">El-Gibber</span> ("<span class="accented">M</span>ighty <span class="accented">God</span>," A.V.) distinctly used of God himself in Isaiah 10:21 (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/24-8.htm">Psalm 24:8</a>), is applied to the Messiah. <span class="cmt_word">A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom</span>. In this and the following clause is expressed the important idea that the ideal throne of the SON is founded on <span class="accented">righteousness</span>, whence comes also his peculiar unction with "the oil of gladness." Only so far as Solomon or other theocratic kings exemplified the Divine righteousness, did they approach the ideal position assigned to the Son. cf. the latter part of ver. 14 in the original promise, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, and especially <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>, etc., in the "last words of David." Observe also the prominence of the idea in <a href="../../par/psalms/72.htm">Psalm 72</a>. and in later prophecy (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore, God</span>, even <span class="cmt_word">thy God</span>. The first "<span class="accented">God"</span> here may be again in the vocative, as in the preceding verse, or it may be as the A.V. takes it (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/43-4.htm">Psalm 43:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/50-7.htm">Psalm 50:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows</span>. The primary reference <span class="accented">is</span>, not to the king's coronation (as in <a href="../../par/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>), but to unction as symbolical of blessing and joy, connected with the custom of anointing the head at feasts (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-40.htm">Deuteronomy 28:40</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-17.htm">Matthew 6:17</a>). "<span class="accented">Thy</span> fellows," in its original reference, seems most naturally to mean "thy associates in royalty," "other kings;" <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/79.htm">Psalm 79</a>:27, "I will make him my Firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth." Or it might mean the companions of the bridegroom, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The latter reference lends itself readily to the fulfillment in Christ, the Bridegroom of the Church, whose <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> the redeemed are; themselves also being, after their measure, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20, 27</a>). But they are also made "kings and priests unto God" by Christ (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>); so that either of the supposed original references may be shown to be typical, if it be thought necessary to find a definite fulfillment of all the details of the address to the theocratic king. The view that in the fulfillment the angels are to be understood as Christ's <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is inadmissible. There is nothing in the psalm to suggest the thought of them, nor does the way in which they are contrasted with the SON in this chapter admit of their being here spoken of as his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. Men, in the next chapter, <span class="accented">are</span> so spoken of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, <i>even</i> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/1-10.htm">Hebrews 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning</span>, etc. The bearing of this quotation (from <a href="../../par/psalms/102-25.htm">Psalm 102:25-27</a>) on the argument in hand is not at first sight obvious; since, in the psalm, the address is plainly to God, without any mention of, or apparent reference to, the Son. The psalm is entitled, "A prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD." It seems likely, from its contents, to have been written by some suffering saint during the Babylonian captivity: for its purport is a prayer, rising into confident expectation for deliverance from a state of deep affliction, Israel being in captivity and Jerusalem in ruins. The prayed-for and expected deliverance, portrayed in vers. 16-24, corresponds so closely, both in thought and expression, with that pictured in the latter chapters of Isaiah (beginning at Hebrews 40.),that we cannot hesitate in assigning the same meaning to both. There is, for instance, the looking down of the Loan from. heaven to behold the affliction of his people (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a>); the setting free of captives (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>); the rebuilding and restoration of Zion, and in connection with this the conversion of the Gentiles to serve the Lore) with Israel (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. - 66; and especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-19.htm">Isaiah 59:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>). These are specimens of the general correspondence between the two pictures, which must be evident to all who have studied both. But the ultimate reference of Isaiah's prophecy is certainly Messianic: wherefore that of the psalm may be concluded to be the same. And thus we have made one step in explanation of the applicability of this quotation to the argument of the Epistle in confirming its ultimate reference to the Messiah's advent; to the final realization of the ideal of the Son, typified by theocratic kings. But we have still to account for the apparent application to the Son of what, in the original psalm, shows no sign of being addressed to him. One view is that there is no intention in the Epistle of quoting it as addressed to him, the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (as has been seen) not of necessity implying such intention. According to this view, the point of the quotation is that the Messianic salvation is made to rest solely on the eternity and immutability of God - of him who, as he created all at first, so, though heaven and earth should pass away, remains unchanged. And the character of the salvation, thus regarded, is conceived to carry with it the transcendent super-angelic dignity of its accomplisher, the SON. So, in effect, Ebrard, who dwells on this as one example of the general character of apostolical exegesis, as opposed to rabbinical, in that, instead of drawing inferences, often arbitrary, from isolated words or phrases, the apostolic interpreters draw all their arguments from <span class="accented">the spirit</span> of the passages <span class="accented">considered in their connection</span> and this with a depth of intuition peculiar to themselves. Other commentators consider it more consistent with both the context and the argument to see, in the Epistle at least, an intended address to the Son. If this be so, our conclusion must be that this application of the psalmist's words is the inspired writer's own; since it is certainly not apparent in the psalm. It by no means follows that the writer of the Epistle foisted, consciously or unconsciously, a false meaning into the psalm. Even apart from the consideration of his being an inspired contributor to the New Testament canon, he was too learned in Scripture, and too able a reasoner, to adduce an evidently untenable argument. He may be understood as himself applying the passage in a way which he does not mean to imply was intended by the psalmist. His drift may be, "You have seen how in <a href="../../par/psalms/45.htm">Psalm 45</a>. the Son is addressed as God, and as having an eternal throne. Yea, so Divine is he that the address to the everlasting God himself in another psalm prophetic of his advent may be truly recognized as an address to him." Whichever view we take of this difficult passage, this at any rate is evident - that the inspired writer of the Epistle, apart from the question of the relevancy of quotation in the way of argument, associated Christ in his own mind with the unchangeable Creator of all things.

The quotation is from <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, the reference of which to the Messiah is settled beyond controversy to Christian believers, not only by its being quoted or alluded to more frequently than any other psalm with that reference in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/2-34.htm">Acts 2:34</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55, 56</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3, 13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12, 13</a>), and by the introduction of its language into the Church's earliest Creeds, but also by the authority of our Lord himself, as recorded by all the three synoptical evangelists (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/12-35.htm">Mark 12:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-41.htm">Luke 20:41</a>). Hence readers of this Commentary will not require a confutation of the arguments of any modern rationalistic critics who have disputed the Messianic meaning of the psalm. Their arguments rest really on their <span class="accented">a priori</span> denial of a "spirit of prophecy" in the psalms generally; in their refusal to recognize, what the later prophets recognized, an unfulfilled ideal in what the psalmists wrote of theocratic kings. Let us once recognize this, and we shall perceive in this psalm peculiar marks of the spirit of prophecy, reaching beyond any contemporary fulfillment, not only in the assignment to the King of a seat at the right hand of the <span class="accented">heavenly</span> throne, but also in his remarkable designation as a "Priest after the order of <span class="accented">Melchizedek</span>," of which more will be said under Hebrews 5. and Hebrews 7. of this Epistle. It is to be observed also how prophets, long after the psalm was written, regarded its ideal as still awaiting fulfillment; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, etc.), whose vision of the Son of man brought near before the Ancient of days, and having an everlasting dominion given him, is referred to by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>) in connection with the psalm, as awaiting fulfillment in himself; and Zechariah (Zechariah 6:12, etc.:, who takes up the idea of the psalm in speaking of the <span class="accented">Branch</span>, who was to unite in himself royalty and priesthood. The psalm is entitled, "A psalm of David." Though this title is prefixed to some psalms the contents of which suggest a later date, and is not, therefore, considered proof of authorship, it proves at least the tradition and belief of the Jews when the Hebrew Psalter was arranged in its existing form. But we have in this case evidence in the three Gospels of its universal acceptance as a psalm of David by the Jews in the time of our Lord; and, what is of more weight, of his having himself referred to it as such. The whole point of his argument with the Pharisees depends on the acknowledgment of David being the speaker, as well as of the Messiah being the Person spoken cf. None of the Pharisees thought of disputing either of these premises; they were evidently received as indisputable; nor can it be conceived (as has been irreverently suggested) that our Lord did not thus give his own sanction to their truth. Nor, further, is there in the psalm itself any internal evidence against its Davidic authorship, though, but for the above testimony to the contrary, it <span class="accented">might</span> have been the composition of a prophet of David's day, or written by David for use by his people - the term, "my lord," having thus a primary reference to him. In either of these cases we might suppose the original conception of ver. 1 to have been that of David himself being enthroned on Zion at the side of the "King of glory" (<a href="../../par/psalms/24.htm">Psalm 24</a>.) who had "<span class="accented">come</span> in;" while ver. 4 might <span class="accented">possibly</span> have been suggested by David's organization of the services of the tabernacle, and by the personal part he took in the ritual when the ark was removed to Zion. Even so, the quotation would answer the purpose of the argument according to the view of the drift of Messianic psalms which has been explained above. But, even independently of the distinct import of our Lord's words, there are reasons (pointed out by Delitzsch) against the supposition of even a primary reference to David in the words, "my lord." Two may be mentioned: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the assignment of sacerdotal functions to an earthly king is contrary to the whole spirit of the Old Testament; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that God's own throne is elsewhere represented as, not in Zion, but above the heavens. Now, the conclusion thus arrived at, that David himself is speaking throughout the psalm of another than himself, gives a peculiar force to this final quotation, in that the Antitype is distinguished from and raised above the type more evidently than in other Messianic psalms. In others (as we have regarded them) the typical king himself is the primary object in view, though ideally glorified so as to foreshadow One greater than himself; here the typical king seems to have a distinct vision of the Messiah apart from himself, and speaks of him as his lord. It does not follow that David's own position and circumstances did not form a basis for his vision. We perceive traces of them in "the rod of thy strength out of Zion," and in the picture which follows of the submission of heathen kings after warfare and slaughter. But vers. 1 and 4 point still to another than himself whom he foresees in the spirit of prophecy. The psalm begins, literally translated, "The voice [or, 'oracle,' Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dd;</span>] of <span class="accented">Jehovah to</span> my lord, Sit thou on my right hand," etc. This sounds like more than a mere echo of Nathan's message, the language being different and still more significant. And that such a vision of a future fulfillment of the promise was not foreign to the mind of David appears from his "last words" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-1.htm">2 Samuel 23:1</a>, etc.), where also the significant word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5e1;</span> is used. And now, mark what the language of this "oracle" implies - not merely the enthronement of the Son on Zion as God's Vicegerent, but his session at the right hand of God himself, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "<span class="accented">at</span> the right hand of the Majesty on high;" God's own throne being ever (as has been said above) regarded as above the heavens, or, if on earth, above the cherubim. Such, then, being the meaning of the "<span class="accented">oracle"</span> (and it is the meaning uniformly given it in the New Testament), well may it be adduced as the final and crowning proof of the position above the angels assigned to the SON in prophecy.

Here the writer ranks himself among those who had not heard Christ himself; his doing which has been considered to afford a presumption against St. Paul having been the writer. For, though not an eyewitness of Christ's ministry, he is in the habit elsewhere of insisting strongly on his having received his "knowledge of the mystery," not from men or through men, but by direct revelation from the ascended Savior (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1, 12</a>). Still, he does not deny elsewhere that for the <span class="accented">facts</span> of Christ's history he was indebted to the testimony of others (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, etc.). It was rather the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the mystery that he had learnt from heaven.

The idea is that the hearers of "the Lord" testified, and God attested their testimony by the signs that accompanied their ministry. The passage is instructive as expressing the grounds of <span class="accented">acceptance</span> of the gospel. Its truth was already "confirmed" to believers by the testimony of unimpeachable witnesses to that which, so attested, carried with it its own evidence. But the signs attending the apostolic ministry were granted for further attestation. Thus "signs and wonders," the craving for which as a condition of belief was so condemned by our Lord, have their true evidential value assigned them. They did not furnish the original basis of belief, which rested on Christ himself, his Person. and his work, as unimpeachably attested. They came in only as suitable accompaniments of a Divine dispensation, and as additional confirmations. The apologists of the last generation were given to rest the evidence of Christianity too exclusively on miracles. The tendency of the present age is to dwell rather on its internal evidence, and, so far as it can be done, to explain away the miracles. They are not to be explained away, having been, as has been said, fitting accompaniments and confirmations of such a dispensation as the gospel was. But to us, as well as to those early believers, they are not the first or main ground of our belief. To us, as re them, Christ and his gospel, testified to as they are by" them that heard," are their own sufficient evidence. Indeed, the cogency of the "signs" in the way of evidence is less now than formerly, since they too have now passed into the category of things that rest on testimony. The evidential counterpart to them in our case is the continued attestation which God gives to the gospel in its living power on the souls of men, and its results in the world before our eyes. It is thus that our faith is strengthened in "the salvation at first spoken through the Lord, and confirmed to us by them that heard." Four expressions are used for the miraculous accompaniments of the first preaching of the gospel, denoting, apparently, not so much different classes of miracles, as different ways of regarding them.

The phrase, with that which follows, according to his own will, is peculiarly Pauline, and confirms the conclusion that the writer, though not necessarily St. Paul himself, was at any rate one of the circle influenced by his teaching.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> does not in itself necessarily imply futurity from the writer's standpoint though, according to what was said above, the complete fulfilment of the prophetic anticipation is to be looked for in the second advent, whatever earnest and foretaste of it there may be already under the gospel dispensation. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">sub</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) is the same as was used (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>) in reference to the Son's advent, denoting the sphere of created things over which he should reign. And it is suitably used here with a view to the coming quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>, in which the primary idea is man's supremacy over the inhabited globe. The whole phrase may be taken to express the same idea as the "new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But one in a certain place</span> (or, <span class="accented">somewhere</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>testified, saying</span>. The phrase does not imply uncertainty as to the passage cited. It is one used by Philo when exact reference is not necessary. It is equivalent to "but we do find the following testimony with regard to <span class="accented">man</span>." We say <span class="accented">to man</span>; for the eighth psalm, from which the citation comes, evidently refers to man generally; not primarily or distinctively to the Messiah. Nor does it appear to have been ranked by the Jews among the Messianic psalms. It would be arbitrary interpretation to assign to it (as some have done) an original meaning of which it contains no signs. This being the case, how are we to explain its application to Christ, which is not confined to this passage, but is found also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>? There is no real difficulty. True, the psalm speaks of man only; but it is of man regarded according to the ideal position assigned to him in <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, as God's vicegerent. Man as he now is (says the writer of this Epistle) does not fulfill this ideal; but Christ, the Son of man, and the Exalter of humanity, does. Therefore in him we find the complete fulfillment of the meaning of the psalm. If it be still objected that the application (in which sovereignty over all created things is inferred) transcends the meaning of the psalm, which refers to this earth only - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 6. of the psalm being taken in a wider sense than seems justified by the following verses, which confine the application to earthly creatures, it may be replied <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the idea of the psalmist is to be gathered, not only from <a href="../../par/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, which he quotes, but, further, from the whole purport of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, of which the psalm is a lyrical expression, including the conception of man having been made in God's image, and invested with a sovereignty little short of Divine; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that, if the application does transcend the scope of the psalm, it was open to an inspired writer of the New Testament thus to extend its meaning, as seen in the new light from Christ. Taking the latter view, we have but to put the argument thus, in order to see its force and legitimacy: In <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>. (read in connection with <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, on which it is founded) a position is assigned to man which at present he does not realize; but its whole idea is fulfilled, <span class="accented">and more than fulfilled</span>, in Christ. It is to be observed that the original reference of the psalm to man generally is not only evident in itself, but also essential to the writer's argument. For he is now passing from the view set forth in <a href="../../par/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1</a>, of what the SON is in himself, to the further view of his participation in humanity, in order to exalt humanity to the position forfeited through sin; and thus (as has been shown in the foregoing summary) to lead up to the idea of his being our <span class="accented">great High Priest. <span class="cmt_word"></span>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</span> In the psalm this exclamation comes after a contemplation of the starry heavens, which had impressed the psalmist's mind with a sense of God's transcendent glory. In contrast with this glory, man's insignificance and unworthiness occur to him, as they have similarly occurred to many; but, at the same time, he thought of the high position assigned to man in the account of the creation, on which position he next enlarges. He asks how it can be that man, being what he is now, can be of such high estate. Thus the Epistle carries out truly the idea of the psalm, which is that man's appointed position in the scale of things is beyond what he seems now to realize. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-7.htm">Hebrews 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels</span>. Here the LXX. takes <span class="accented">Elohim</span> (being a plural form) to mean "angels;" as also in <a href="../../par/psalms/97-7.htm">Psalm 97:7</a> and Psalms 138:1. The more correct rendering of the Hebrew may be, "thou reddest him a little short of God," with reference to his having been made "in God's image," "after God's likeness," and having dominion over creation given him. But, if so, <span class="accented">Elohim</span> must be understood in its abstract sense of "Divinity" (so Genesis), rather than as denoting the Supreme Being. Otherwise, "thyself" would have been the more appropriate expression, the psalm being addressed to God. The argument is not affected by the difference of translation. Indeed, the latter rendering enhances still more the position assigned to man. <span class="cmt_word">Thou crownedst him with glory and worship, and didst set him over the works of thy hands</span>. The latter clause of this sentence, which is found in the LXX., but not in the Hebrew, is omitted in several codices. It is not wanted for the purpose of the argument. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <i>that is</i> not put under him.

For in that he put all things in subjection under him</span>, etc. Here the argument from the psalm begins. It is to the following effect: <span class="accented">For</span> the subjection of <span class="accented">all things</span>, in the Creator's design, to man leaves nothing exempted from his sovereignty. <span class="accented">But</span> we do not see man, as he is upon earth now, occupying this implied position of complete sovereignty. <span class="accented">Therefore</span> the full idea of the psalm awaits fulfillment. And we Christians find its complete fulfillment in him who, having become a man like us, and is made with us "a little lower than the angels," is now, as man, and for man, "crowned with glory and honor," at the right hand of the Majesty on high. Or we may put it thus: In the present <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> man is not supreme over "all things" in the sense denoted; but in the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> to come "of which we speak," with its far wider bearings, he is, in the Person of Christ, over "all things" thus supreme. Therefore in Christ alone does man attain his appointed destiny. We may here observe how, even without the enlightenment of Scripture, man's own consciousness reveals to him an ideal of his position in creation which, in his present state, he does not realize. The strange apparent contradiction between man as he is and man as he feels he should be, between experience and conscience, between the facts and the ideal of humanity, has long been patent to philosophers as well as divines.

The Greek in itself will bear either meaning; and if "a little" be, as it seems to be, the original meaning in the psalm, there is no necessity for supposing a departure from it. All that the writer need be supposed to intimate is that Christ, through his incarnation, took man's position as represented in the psalm. <span class="cmt_word">For the suffering of death</span>.

But the proper force of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with the accusative is better preserved, and a better meaning given to the passage, by connecting <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> with the clause that follows, and translating, <span class="cmt_word">But we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor</span>. His crowning was the consequence of his suffering; because of his suffering he was crowned; he won, as man, and in virtue of his human obedience unto death, his position of "glory and honor." Exactly the same idea is found in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>, etc., where the purpose and result of Christ's suffering, here anticipated, are more explicitly set forth (cf. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). This view, too, suits the drift of the passage before us, which is that human nature has been exalted in the Person of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">That he, by the grace of God, should taste death for every man</span>. Two questions arise here: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> As to the meaning of the expression, "that he should taste death," etc.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to the true reading, as well as the meaning, of the phrase translated "by the grace of God." As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span>, the clause is introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, followed by the subjunctive, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: and the construction of the sentence evidently connects it, not with <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> It is, "Because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, in order that for [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in behalf of] all he may taste of death." Now, the fact that the actual death was previous to the crowning suggests reference, not so much to it as to its permanent efficacy: and, further, the emphatic words are <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, as shown by their position in the sentence; and thus the idea seems to be, "In order that <span class="accented">for all</span> his tasting of death may be availing." And he may even be regarded as still tasting of death after his crowning, in the sense of knowing its taste through his human experience, and so perfectly sympathizing with mortal man (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>:15, and below in this chapter, vers. 14, 15). It is a further question whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> should be here taken as masculine, as in the A.V., or, like the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, as neuter, in the sense of "all creation." The latter rendering seems in itself more natural, though" all mankind" must be conceived as the main idea in the writer's view. At the same time, it is to be remembered how the redemption is elsewhere spoken of as availing for creation generally, for the restitution of universal harmony (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10, 20</a>, etc.). A further reason for understanding <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the wider sense will appear in our examination of the phrase next to be considered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As to the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is found in all existing manuscripts except in one uncial of the tenth century (Codex Uffenbach, cited as M), in a scholium to Codex 67, and in a codex of the Peschito. But, on the other hand, Origen, an earlier authority than any manuscript, speaks of the prevalent reading in his time being <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> being found only in some copies (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). Theodoret, Theodorus of Mopsuestia, and the Nestorians also read <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>: and the Latin Fathers, Ambrose, Fulgentius, and others, have <span class="accented">absque</span> as its equivalent. Jerome also speaks of the reading <span class="accented">absque</span>, but as occurring only "in quibusdam exemplaribus" - thus reversing in his day what Origen had said two centuries earlier as to the comparative prevalence of the two readings. The charge made by Marius Mercator, Theophylact, and OEcumenius against the Nestorians, that they had introduced the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> in support of their own views, is evidently untenable, since the testimony of Origen proves its prevalence long before the Nestorian controversy. It is, on the other hand, very probable that the use made of this reading by the Nestorians was a cause of the other being clung to by the orthodox, and being retained almost exclusively in the existing codices. And this probability greatly weakens the force of the evidence of the manuscripts as to the original reading. That both were very early ones is evident; but that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> was the original one is probable for two reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Origen testifies to its prevalence in his early day, and accepts it as at least equally probable with the other; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that transcribers were more likely to change the unusual and somewhat difficult <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span> into the familiar and easy <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> than <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> Theodorus of Mopsuestia thus accounts for the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which he rejects very decidedly. He says that some persons, not observing the sequence of the passage, had laughably changed the true reading, because they did not understand it, into one that seemed easy to them. If <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> be the true reading, the meaning is plain enough; it expresses the view, often reiterated by St. Paul, of the whole work of redemption being "of grace." The objection to it, on internal grounds, is that the introduction of this view here seems flat and purposeless, as Theodorus of Mopsuestia forcibly contends in his argument against the reading. <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>, then, being adopted, the question remains whether to connect <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (as Theodorus of Mopsuestia does, and as the Nestorians must have done) with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. If taken with the former, its purpose must be to exclude the Godhead in Christ from participation in the taste of death. Some further explain by reference to the cry from the cross, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" But such reference does not suit the view above taken of the intended meaning o <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Taken with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (as is rather suggested by the arrangement of the sentence, in which this is the emphatic phrase), it gives the meaning, "that for all except God he may taste of death" - this parenthetical exception of the Divine Being himself being similar to that which St. Paul sees reason for inserting in his application of the same psalm to Christ: <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>).

The latter Father explains the wide sense in which it follows that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> must be understood by referring to what St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>) of creation itself being delivered from the bondage of corruption through Christ, and to the rejoicing of angels in the salvation of man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">For it became him, for whom <i>are</i> all things, and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it became him, for whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>, with accusative) <span class="cmt_word">are all things, and through whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with genitive) <span class="cmt_word">are all things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> God), <span class="cmt_word">in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> This refers to what was said in the preceding verse, of Christ having been crowned with glory on account of his suffering of death, and of his tasting death for all. That he should attain through human suffering even unto death to his own perfected state of glory, as being the Leader of human sons whom the one Father of all would bring to glory, was a design worthy of him for whom and through whom are all things - suitable to what we conceive of him and of his way of working. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span> is used in the same sense not infrequently in the LXX. It is probably used here with some view to "<span class="accented">the</span> offence of the cross," which might still linger in the minds of some of the Hebrew Christians. In the argument that follows, supported still by reference to Old Testament anticipations, the writer not only meets possible objections lingering in the Hebrew mind, but also carries on and completes the view of the SON which it is his purpose to inculcate, leading up (as aforesaid) to the final position of his being the High Priest of humanity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <i>are</i> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For both he that sanctifieth</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and they that are sanctified</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "many sons" who are brought unto glory) <span class="cmt_word">are all of one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of God). The idea expressed here by the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, to sanctify, may be determined by comparison with <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14, 29</a>; and Hebrews 13:12 (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="../../par/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>. It is not the idea, to us most familiar, of moral sanctification through the Holy Spirit, but that of the redeemed being brought into a new relation to God, hallowed for "<span class="accented">glory</span>," through redemption; whence all Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f09;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the equivalent in the LXX. of the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>, which is applied to the hallowing of both the sacrifices and the people to God's service. As an atoning sacrifice, Christ thus hallowed himself (<a href="../../par/john/17-19.htm">John 17:19</a>), that thus he might hallow the "many sons." <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> must certainly be taken as referring to God, not (as some take it) to Abraham or Adam. For the necessity of the SON taking part of <span class="accented">flesh and blood</span> in order to accomplish the redemption is not introduced till ver. 14. So far the common fatherhood spoken of has been that of him "for whom are all things and by whom are all things," who, "in bringing many <span class="accented">sons</span> to glory," has perfected "the Captain of their salvation." The idea is that it was meet that the Captain should be perfected through human sufferings, <span class="accented">since</span> both he and the "many sons" are of one Divine Father; in their relation of sonship (with whatever difference of manner and degree) they are associated together. Be it observed, however, that it is not the <span class="accented">original</span> relation to God of the "Sanctifier" and the "sanctified," but their relation to him in the redemption, that is denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The common sonship does not consist in this, that <span class="accented">he</span> is Son by eternal generation and <span class="accented">they</span> by creation. It has been seen above that the term <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f35;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is net applied to Christ in this Epistle with reference to his eternal Being, but to his incarnation; and the human "sons" are not regarded as such till made so by redemption. <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> rule the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The view is that the one Father sent the SON into the world to be the Firstborn of many sons. The expression, frequent in the Pentateuch, "I am he that sanctifieth," may be cited in illustration of the moaning of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">For which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the Messianic utterances of the Old Testament, to which, in accordance with the plan and purpose of the Epistle, reference is again made for proof. The point of the quotations that follow (vers. 12, 13) is that the Messiah, notwithstanding the position above the angels, shown above to be assigned to him, is represented also as associating himself with men as brethren, in dependence on one heavenly Father. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-12.htm">Hebrews 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will declare thy Name unto my brethren, in the midst of the Church</span> (or, <span class="accented">congregation</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>will I sing praise unto thee</span>. This first citation is from <a href="../../par/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>, quoted, it would seem, from memory or from a text of the LXX. different from ours, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> being changed to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;</span>, but with no difference of meaning. The psalm is attributed by tradition to David, being entitled "a psalm of David." Delitzsch and Ebrard accept it as certainly his, concluding, from its position in the first book of the psalms (1-72.), that it was included in the collection made by David himself (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18</a> with <a href="../../par/psalms/72-20.htm">Psalm 72:20</a>). Others, as recently Perowne, think that the fact of the suffering and humiliation described, being beyond any experienced by David himself, points to some other unknown author. The conclusion, however, does not necessarily follow. David, writing "<span class="accented">in</span> Spirit," when under persecution by Saul, may be conceived as drawing a picture, with regard both to present humiliation and to expected triumph, beyond the facts of his own case, taking his own experience as typical of a higher fulfillment. And the minute details of the suffering described, answering so remarkably to the circumstances of the Crucifixion, certainly suggest the idea of a distinct prophetic vision. Still, there is no reason for concluding that the psalm was not, like other Messianic psalms, suggested by and founded on the writer's own circumstances and experience. Detitzsch says well, "The way of sorrows by which David mounted to his earthly throne was a type of that <span class="accented">Via Dolorosa</span> by which Jesus, <span class="accented">the Son of David</span>, passed before ascending to the right hand of the Father." There is no psalm of which the ultimate Messianic reference is to Christian believers more undoubted. The first words of it were uttered by Jesus himself from the cross (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>); and for its fulfillment in him, recognized by the evangelists, see <a href="../../par/matthew/27-39.htm">Matthew 27:39, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23, 28</a>. The general purport of the psalm is as follows: A persecuted sufferer, under a feeling of being forsaken by God, pours out his complaint, and prays for succor; suddenly, at the end of ver. 21, the tone of the psalm changes into one of confident anticipation of deliverance and triumph, when the psalmist shall praise the Lord in the congregation of his brethren, when all that fear the Lord shall join him in praise, when the "ends of the earth" shall turn to the Lord, and "all the families of the nations" shall worship with Israel. The close agreement of the latter part of the psalm with the Messianic anticipations of prophecy is obvious, and would in itself determine its Messianic import. The marked difference between this psalm and those previously quoted is that the typical psalmist appears here as a human sufferer previously to his triumph, thus anticipating the similar view of the Messiah in prophecy, as notably in Isaiah lilt. And hence this psalm is suitably quoted here as a striking and early anticipation of a Messiah "perfected through sufferings," and associated in sympathy with human "brethren," the verse actually quoted, in which "<span class="accented">he</span> is not ashamed to call them <span class="accented">brethren</span>," being sufficient to remind the readers of the whole of this aspect of Messianic prophecy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And again, I will put my trust in him</span>. There are two passages of the Old Testament from which this may be a citation <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>. In either case the original is slightly altered in the citation, probably with a purpose; the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> being prefixed, and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> being (suitably after this addition) placed before instead of after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span>. The purpose of this change may be to bring into prominence the thought that the Messiah himself, in his humanity, puts his trust in God as well as the "<span class="accented">brethren"</span> with whom he associates himself. The passage in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a> is from the psalm of David, written "<span class="accented">in</span> the day when the Loan had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul." It is given also in the Book of Psalms as <a href="../../par/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, where the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>: so that, if the quotation is from the psalm, it is taken from the historical book. But is the quotation from the psalm or from Isaiah? If from the former, it serves (if <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. is also David's) to complete the type of the same royal sufferer, showing him reliant on God along with his brethren in the day of success, as well as during previous trial. Most commentators, however, suppose the quotation to be from Isaiah, inasmuch as the following one is from him, not only coming immediately after the first in the original, but also dependent on it for its meaning. Nor is the introduction of the second quotation by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> conclusive against its being the continuation of the same original passage, since it introduces a new idea, to which attention may be thus drawn. Possibly the writer, familiar as he was with the Old Testament, had both passages in his view, the phrase common to both serving as a connecting link between David and Isaiah. <span class="cmt_word">And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me</span>. The applicability of the whole passage in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17, 18</a>) to the writer's argument is not at first sight obvious. It occurs in connection with the memorable message to Ahaz, on the occasion of the confederacy of Rezin and Pekah against Judah, in the course of which the prophet foretells (Isaiah 7:14) the birth of Immanuel. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8</a>. and Hebrews 9. he expands this message, rising into a vein of undoubted Messianic prophecy (see especially <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-8</a>). In the midst of general dismay and disbelief the prophet stands firm and undaunted, presenting himself as a sign as well as a messenger of the salvation which he foretells: "Behold, I and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for <span class="accented">signs</span> and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of hosts." The "children" thus associated with himself as signs appear to have been his two sons, with their symbolical names, Shear-jashub and Maher-shalal-hash-baz, the first of whom he had been commanded to take with him (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-3.htm">Isaiah 7:3</a>) on his first visit to Ahaz, and the second of whom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-3.htm">Isaiah 8:3</a>) had been borne to him by the "prophetess," and named under a Divine command. His own name also may be regarded in the "sign" as symbolical, meaning "Jehovah's salvation." If then, the words of vers. 17, 18 are quoted as those of the prophet himself (and they are certainly his own in our Hebrew text), he is viewed as himself a sign, in the sense of type, of the Immanuel to come. And the point of the quotation is that, to complete such typical sign, it was required that "the children God had given him" should be combined with him in the representation. They represent the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as Isaiah does the <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, all being together <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. If it be objected that the children given to Isaiah were his own offspring, and not "brethren," as in the antitype, it may be replied that it is net the human paternity of the "children," but their having been given by God to the prophet to be "signs" along with him, that is the prominent; idea in the original passage, and that, thus viewed, the words of Isaiah have their close counterpart in those of our Lord; "The men which thou gavest me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gavest them me" (<a href="../../par/john/17-6.htm">John 17:6, 9, 11, 12</a>). Such, then, may be the ground for assigning the utterance to Christ, justified by the Messianic character of Old Testament prophecy in general, according to which "the historic sense of the utterance does not exclude the purpose of prophecy; but leaves typical references open which declare themselves historically by some corresponding Messianic fact, and hence are recognized afterwards from the point of view of historic fulfillment" (Meyer). But when we refer to the LXX. (which in the passage before us varies greatly from the Hebrew) we find a further reason. The LXX. has (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-16.htm">Isaiah 8:16, 17, 18</a>) "Then shall be manifest these that seal the Law that one should not learn it. And <span class="accented">he</span> will say (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>), I will wait upon God, who has turned away his hoe from the house of Israel, and I will put my trust in him. Lo I and the children which God hath given me." Here, in the absence of any preceding nominative in the singular to be the subject of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, the writer of the Epistle may have understood the Messiah to be the speaker; and the Seventy also may have so intended the expression. The general drift of the passage, as interpreted in the Epistle, remains the same, though the LXX. more distinctly suggests and justifies its application to Christ. The only difference is that, according to the Hebrew, the prophet speaks and is regarded as a type; according to the LXX., the Antitype himself is introduced as speaking, and declaring the type of Isaiah to be fulfilled in himself.

Here the purpose of the Incarnation is set forth as requiring the complete association of the SON with human brethren to which prophecy had pointed. But more is now declared than the prophecies so far quoted have implied; and thus is introduced (by way of anticipation, as is usual in the Epistle) the doctrine of atonement, which is to be dwelt on afterwards. For the object of Christ's becoming one of us is now further said to be that by <span class="accented">dying</span> he might effect <span class="accented">redemption.</span> The "children" in ver. 14 are the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of the type in Isaiah, fulfilled in the "many sons" to be "sanctified" and brought to glory. (We may observe, by the way, the difference between the words used of their participation in human nature and of Christ's - <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>: the aorist in the latter case expresses his sharing what was not his before, and so distinctly implies his pre-existence.) For understanding' the account here given of the purpose of the Incarnation, we must remember that <span class="accented">death</span>, originally announced (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>) as the penalty of transgression, is regarded in the New Testament (notably by St. Paul) as the sign of the continual dominion of sin over the human race. Thus in <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12, 15</a> the mere fact that all men "from Adam to Moses" had died is adduced as sufficient proof that all were under condemnation as sinners. Whatever further idea is implied in the word "death " - such as alienation from God in whom is life eternal, or any "blackness of darkness" thereupon ensuing in the world beyond the grave - of man's subjection or liability to all this his natural death is regarded as the sign. It is to be remembered, too, that "the devil," through whom it was that sin first entered, and death through sin, is revealed to us generally as the representative of evil (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), and, as such, the primeval manslayer (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), with power given him over death, the penalty of sin, as long as man remains in his dominion, unredeemed. Till redemption cast a new light upon the gloom of death, man was all his life long in fear of it; its shadow was upon him from his birth; it loomed ever before him as a passing into darkness, unrelieved by hope. We know well how the hopeless dismalness of death was a commonplace with the classical poets, and how, even now, the natural man shrinks from it as the last great evil. But Christ, human, yet sinless, died for all mankind, and, so dying, wrested from the devil his power over death, and emancipated believers from their state of "bondage" (as to which, see below). On particular expressions in this passage we may remark: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That, "having the power of death," which has been variously interpreted, may be taken in the usual sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz. "having power, or dominion, <span class="accented">over."</span> Satan has had the dominion over death allowed him because of human sin. And it may be observed that elsewhere, not only death, but other woes that flesh is heir to - its precursors and harbingers - are attributed to Satanic agency (cf. <a href="../../par/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/2-6.htm">John 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-16.htm">Luke 13:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Christ is not here said to have as yet abolished death itself; only to have rendered impotent him that had the power of it; for natural death still "reigns," though to believers it has no "sting." In the end (according to <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/20-14.htm">Revelation 20:14</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>) death itself will be destroyed. In one passage, indeed, it is spoken of by St. Paul as already abolished (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-10.htm">2 Timothy 1:10</a>); but this is in the way of anticipation: death is already vanquished and disarmed to believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The bondage (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) spoken of is the condition of unredeemed man, often so designated by St. Paul. See <a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8, where man's bondage (felt when conscience is awake) to "the law of sin in the members," and his emancipation from it through faith, are described; and especially Romans 8:15, 16, 17 ("For ye have not received the spirit of <span class="accented">bondage</span> again to <span class="accented">fear</span>," etc.), as elucidating <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span>The word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, followed this passage by the genitive (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), expresses here more than "<span class="accented">liability</span> to;" it implies present implication, equivalent to "in hold to."

The expression, "the seed of Abraham," is, of course, not intended to exclude the Gentiles: it is appropriately used in reference to the Messianic promises of the Old Testament (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/23-18.htm">Genesis 23:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>): and the extension of its meaning to "all them that believe" would be as familiar to the first readers of the Epistle as to us (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/john/8-39.htm">John 8:39</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11, 16</a>). The conclusion of ver. 17 (which repeats virtually what has been alleged before, after reason given) now naturally follows: <span class="cmt_word">Whence it behooved him in all things to be assimilated to his brethren</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the race which was the object of his redemptive succor.

It was that he might be fully constituted as the High Priest of humanity. Here, according to the manner of the Epistle, the view of priesthood, to be afterwards set forth at length, is briefly hinted. It is taken up in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, after the conclusion that Christ is man's High Priest has been reached by another line of argument (see preceding summary).

Reference to what has gone before is perceptible throughout this verse. The persons addressed are "holy," as being among the "sanctified" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>); "brethren," as being, with the writer, in this relation to Christ (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11, 12, 13, 17</a>); their calling is a heavenly one, being from heaven (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>) and to heaven (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>). Jesus is their" Apostle," as having been sent into the world, as above set forth, from God; their "High Priest," as implied, though not distinctly expressed, at the end of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, which led up to the idea. "Jesus" is added at the end in apposition, so as to fix attention on him, as the bearer of these titles, who was known by that name in the flesh. On the title "Apostle," we may observe that, though it is nowhere else in the New Testament applied to Christ, yet its idea with respect to him is frequent both in this Epistle and elsewhere (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-48.htm">Luke 9:48</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3, 18</a>, etc.). The word <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "confession;" in the A.V., "profession") is generally used for the Christian's avowal of his faith before men (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>). The genitive here depends on both the preceding substantives, its force probably being that Jesus, as Apostle and High Priest, is the <span class="accented">object</span> of our confession of faith. On Jesus, then, being such, the readers are called to fix earnestly their mental gaze, and in doing so take further note of his superiority to Moses, which is the subject of what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses <i>was faithful</i> in all his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who was faithful</span> (or, <span class="accented">as being faithful</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>to him that appointed</span> (literally, <span class="accented">made</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>him, as also Moses was in all his house</span>. The reference is to what was said of Moses (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>), "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house," and serves aptly to introduce the intended comparison of Christ with him. In respect of faithfulness to him who constituted him in his office, Christ resembles Moses; in respect to his office itself, it is to be shown that he is far above him. Observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "his house" means <span class="accented">God's</span> house, as' is plain from the text cited, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house of him who appointed him; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that "in all his house" has reference to Moses only, not to Christ; for the main point of what follows is that Christ is <span class="accented">over</span> God's house, not in it, as Moses was. As to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (translated in A.V. "appointed "), it may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>, where the LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Hebrew verb being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span>, which seems to mean in this case "constitute," not "create" (so Gesenius). The preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span>, though it is not necessary to supply them as understood, may be taken here to rule the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. for a similar use of the verb without a second accusative following, <a href="../../par/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus the Arian inference from the word, that Christ is represented as a creature, is groundless. Nor need reference be supposed to his human birth or conception, the <span class="accented">temporalis generatio</span> of the man Jesus (Athanasius, Ambrose, and other Fathers). Certainly not to his eternal generation (as Bleek and Lunemann); such reference is foreign to the idea of the passage; nor could the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> with any propriety be so used.

This, rather than "the glory he had with the Father before the world was" (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), is suggested by the word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as well as by the drift of the preceding chapters. We may suppose also a reference, in contrast, to the transitory "glory" on the countenance of Moses (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which is contrasted (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.) with the <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in Christ. We observe, further, that in the latter part of the verse <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, as more suitable to the mundane comparison of a house and its builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of fitting up and furnishing a house as well as building it. But what is the drift of the intended argument? It is usual, with the Fathers generally, to suppose that Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is intended to be denoted as the Builder or Establisher of the house in which Hoses was a servant, and that the argument is that he, as such, is necessarily greater than the servant, who was but a part of the house, or household, thus established. <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, it is to be observed, may include in its meaning the <span class="accented">familia</span>, as well as the house itself, as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> may include the idea of constituting the whole establishment (cf. <span class="accented">infra</span>, "whose house we are"). Among moderns, Hofmann and Delitzsch deny this identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: against which there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The SON has not been represented so far in the Epistle as the <span class="accented">originator</span> of the economy of redemption. Notwithstanding distinct intimations of his eternal proexistent Deity (as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2, 10</a>), it has been as the Messiah, the Apostle and High Priest, manifested in time, and passing through humanity to glory, that he has been regarded in the preceding argument. Nor is there any proof here adduced of his being the <span class="accented">Builder</span> of the "house," so as to justify the conclusion on this ground of his glory being greater than that of Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("has been counted worthy of") suggests (as has been already remarked) refer once to the glory won by him, "on account of the suffering of death," rather than to his pristine glory as the Divine Builder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Elsewhere in the New Testament, when the Church is referred to under the figure of a house, it is spoken of as <span class="accented">God's</span> building (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-21.htm">Hebrews 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-22.htm">Ephesians 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). It is never spoken of as Christ's. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording of ver. 3 does not necessitate the identification of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means "so far as;" it implies only that the glory of Christ is greater than that of Moses, <span class="accented">in proportion as</span> the honor of the builder is greater than that of the house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The identification increases the difficulty of understanding the relevance to the argument of ver. 4, of which more will be said presently. Taking, then, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to denote God the Father, we may state the argument thus: God is the Builder, or Founder, of his own house. Christ has been already shown to be his SON, associated with him in dignity and power, and, as such, Lord over his Father's house. Moses, on the other hand, as appears from <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, was but a servant in God's house. As, then, the Founder is to the house, so is the Son and Lord to a servant in it; the Son partaking of the glory of the Founder; the servant only of that of the house in which he serves. According to this view of the argument, the premises have been established, and the conclusion follows; the relation of Christ to the Builder of the house has been set forth in the preceding chapter, and may be now assumed; that of Moses is sufficiently shown by the quotation from the Pentateuch. Thus also vers. 5 and 6 are found to carry out naturally the idea here introduced, instead of unexpectedly starting a different one. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/3-4.htm">Hebrews 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">For every house is builded by some <i>man</i>; but he that built all things <i>is</i> God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For every house is builded</span> (or, <span class="accented">established</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by some one; but he that built</span> (or, <span class="accented">established</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things is God</span>. Of the second clause of this verse "God" is rightly taken by modern commentators as the subject, not the predicate, though the Fathers generally take it otherwise. Thus Theodoret, regarding  as a <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> designation of Christ, views this clause as an assertion of his Deity on the ground of his being the Founder of all things. But this view introduces an idea out of keeping with the argument, and especially with the preceding expression, "faithful to him who appointed him," in which Christ, in his office as the Christ, is distinguished from the Creator of all who appointed him to that office. The verse seems to be interposed in elucidation of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, to make it clear that the Founder of the house spoken of is God himself, and thus to give full effect to the proportionate glory of Christ in comparison with that of Moses. Thus: the glory of Christ is greater than that of Moses by so much as the honor of the founder of a house is greater than that of the house; - of the founder, we say; for every house has some founder: but God is the original Founder of all things, and therefore of necessity the Founder of this house of his own in which Moses was a servant. The verse, thus interpreted, seems (as intimated there) to fall in with the train of thought mere naturally than it can be shown to do if Christ is 'regarded as the Builder. <span class="accented">Possibly</span> "all things" may be purposely used to denote the house itself over which Christ, as Son, is Lord. For, though the expression seems too wide for the limited house in which Moses was a servant, it is net so for the expanded and consummated house over which Christ in glory reigns; cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Whom he appointed Heir of <span class="accented">all things</span>;" and <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>, "Thou hast put <span class="accented">all things in</span> subjection under his feet;" the last being said in especial connection with the "glory and honor" wherewith Christ "has been counted worthy" to be crowned. It is not necessary to confine the meaning of "God's house" to the Mosaic dispensation, or to assign to it (as some have done) two separate meanings in the cases of Moses and of Christ. It may be regarded as a comprehensive term, including in its general meaning the Law, the gospel, and the final consummation the whole dispensation of redemption, beginning with the Law, and completed at the second advent. Moses held office in its early stage, and there only as a servant; in its ultimate <span class="accented">development</span> it comprises "all things," and over "all things," thus comprised, Christ, as SON, has been shown to be by inheritance absolute Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses verily <i>was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterwards to be spoken; but Christ, as Son over his house</span>. We have already anticipated the explanation of this passage, which, according to the view taken above, is a setting forth of the distinction between Christ and Moses intended from the first; that of one being "Son over," the other but "servant <span class="accented">in</span>," the house of God. The rendering of the A.V., "his own house," in ver. 6, where Christ is spoken of, is not justifiable. It is true that we have no means of knowing whether <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> was intended, and that even <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> might, according to the usage of Hellenistic Greek, refer to Christ; but if the writer had so intended it, he might easily have avoided ambiguity by writing <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, etc. He has not done so; and, therefore, it is most natural to take "<span class="accented">his</span> house" in the same sense throughout the passage; viz. as" <span class="accented">God's</span> house," referred to in <a href="../../par/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>, whence the expression is taken. We observe further that "the things that were afterwards to be spoken (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" must be taken as denoting the future "speaking" of God to man "in his SON" (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>); not, as some interpret, the speaking through Moses himself in the Law. Moses was inferior to Christ, not only in respect to his personal position as a servant, but also in respect to his work as such; which was only to testify beforehand, typically and prophetically, to a fuller revelation to come. <span class="cmt_word">Whose house we are</span>. Here begins the transition to the warning intended when the "holy brethren" were first called on to "consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession," who has now been seen to be so much greater than Moses. We Christians constitute this completed "house of God," over which Christ reigns as Son; if only warned by the example of the Israelites under Moses, we forfeit not our higher calling. This condition is expressed by <span class="cmt_word">If we hold fast the confidence</span> (or, <span class="accented">our confidence</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and the rejoicing</span> (rather, <span class="accented">boast</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> our) <span class="cmt_word">hope firm unto the end</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span> (often rendered "boldness;" see below, <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 35</a>) is the confidence felt by assured believers; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the boast thereupon ensuing. This word (as also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is often used by St. Paul (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>: 9:15; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-14.htm">2 Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-3.htm">2 Corinthians 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-26.htm">Philippians 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>). Its proper meaning is not (as is by many sup- posed) the <span class="accented">materies gloriandi</span>, but the uttered boast itself (see note on 1 Corinthians 5:6, in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). The con- eluding words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, are omitted in the Codex Vatican, and, notwithstanding the preponderance of authority in their favor, <span class="accented">may</span> have been interpolated (as is supposed by Mill, Tischendorf, Alford, and Delitzsch) from ver. 14, especially as the reading is not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, so as to agree with the substantive immediately preceding, but <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, as in ver. 14.

The warning, thus led up to, is now introduced by a long quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>, which is cited at length, because the writer is about to dwell on its whole significance in the remainder of this and also in the succeeding chapter. The warning is connected by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> with the conclusion of ver. 6. <span class="accented">Since</span> our continuing to be God's house is on the condition of our steadfastness, <span class="accented">therefore</span> beware of failing, as the Israelites referred to by the psalmist did. With regard to the construction of the passage, there is some difficulty in discovering the apodosis to the initiatory <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> ("<span class="accented">as</span> saith the Holy Ghost"). It seems best to suppose one understood, being suggested by "harden not your hearts," which occurs m the midst of the quotation. Sentences thus grammatically incomplete are in the style of St. Paul. Otherwise the apodosis must be found in <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (ver. 12), the long intervening passage being parenthetical. It is, after all, only a question of grammatical construction; in any case the general meaning is clear. As to the successive clauses of the quotation from <a href="../../par/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>. (vers. 7-11), it is to be observed that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "If ye will hear his voice" may probably mean in the Hebrew, "Oh that ye would hear his voice!" But the Greek of the LXX., cited in the Epistle, is capable of the same meaning. Here, again, the meaning of the particular phrase does not affect the drift of the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Harden not your hearts" expresses the abjuration which ensues from resistance of grace. Elsewhere such judicial hardening is attributed to God; as when he is said to have hardened Pharaoh's heart (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>). The two modes of expression involve no difference of doctrine. It is God's doing as being judicial; man's as being due to his own perversity. As in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness. Here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, which is from the LXX., may mean "<span class="accented">at</span> the time <span class="accented">of"</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), or "according to," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "after the manner of." The former agrees best with the Hebrew psalm, which has "As at Meribah, as on the day of Massah in the wilderness," referring to the two places called by these names from what occurred there, when the people murmured for want of water. The first occurrence was at Rephidim, in the wilderness of Sin, at the commencement of the wandering (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-8</a>); the second was in the wilderness of Zin, near Kadesh, towards the end of the forty years (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-14</a>). Both names are assigned to the former place in <a href="../../par/exodus/17-7.htm">Exodus 17:7</a>; but elsewhere they are distinguished (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>). In the text, following the LXX., equivalents of the Hebrew names are given, Massah being rendered literally by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: Meribah (equivalent to "strife ") by the unusual word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs only here and in the psalm, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is common in the LXX. The root of the word being <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> ("bitter"), it may possibly have been suggested by the occurrence at Marah (equivalent to "bitterness"), where there was also a murmuring about water (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> being the LXX. equivalent of Marah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> When (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, as is common in the LXX. and New Testament) your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years. In place of the reading of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> ("proved me"), which agrees with the LXX., the authority of manuscripts is in favor of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. This again, like the ether variations of reading, is of no importance with regard to the meaning. But further, in the original Hebrew, and apparently in the LXX., "forty years" is connected with the clause that follows: "forty years long was I grieved," etc.; whereas, in the text, the interposition of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> at the beginning of ver. 10, necessitates its connection with "saw my works." It is possible that the writer of the Epistle intended a reference to the corresponding forty years from the manifestation of Christ to the destruction of Jerusalem, which were drawing to their close at the time of writing, and during which the Israelites of his day were trying God by their rejection of the gospel, or, in the case of some of the believers addressed, by their wavering allegiance to it. The supposition that this idea was in the writer's mind is supported by the fact that Jewish writers refer to the psalm as assigning forty years for <span class="accented">the days of the Messiah</span> (see reference in Bleek, Delitzsch, Alford, etc.). That the writer had an intention in his variation from the original is the more likely from his following it correctly afterwards in ver. 17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest</span>. The reference here is to <a href="../../par/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21</a>, etc., beginning with the Divine oath, "As truly as I live," which is again repeated in ver. 28. The occasion was not the murmuring either at Massah or at Meribah, but the general rebellion of the whole congregation after the return of the spies, betokening a universal spirit of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (cf. ver. 19).

Here begins definitely the hortatory application of the warning of the ninety-fifth psalm. Its drift, to the end of the chapter, is: You, being called under the SON to a far higher position than your fathers under Moses were, but the retention of your position being, as theirs was, conditional on your faithfulness, see that you do not forfeit it, as some of you may be in danger of doing. That you may, if you are not careful, is shown by the very warning of the psalm, and by the example of your fathers, referred to in the psalm, <span class="accented">all</span> of whom, though called, failed of attainment through unbelief. It is implied all along that the "today" of the psalm includes the present day of grace, and points to a truer rest than that of Canaan, still offered to the faithful. But the full bringing out of this thought is reserved for the next chapter. On the language of ver. 12 we observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The same form of warning, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>, occurs <span class="accented">infra <a href="../../par/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12</a>:</span>25, but then, suitably to the context, followed by a subjunctive. Here the future indicative which follows, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, denotes a fact in the future, distinctly apprehended as possible (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). It had not ensued as yet, nor does the writer anticipate the probability of its being the case with <span class="accented">all</span> his readers; but in the state of feeling with regard to the gospel among the Hebrew Christians which the whole Epistle was intended to counteract, he <span class="accented">sees</span> ground for fearing it in the case of <span class="accented">some.</span> Their present wavering might result in apostasy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> It is not necessary to analyze the expression," an evil heart of unbelief," so as to settle whether the evil heart is regarded as the result of unbelief, or unbelief of the evil heart; the main point to be observed is that unbelief is connected with moral culpability, as is implied further in ver. 13. The unbelief so condemned in Holy Scripture is not mere intellectual incapacity; it is condemned only so far as man is responsible for it on account of his own willful perversity or carelessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The outcome of such "<span class="accented">evil</span> heart of unbelief," if allowed to become fixed and permanent, will be apostasy (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>) from "the living God," from him who is Eternal Life and the Source of all life and salvation. The thought of the momentous consequence of the falling away of Christians after light enjoyed is prominent in the Epistle (see especially <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.; Hebrews 10:26, etc.). The expression," the living God," further directs attention to the revelation of God in the Old Testament, in which he is continually so designated, and to the thought that it is the same God who has revealed himself finally in the SON. Addressing Hebrew Christians, the writer may mean to say," In apostatizing from Christ you would be cutting yourselves off from the God of your whole ancestral faith." There <span class="accented">may</span> be an intended allusion, too, to the oath, already referred to, of <a href="../../par/numbers/14-21.htm">Numbers 14:21, 28</a>, the form of which in the original is," As I live" (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.).

Here again, as in ver. 12, the possible result of obdurate unbelief is distinctly traced to moral culpability. Sin is a deceiver (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-11.htm">Romans 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>); it distorts the spiritual vision, causes us to take false views of things, and to lose our clear view of truth; and continued dalliance with sin may hare its result in final obduracy, which, as above remarked, is our own doing as it comes of our sin, God's doing as it comes of his judgment. The sin contemplated in the case of the Hebrew Christians as not unlikely to have its result in obduracy was, not only imperfect appreciation of the true character of the gospel revelation, and consequent remissness in mutual admonition and attendance at Christian worship (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>), but also, as a further consequence of such remissness, failure in the moral purity of life, the active charity, the disentanglement from the world, and the endurance of persecution, required of Christians. This appears from the earnest exhortations that follow afterwards against all such shortcomings (see especially <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-26, 32-39</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1-18</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1-20</a>). It was especially by conscientious perseverance in the religious life that they might hope to keep their religious faith steadfast and unclouded to the end; in accordance with Christ's own saying, "If any man <span class="accented">will</span> do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God."

This is a repetition in another form of the assertion of our position as Christians, with the appended condition, in ver. 6. It is a question whether <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means that we partake <span class="accented">of</span> Christ as being in communion with him, or that we are partakers <span class="accented">with</span> him of the glory he has won for us (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>).

Cf. also in the New Testament, <a href="../../par/luke/5-7.htm">Luke 5:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though without an expressed genitive following, occurs in the sense of "partner." Further, the second sense accords better than the first with the view of our relation to Christ so far set forth in the Epistle. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> On the word <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "confidence"), see what was said under Hebrews 1:3. All the ancient interpreters understood it here in the same general sense as in the former passage - that of <span class="accented">substance</span> or <span class="accented">subsistence</span>, either as denoting our subsistence as members of Christ, or our faith regarded as the substance of our Christian life, or with other modifications of the general meaning. Modern commentators agree in understanding merely the sense in which the word is found to be commonly used by the Alexandrian writers - that of <span class="accented">confidence</span>, derived from the physical conception of a firm foundation. It thus corresponds with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 6. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "The beginning" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of this confidence refers to the earlier stage of the experiences of the Hebrew Christians, before their faith had shown any signs of wavering. There is no sufficient ground for Ebrard's inference from this expression, that the Epistle was not addressed to the Hebrew Church at large, which was the oldest of all Churches, but to "a circle of catechumens and neophytes." The phrase does not imply that the "beginning" was recent. All it need mean is, "Go on as you began." Further, we find, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, a distinct intimation that the Church addressed is one of old standing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Unto the end "may have an individual reference to the end of life, or (the Church being addressed as a community expecting the second advent) a general one to the close of the period of grace during which "<span class="accented">it</span> is called Today."

Many, taking the words as the beginning of a new sentence, have been at pains to discover the apodosis to them. Cbrysostom, Grotius, Rosenmuller, and others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-1.htm">Hebrews 4:1</a>; notwithstanding the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which seems evidently to introduce a new sentence, and the long parenthesis which, on this supposition, intervenes. Others find it in <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("harden not your hearts"), in the middle of the citation of ver. 16, as if the writer of the Epistle adopted these words as his own. Delitzsch finds it in ver. 16, taken as an interrogation (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span>: see below); thus: "When it is said, Today...  harden not your hearts as in the provocation,...  who did provoke? Nay, did not all?" The <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> he accounts for by its idiomatic use found in such passages as <a href="../../par/acts/8-31.htm">Acts 8:31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a>, conveying the sense of the English, "<span class="accented">Why</span>, who did provoke?" But this use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, obvious in the texts adduced as parallel, would be forced here; the structure of the sentence does not easily lend itself to it. Still, this is the view taken by Tholuck, Bleek, De Wette, Lunemann, and others, as well as Delitzsch. But, notwithstanding such weighty support, difficulties are surely best avoided by taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, not as commencing a new sentence, but in connection with ver. 14 preceding, as it seems most natural to take it in the absence of any connecting particle to mark a new proposition. In this case the translation of the A.V. gives a fully satisfactory sense: "If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end, while it is still being said, To-day," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (as in ver. 13) "so long as it is called Today." Ebrard, Alford, and others, taking the same view of the connection of the words, prefer the translation, "In that it is said." But the other seems more in accordance with the thought pervading the passage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For who, when they heard, provoked? Nay, did not all those who came out of Egypt by Moses</span>. That both these clauses are interrogative, and not as taken in the A.V., is now the prevalent view. The reasons for thus understanding them are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the analogy of the two following verses, both of which are interrogative, and in the first of which a question is similarly answered by putting another; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the sense required. If the clauses were assertions, they could only be meant to express that the provocation was not universal, inasmuch as Joshua and Caleb (and it might be some few others) remained faithful. But to say this is unnecessary and irrelevant to the argument, the drift of which is to warn by "the example of unbelief;" and could <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> ("some") possibly be used to denote the whole congregation with the exception of so few? It is to be observed, too, that the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> at the beginning of the second clause is a proper Greek expression (equivalent to "nay") in the case of one question being answered by another (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/17-7.htm">Luke 17:7, 8</a>). This verse, then (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> retaining its usual sense of "for"), begins a proof, put in the form of a series of questions, of the preceding implied proposition, viz. that the retention of Christian privilege is dependent on perseverance, and that the privilege may be forfeited. In order to show this fully, the history of <a href="../../par/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>, referred to in the warning of the psalm, is examined in connection with the successive expressions of the warning; and it thus appears that all who came out of Egypt by Moses (the small exception of the faithful spies being disregarded) provoked God, and so forfeited their privilege, and that the cause of their failure was sin, disobedience, and, at the root of all, unbelief. The conclusion is obvious that, as their example is held out in the psalm as a warning to us, we may, all or any of us, similarly forfeit our higher calling. That the psalm is a warning to us, the rest it points to being the rest won for us by Christ, is more fully shown in the following chapter. We observe how the leading words in <a href="../../par/psalms/95.htm">Psalm 95</a>. are taken in succession in the three successive verses  <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 16, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 17, <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 18 - and how answers to the three questions suggested by these words are found in <a href="../../par/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. - to the first, in vers. 2, 10, etc., "<span class="accented">all</span> the children of Israel," "all the congregation;" to the second, in vers. 29-34, with citation of the words used; to the third, in vers. 21-24. It is to be observed, further, that it is not simply <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but its exhibition in actual sin and disobedience (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), that is spoken of as calling forth the Divine wrath and the Divine oath. The second of the above words implies more titan "believed not" (as in the A.V.); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in implying disobedience or contumacy. And this view of the case of the Israelites agrees entirely with the historical record, where an actual rebellion is spoken of a refusal to go on with the work they had been called to. It suits also the application to the case of the Hebrew Christians, among whom (as has been said) it was not only wavering of faith, but, as its consequence, remissness in moral duty and in the facing of trial, of which the writer of the Epistle had perceived symptoms, and on the ground of which he warns them to take heed lest growing indifference should be hardened into apostasy. But in both instances, as faith is the root of all virtue, so want of it was the cause, and again the growing result, of moral decadence. And so the argument is summed up in the concluding verse, <span class="cmt_word">And we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

This verse is a renewed warning against remissness, based (as is shown by the connecting <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) on the preceding argument, but introducing also, by means of the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., a new thought, the elucidation of which is the subject of what follows. The new thought is that the true "rest of God," typified only by the rest of Canaan, remains still for the attainment of Christians. That this is the case has not yet been shown; and hence the clause, "a promise being still left." etc., does not point to a conclusion already arrived at, but to what is coming. The new thought is taken up in ver. 2, and what has been thus intimated in ver. 1 is asserted as a conclusion after proof in ver. 9. <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, etc. A different view of the drift of the warning in this verse, main-rained very decidedly by Ebrard, demands attention. It rests on the interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which is taken to mean "should think that he has come too late," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the promise of the rest, under the idea that its meaning had been exhausted in the rest of Canaan. It may be said in support of this view that such is the most obvious meaning of the phrase; that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament most commonly means "think" or "suppose;" that the primary sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is that of being behindhand, either in place or in time; and that the perfect <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is thus accounted for, whereas, according to the usual interpretation, the whole phrase is unsuitable: why was not <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> written, if a mere warning against remissness was intended? Further, it may be said that what immediately follows is in favor of this view of the purport of the caution in ver. 1, being an evident carrying out of its idea. Thus the verse is supposed to be not at all a continuation of the previous hortatory section, but rather serving as the thesis of the coming argumentative section, though put in the form of a caution because imperfect appreciation of the view to be now established was at the root of the danger of the Hebrew Christians. Some of them at least did not fully grasp the true character of the gospel as being the fulfill-merit of the old dispensation, the realization of its types and promises. They were inclined to rest in the Law as a revelation to which the gospel was only supplementary, and hence to regard the promised land, the offer of which was before their time, as the only rest intended; and therefore the writer, after adducing the example of the Israelites under Moses as a warning against remissness, prefaces his exposition. of the true rest of God by a warning against misapprehending it. But against this view of the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> there are the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> suggests rather (like <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) a warning against conduct that might lead to forfeiture than a correction of an inadequate conception; and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> connects the warning with what has gone before, in which the view of what the true rest is has not entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Though <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is most frequently used in the New Testament in its sense of "thinking," "<span class="accented">seeming</span> to one's self," yet it has there, as in Greek generally, the sense also of "appearing," "seeming to others;" and certainly, as far as the word itself is concerned, may have this sense here. <span class="accented">Also</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, though its primary idea (as of <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is that of "coming after," is nevertheless invariably used in the New Testament to express "deficiency," or "falling short" (cf. especially in this Epistle, <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>): it is never elsewhere (though capable of the meaning) used to express lateness in time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the sense of "<span class="accented">seem</span> to have fallen short" (rather than <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>) is capable of being accounted for. One explanation of it, adopted by Alford, is indeed hardly tenable. He accounts for the past tense by supposing reference to the final judgment; taking it to mean, "<span class="accented">lest</span> any one of you should then appear [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> be found] to have fallen short." But the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however used, refers, not to what is made evident, but to what is thought or seems, refuses to be thus misinterpreted. It is better to take it as a softening expression. We may suppose that the writer (with a delicacy that reminds us of St. Paul) was unwilling to imply his own expectation of any failure; and so he only bids his readers beware of so living as even to present the appearance of it or suggest the thought of it to others. According to this view, the tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is intelligible, the supposed deficiency spoken of being previous to its being perceived or suspected. It is not <span class="accented">necessary</span> to supply an understood genitive, such as "the promise," or "the rest," after <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It <span class="accented">may</span> be used (as elsewhere) absolutely, to express deficiency or failure; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the conditions required for attainment. One view of its meaning is that it has reference to the idea of being behindhand in a race: but there is nothing in the context to suggest this figure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> It is not necessary that ver. 1 should express <span class="accented">only</span> the idea of the following argument; it does sufficiently express it in the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; and it is in the style of this Epistle to connect new trains of argument by a continuous chain of thought with what has gone before (cf. the beginning of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>. and 3.). Though there is uncertainty as to the sequence of thought in the several clauses of the following argument (vers. 2-11), its general drift is clear. Its leading ideas are these: The invitation to enter God's rest contained in the psalm shows that the rest of Canaan, which, though forfeited under Moses, had long been actually attained under Joshua, was not the final rest intended. What, then, is meant by this remarkable term, "my rest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God's own rest? Our thoughts go back to the beginning of the Bible, where a rest of God himself is spoken of; where he is said to have rested on the seventh day from all his works. Participation, then, in that heavenly rest - a true sabbath rest with God - is what the term implies. Though this rest began "from the foundation of the world," man's destined share in if, however long delayed, was intimated by the typical history of the Israelites under Moses, and by the warning and renewed invitation of the psalm. This renewed invitation makes it plain that it is still attainable by God's people. It has at last been made attainable by Christ. who, as our great High Priest, has himself entered it, and leads us into it if we are but faithful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-2.htm">Hebrews 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For truly we have had good tidings</span> (or, <span class="accented">a gospel</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, not being mingled by faith with those that heard it</span>.

But the passage is still one of singular difficulty, on account both of the various readings of it, and of the peculiarity of the language used whatever reading be adopted.

But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span>the great preponderance of ancient authority (including that of all the uncial manuscripts except <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>) supports <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> The latter, then, must be accepted as the true reading, if authority alone is to be our guide. But then comes the difficulty of making any sense of it. The only way of doing so is to understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> ("those who heard") in the sense of "those who hearkened;" the sense of the passage being "The word of hearing did not profit them, because they were not united by faith with those who not only heard, but hearkened and obeyed." Most of the Fathers, reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> to refer in this sense to Caleb and Joshua. But, if what has been said above be true as to these exceptions to the general unbelief not having been in the writer's mind, such an allusion is highly improbable. Some (Alford, e.g.) take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> with no historical reference, but as denoting hearkeners generally. Alford, however, though adopting this as the best solution of an acknowledged difficulty, confesses himself not satisfied with it, as well he may. A very serious objection to either view, even apart from the strangeness of the whole expression if such be its meaning, is that, though the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is certainly used elsewhere in the sense thus assigned to it, the whole context here suggests different one. Cf. <span class="accented">supra</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16</a>), <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: and especially <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> immediately preceding. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting hearing only, seems to have suggested the use of the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to which it would therefore be most unnatural to assign a different meaning. If, then, all devices for making sense of the best supported text prove unsatisfactory, and if the Textus Receptus gives an intelligible meaning, we might surely be justified in adopting the latter, however ill supported. Internal evidence (though great caution should be used in our estimate of it) need not yield entirely to external, nor common sense to authority, in the determination of true readings. But in this case the argument from internal probability has now been strengthened by the discovery of the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Sinaitic Codex (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>). This, then, being adopted, though the expression be peculiar, the meaning is no longer obscure, whether we take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> as governed by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It may be either that "the word of hearing did not profit them because it was not mingled with their faith to those that heard;" or "because it was not mingled by faith with those that heard it." In the latter case the idea is that of the necessity of the spoken word entering the heart, and being (so to speak) assimilated by the hearers through the instrumentality of faith, in order to profit them.

This seems to be a concise enunciation of the proof, unfolded in the verses that follow, of the true rest being one into which Christians have still an entrance. The idea is that, though God's own rest had been from the beginning, and man had not yet entered it, yet the possibility of his doing so had not ceased to be intimated: it had continued open potentially to man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-4.htm">Hebrews 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he hath said somewhere</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>) <span class="cmt_word">of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested the seventh day from all his works; and in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest</span>. Here the argument is carried out. The first passage quoted shows what must be understood by the "rest of God;" the second shows that it still remains open, that "it remaineth that some should enter thereinto." This being the case - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-5.htm">Hebrews 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">And in this <i>place</i> again, If they shall enter into my rest.</div><div class="comm">

But here the thought is suggested that the Israelites had <span class="accented">not</span> finally failed, for that, though those under Moses did so, the next generation under Joshua did attain the promised land. No, it is replied; the rest of the promised land was but a type after all; it was not the true rest of God: otherwise the psalmist could not have still assigned a day for entering it so long after the arrival at Shiloh; -

There are two ways of understanding this verse. Its general intention is, indeed, clear. It accounts for the use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> which precedes, expressing that the true meaning of "God's rest" is not satisfied by any earthly rest, but only by one like his. The question is whether the verse is to be taken as a general proposition or as referring specifically to Christ. In favor of the latter view is the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The <span class="accented">literal</span> translation would be "He that entered...  himself also <span class="accented">rested."</span> Ebrard, on this ground, strenuously defends the reference to Christ; and also on the ground of parallelism with <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first division of the general argument. In the first division (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>.) the course of thought was - Dominion over creation has been assigned to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man fulfils his destiny. In this second division the corresponding course of drought is - God's rest has been offered to man: man has not attained it: Jesus has; and in Jesus man may enter it. And thus (as has been explained above) the conclusion that Jesus is the High Priest of humanity is led up to by two parallel lines of argument. But the third of the propositions of the second line of argument (corresponding to <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a> in the first) is not distinctly expressed unless it be in the verse before us; and therefore this verse, on this ground as well as that of the use of the aorist, is taken to refer to Christ. On the other hand, it is argued (Bleek, Do Wette, Delitzsch, etc.) that, if a specific reference to Christ had been intended, he would have been mentioned, so as to make the meaning clear; and secondly, that the aorist <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> is legitimate, though the proposition be a general one. Delitzsch explains it thus: "The author might have written <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> or (more classically) <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but he has taken up into the main proposition the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which properly belongs (according to <a href="../../par/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2</a>) to the clause of comparison: whosoever has entered God's rest, of him the '<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> holds good in the same manner as of God." And, further, it is to be observed that the Greek aorist may sometimes be put for the present, "to express an action completely determined, every doubt as to its truth and unalterableness being removed" (Matthiae, 'Gr. Gram.,' &sect; 506). In this instance the idea might be - he that has entered into God's rest rested, when he so entered, from all his works, etc. On the whole, it appears that specific reference to Christ is <span class="accented">not</span> apparent from the immediate context, or required by the mere language used. Still, in consideration of the general argument, we may take the writer to have meant his readers to understand that it was Christ who <span class="accented">had</span> so entered the rest of God, so as to lead God's people into it. That this is so appears from ver. 14,  <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x37e;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, which seems to require that preceding link of thought. - Among man's deepest feelings is a longing for rest. Haply in the freshness and ardor of early life not deeply felt, it recurs from time to time, and grows stronger with advancing years. Nothing in life fully satisfies this longing. Labors, distresses, disappointments, anxieties, never allow the desired repose. Few there are whose hearts have not sometimes echoed the psalmist's words, "Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then would I flee away, and be at rest!" Many since Job have felt something of his longing to be where "the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." Is there to be no satisfaction ever of this deep human craving? Holy Scripture meets it as it meets all others. It spoke of a rest of God above creation from the beginning of time; it intimated man's part and interest in it by the weekly sabbath which he was to keep with God. But this was, after all, but a symbol and earnest of something unattained. At length a fuller realization of the longed-for rest was held out to the chosen people, and the Promised Land was pictured beforehand in the colors of an earthly Paradise. Forfeited, when first offered, through the people's unworthiness (representing by an historical parable the bar to man's entrance into the eternal rest), it was attained at last. But the true rest still came not. Canaan, like the sabbath, proved but a symbol of something unattained. Yet the old longing for rest went on, and inspired men went on proclaiming it as attainable and still to come. The irrepressible craving, the suggestive symbols, the prophetic anticipations, are all fulfilled in Christ. He, when he had passed with us through this earthly scene of labor, entered, with our nature, into that eternal rest of God, to prepare a place for us, having by his atonement removed the bar to human entrance. Through our faith in him we are assured that our deep-seated craving for satisfaction unattained as yet, which we express by the term "<span class="accented">rest</span>," is a true inward prophecy, and that, though we find it not <span class="accented">here</span>, we may through him, if we are faithful, confidently expect it <span class="accented">there</span>, where "<span class="accented">beyond</span> these voices there is peace." There now follows (vers. 11-14) a renewal of the warning of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-4:1</a>, urged now with increased force in view of the danger of slighting such a revelation as the gospel has been shown to be; after which (ver. 14, etc.) come words of encouragement, based on the view, now a second time arrived at, of Christ being our great High Priest. And thus the exposition of his priesthood, which follows in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5.htm">Hebrews 5</a>, is led up to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-11.htm">Hebrews 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us therefore do our diligence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, so translated in A.V. <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9, 21</a>) <span class="cmt_word">to enter into that rest, lest any one fall after the same example of disobedience</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: not <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which means "unbelief"). It is a question, though not at all affecting the general sense of the passage, whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> should not he translated "fall <span class="accented">into</span> the same example." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> has undoubtedly the sense of "to fall into," and is frequently so used in the LXX., and the subordinate position of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> in the sentence - between <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - is against its being used absolutely as the emphatic word. If so, the meaning will be "fall into the same <span class="accented">exemplar</span> of disobedience," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the kind of disobedience of which that of the Israelites was a sample. This interpretation of the phrase, being that of the Vulgate, is supported by Alford, Davison, Lunemann; though most modern commentators (Bengel, Bleek, De Wette, Tholuck, Delitzsch, Wordsworth), with Chrysostom, take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> absolutely, as in <a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a> (<span class="accented">ruat</span>, Bengel), and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as meaning, "so as to present the same (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> a like) example of disobedience," the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, according to Delitzsch, being the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> of state or condition. The warning is next enforced by a vivid representation of the penetrating and resistless power of the "Word of God." The question arises whether "the Word of God" is here to be understood in St. John's sense of the <span class="accented">Hypostatic Word, i.e.</span> the Second Person of the holy Trinity, who became incarnate in Christ. It is so understood by the Fathers generally; and the fact of this Epistle being tinged generally with the thought and terminology of Philo (whose use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, derived from the Platonic philosophy in combination with Jewish theology, seems to anticipate in some degree, however vaguely, the doctrine of St. John) gives some countenance to the view. But against it are the following considerations: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Christ is not elsewhere in this Epistle designated as "the Word" but as "the SON." His eternal relation to the Father, though otherwise plainly intimated, is not expressed by this term, as it was by St. John. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The description of the Word, <span class="accented">as</span> "<span class="accented">sharper</span> than any two-edged sword," is not suitable to the Hypostatic Word himself, but rather to the utterance of his power. Thus in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "<span class="accented">the</span> Son of <span class="accented">man</span>," and in <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, "<span class="accented">he</span> whose name is called the Word of <span class="accented">God</span>," has a "<span class="accented">sharp</span> two-edged sword proceeding out of his mouth." The sword is not himself, but that which "came forth out of his mouth." Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, "He shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked;" cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, "The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God." Hence, notwithstanding the prevailing view of the Fathers, it seems best to understand the term here as meaning generally the Divine utterance, without definite reference to the Hypo-static Word. It was the Word of God, in this sense, that debarred the ancient Israelites from their rest, and doomed them in the wilderness; it is the same Word which still more, as being uttered in the Son, is so searching and resistless now. True, it is through the Hypostatic Word that the Godhead has ever operated, of old as well as now, being God's eternal utterance of himself: the only question is whether this truth is here intended to be expressed, or, in other words, whether <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has here the personal sense in which St. John uses the term. It is possible that the writer passes in thought to a personal sense in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of ver. 13, where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span> refer to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> preceding, rather than to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. But certainly at the beginning of the passage this specific sense does not seem to be suggested either by the context or the language used. Ver. 12. - For living is the Word of God, and powerful (or, <span class="accented">effectual</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="../../par/philemon/1-6.htm">Philemon 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>), and sharper than any two- edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Observe how the predicates form a climax. The Word of God is, first, <span class="accented">living</span>, instinct with the life of the living God who utters it, itself a living power (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>); then, not only so, but also <span class="accented">operative, effective</span> of its purpose; then, in this its operation, more keenly <span class="accented">cutting</span> than any sword; cutting so as to <span class="accented">perpetrate</span> through and through - through the whole inner being of man to its inmost depths; then, in doing so, <span class="accented">discerning</span> and opening to judgment all the secrets of his consciousness. This description of the power of the Word of God is given as a reason fur the warning, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> etc., "Let us give diligence," etc.; <span class="accented">for</span>, if we slight the Word of God, we can have no escape from its irresistible operation; we shall be thoroughly exposed and inevitably judged. The view of the Word of God having a sharply <span class="accented">cutting</span> operation is found in Philo, from whom Bleek cites a series of passages cognate to this in the Epistle. Cf. especially one in the treatise, 'Quis Rerum Divinorum Haeres.:' <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>    <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;</span>, etc. And for the comparison to a sword, cf. (as above referred to) <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; and <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>. The true reading of the part of the sentence, "of soul and spirit," etc., is <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus after <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> being ill supported. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, after <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, is therefore most naturally taken, and so as to give the best sense, in the sense of "both," not "and;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the second clause is not to be taken as denoting a further dividing - of the bodily parts as well as of the soul and spirit, but as expressing, by recurrence to the figure of a sword, the thoroughness of the division of soul and spirit. Further, the division spoken of is surely not of the soul <span class="accented">from</span> the spirit, as some have taken it. Delitzsch, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, explains to this effect - that in fallen man his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which proceeded from God and carries in itself the Divine image, has become, "as it were, extinguished;" that "through the operation of grace man recalls to mind his own true nature, though shattered by sin;" "that heavenly nature or' man reappears when Christ is formed in him;" and thus the Word of God "marks out and separates" the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in him from the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> in which it had been, "<span class="accented">as</span> it were, <span class="accented">extinguished."</span> Then, taking the clause, <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, to express a further process of dissection, he explains by saying that the Word of God "exhibits to man the fact that ungodly powers are working also in his <span class="accented">bodily</span> frame, which has now in every joint and chord and marrow become the seat of sin and death, and so "<span class="accented">goes</span> on to scrutinize" his bodily as well as his spiritual part," and "lays bare before the eyes of God and before his own the whole man thus described." But the idea of the separation, in the above sense, of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, even if tenable, is certainly far-fetched, and that of the corporeal dissection supposed is hardly intelligible. Further, the "dividing" of the bodily parts spoken of in the text (whether an illustration or a further process) does not suggest the separation of one part from another, since a sword does not divide the joints or the limbs (whichever be meant by <span class="accented">apathy</span>) <span class="accented">from</span> the marrow, though it may penetrate both. We may explain thus: It is well known that St. Paul divides man's complex nature into body, soul, and spirit - <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>). His bodily organization (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) is not apparently here under consideration, except in regard to the figure of the sword; the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> is his animal life or soul, the seat (so to speak) of his sensations, and of his natural affections and desires; his <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is the more Divine part of his nature, in virtue of which he has a conscience, aspires after holiness, apprehends spiritual mysteries, holds communion with God, and is influenced by the Divine Spirit. The idea, then, is that, as a very keen sword not only cuts through the joints dividing bone from bone, but also through the bones themselves into the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates and discloses not,, . only. the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> too, "piercing through soul and spirit, <span class="accented">yea</span> [with reference to the illustration used] through both joints [or, 'limbs'] and marrow." Ebrard, taking <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> in the sense of "limbs" (a sense in which the word is used, though that of "joints" is its proper and more usual one), regards these and the "marrow" as corresponding respectively to the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>: the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> being understood as "something lying deep in man, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> lying still deeper." Thus as a very trenchant sword cuts through, not only the limbs, but also the marrow within them, so the Word of God penetrates, not only that part of human consciousness which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span>, but also that deeper and more inward part which is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. But the general sense of the passage is plain enough without our supposing this strict analogy to have been intended. Expositors, in their analysis of the meaning of passages, may often detect more than the author thought cf. On <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "a discerner of"), cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24, 25</a>, where the effects of the Word of God, brought to bear through the gift of prophecy on one without the gift entering into a congregation of prophesying Christians, are thus described: "<span class="accented">he</span> is convinced of all, he is judged [rather, 'examined,' 'scrutinized,' <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] of all; the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you [or, 'among you'] of a truth." So searching and judicial is the power of the Word of God, that it reaches and discloses the inmost depths of a man's consciousness - discloses them to himself, and, though he should resist, leaves him without escape, exposed and judged. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">For the word of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</div><div class="comm">

The main difficulty in this verse is as to the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> (translated "<span class="accented">laid</span> open"). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> (which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament or LXX., but is, with its compound <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, not uncommon in Philo and Josephus) has in classical Greek the sense of "seizing by the throat," or "bending back the neck," as in wrestling. And this, with the further idea of "overthrowing" or "laying prostrate," is the prevailing sense in Philo, from whom Wetstein quotes many passages in illustration. Taking, then, with most modern commentators, the sense of bending back the neck as the primary one, we have only to consider what secondary meaning is here to be attached to it. Some take the idea to be that of being thrown on the ground supine, so as to be thoroughly exposed to view. So Bengel: "<span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="accented">resupino</span>, Graece et Latine dicitur pro patefacio. Corpora quae prona jacent vix nuda censentur; nam se ipsa tegunt: <span class="accented">resupinata</span>, secundum partes nobilissimas quasque et distinctissimas visui patent." Many (Eisner, Wolf, Baumgarten, Kuinoel, Bretschneider, Block, De Wette, etc., following Perizonius, on AElian, 'Vat. Hist.,' 12:58) see an allusion to the Roman custom of exposing criminals "<span class="accented">reducto</span> capite," "<span class="accented">retortis cervieibus</span>," so that all might see their faces (see Suetonius, <span class="accented">Vitel.,'</span> 17; Pliny, 'Panegyr.,' 34. 3). There is, however, no other known instance of the Greek verb being used with this reference, which there seems to be no necessity for assuming. The idea may be simply the general one thus expressed by Delitzsch, "that whatever shamefaced creature bows its head, and would fain withdraw and cloak itself from the eyes of God, has indeed the throat, as it were, bent back before those eyes, with no possibility of escape, exposed and naked to their view." Many of the ancients (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Ecumenius, Theophylact) saw in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> a reference to the treatment of sacrificial victims, as being smitten on the neck or hung by the neck for the purpose of being flayed from the neck downwards, or cut open thence, so as to expose the entrails to view. But no instance is known of such use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, the idea of which may have been suggested to commentators by the figure of the sword in the verse preceding; which figure, however, there is no reason to suppose continued in ver. 13, the idea of which is simply complete exposure, introduced by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span>. The ancients take the concluding expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> whom our account must be given," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">to</span> whom we are responsible as our judge" - in the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The A.V. seems better to give the general idea of relation by the apt phrase, "<span class="accented">with</span> whom we have to do." Of course, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> here has no reference to the Word of God, the recurrence of the word, in a subordinate sense, being merely accidental. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - To the interposed minatory warning of the three preceding verses now succeeds encouragement, based on the view, which has been now a second time led up to, of Christ being our great High Priest, who can both sympathize and succor. The passage answers closely in thought to the conclusion of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>, and might naturally have followed there; but that, before taking up the subject of Christ's priesthood, the writer had another line of thought to pursue, leading up (as has been explained) to the same conclusion. The <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> at the beginning of ver. 14 either connects <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> ("let us hold fast") with the <span class="accented">verses</span> immediately preceding in the sense, "The Word of God being so searching and resistless, let us <span class="accented">therefore</span> hold fast," etc., - in which ease the participial clause <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., is a confirmation of this exhortation (so Delitzsch); or is connected logically with the participial clause as a resumption of the whole preceding argument. Certainly the idea of the participial clause is the prominent one in the writer's mind, what follows being an expansion of it. And the position of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> suggests this connection. It is to be observed that, after the manner of the Epistle, this concluding exhortation serves also as a transition to the subject of the following chapters, and anticipates in some degree what is to be set forth, though all the expressions used have some ground in what has gone before. <span class="cmt_word">Having then a great High Priest who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</span> The rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> in the A.V. ("is passed <span class="accented">into</span> the heavens") is evidently wrong. The idea is that Christ has passed <span class="accented">through</span> the intermediate heavens to the immediate presence of God - to the sphere of the eternal <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>.

Clemens Alexandrinus, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> speaks of seven: <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Cf. also "the heaven and the heaven of heavens" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-6.htm">Nehemiah 9:6</a>), and "who hast set thy glory above the heavens" (<a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>), also "the third heaven," into which St. Paul was rapt (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). Cf. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. The conception of the phrase is that, whatever spheres of created heavens intervene between our earth and the eternal uncreated, beyond them to it Christ has gone, - into "heaven itself (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>);" "before the <span class="accented">face</span> of God" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). From this expression, together with <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a> (above quoted), is rightly deduced the doctrine of Christ s ubiquity even in his human nature. For, carrying that nature with him and still retaining it, he is spoken of as having passed to the region which admits no idea of limitation, and so as to "fill all things." The obvious bearing of this doctrine on that of the presence in the Eucharist may be noted in passing. (It is to be observed that "the heavens" in the plural is used (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-1.htm">Hebrews 8:1</a>) of the seat of the Divine majesty itself to which Christ has gone. It is the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> that determines the meaning here.) The designation, "Jesus the Son of God," draws attention first to the man Jesus who was known by that name in the flesh, and secondly to the "more excellent name," above expatiated on, in virtue of which he "hath passed through the heavens." The conclusion follows that it is the human Jesus, with his humanity, who, being also the Son of God, has so "passed through." There may <span class="accented">possibly</span> (<span class="accented">as</span> some think) be an intention of contrasting him with Joshua (<span class="greek">&#x399;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, ver. 8), who won the entrance into the typical rest. But it is not necessary to suppose this; vers. 8 and 14 are at too great a distance from each other to suggest a connection of thought between them; and besides  <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> occurred similarly at the end of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>, before any mention of Joshua. The epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> distinguishes Christ from all other high priests (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-20.htm">Hebrews 13:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The high priest of the Law passed through the veil to the earthly symbol of the eternal glory; the "great High Priest" has passed through the heavens to the eternal glory itself. As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. on Hebrews 3:1. In consideration of having such a High Priest, who, as is expressed in what follows, can both sympathize and succor, the readers are exhorted to "hold fast," not only their inward faith, but their "confession" of it before men. A besetting danger of the Hebrew Christians was that of shrinking from a full and open confession under the influence of gainsaying or persecution. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For we have not an High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all things tempted like as we are, without sin</span>.

The sequence of thought is, "Let us hold fast our confession, not moved from it by the thought of the superhuman greatness of this High Priest of ours, who hath passed through the heavens; <span class="accented">for</span> he can still sympathize with our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), having undergone our trials."  <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in the New Testament denotes both bodily infirmity, such as disease (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-9.htm">Acts 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>), and also the general weakness of human nature as opposed to Divine power, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-5.htm">2 Corinthians 12:5, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>).

With all human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, of whatever kind, Christ can sympathize in virtue of his own human experience: "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>); "himself <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x391;&#x3c2;</span>, though he now lives <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>).

His temptation was after the likeness of ours, "apart from sin," or "sin except." For similar expressions, though not with definite reference to temptation, cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>. But how is the exception of sin to be understood? Is it that, though, like us, tempted, he, unlike us, resisted temptation? Or is it that his sinless nature was incapable of being even solicited by sin? Now, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means sometimes "to tempt to sin," as Satan or our own lusts tempt us (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>, etc.); and also "to prove.... to try," "to test faithfulness," as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>, etc., in which sense, with reference especially to afflictive trials, the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is commonly used (cf. <a href="../../par/luke/8-13.htm">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/22-18.htm">Luke 22:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>). That Christ was not only subjected to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in this latter sense, but was also directly assailed by the tempter to sin (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), appears from the Gospel record. But here comes in a difficulty. There can, we conceive, be no real temptation where there is no liability to the sin suggested by temptation, still less where there is no possibility of sinning. But can we imagine any such liability, or even possibility, in the case of the Divine and Sinless One? If not, wherein did the temptation consist? How could it be at all like ours, or one through his own experience of which he can sympathize with us? It was for maintaining, on the strength of such considerations, the theoretic peccability of Christ, that Irving was expelled as heretical flora the Presbyterian communion. The question has undoubtedly its serious difficulties in common with the whole subjeer of the Divine and human in Christ. The following thoughts may, however, aid solution. That Christ, in his human nature, partook of all the original affections of humanity - hope, fear, desire, joy, grief, indignation, shrinking from suffering, and the like - is apparent, not only from his life, but also from the fact that his assumption of our humanity would have otherwise been incomplete. Such affections are not in themselves sinful; they only are so when, under temptation, any of them become inordinate, and serve as motives to transgression of duty. He, in virtue of his Divine personality, could not through them be seduced into sin; but it does not follow that he could not, in his human nature, feel their power to seduce, or rather the power of the tempter to seduce through them, and thus have personal experience of man's temptation. St. John says of one" born of God" that he "doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <span class="accented">cannot</span> sin, because he is born of God" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-9.htm">1 John 3:9</a>). He does not mean that the regenerate Christian is not exposed to and does not feel, the power of temptation; only that, so far forth as he lives in the new life from God, he is proof against it; he gives no internal assent to the seduction of the tempter; and so "that wicked one toucheth him net" (ver. 18). What is thus said of one "born of God" may be said much more, and without any qualification, of the Son of God, without denying that he too experienced the power of temptation, though altogether proof against it. Bengel says, "Quomodo autem, <span class="accented">sine pectate</span> tentatus, compati potest tentatis <span class="accented">cum peceato?</span> In intellectu multo acrius anima salvatoris percepit imagines tentantes quam nos infirmi: in voluntato tam celeriter incursum earum retudit quam ignis aquae guttulam sibi objectam. Expertus est igitur qua virtute sit opus ad tentationes vincendas. Compati potest nam et sine peccato, et tamen vere est tentatus."

In this sense Philo uses <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> to express Abraham's sober grief after the death of Sarah (2:37) and Jacob's patience under his afflictions (2:45). The verb, followed, as here, by a dative of persons, may be taken, therefore, to denote moderation of feeling towards the persons indicated, such moderation being especially opposed in the case before us, where the persons are the ignorant and erring, to excess of severe or indignant feeling. Moderation, indeed, in this regard seems to have been the idea generally attached to the compound (cf. Plut., 'De Ira Cohib.' p. 453, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Josephus also speaks of the emperors Vespasian and Titus as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in their attitude towards the Jews after long hostility ('Ant.,' 12:3 2). This, then, being the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it is obvious how the capacity of it is essential to the idea of a high priest as being one who is resorted to as a mediator by a people laden with infirmities, to represent them and to plead for them. It is not of necessity implied that every high priest was personally <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>: it is the ideal of his office that is spoken cf. And, in the case of human high priests, this ideal was fulfilled by their being themselves human, encompassed themselves with the infirmity of those for whom they mediated. Christ also, so far, evidently fulfils the condition. For, though he is afterwards distinguished (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-28.htm">Hebrews 7:28</a>) from priests having themselves infirmity, yet he had, in his human nature, experienced what it was: "He was crucified <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-4.htm">2 Corinthians 13:4</a>); "Himself took our infirmities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), and bare our sicknesses" (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>); the agony in the garden (whatever its mysterious import, of which more below)expressed personal experience of human <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Alford denies that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in the sense supposed by him to be here intended, can be attributed to Christ, and hence that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> can apply to him (but see above on Hebrews 4:15, and below on vers. 3, 7).

Consequently, their sin offering for themselves, in the first place, was a prominent part of the ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, which the writer may be supposed to have especially in view (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.). But can we suppose any corresponding necessity in the case of Christ? The argument does not absolutely require that we should, since the obligation of the Levitical high priest may be adduced only in proof of his own experience of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Christ, though under no such obligation, might still fulfill the requisites of a high priest, expressed in the case of sinful high priests by the obligation to offer for themselves; and we may (as Ebrard says) leave it to the writer to show hew he does fulfill them. Whether, however, there was in Christ's own experience anything corresponding to the high priest's offering for himself will be considered under vers. 7, 8. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as <i>was</i> Aaron.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but being called of God</span> (the 5 of Textus Receptus before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "he that is called," as in A.V. - has very slight authority), <span class="cmt_word">even as was Aaron.</span> This verse expresses the second essential of a high priest, Divine appointment, for assurance of the efficacy of his mediation.

Here begins the proof that Christ fulfils the two requirements, that mentioned second in the previous statement being taken first in the proof - <span class="accented">chiastically</span>, as is usual in this Epistle. The expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, rather than <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>, may have reference to the glory wherewith Christ is crowned in his exalted position as Priest-King (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. As he saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</span>. These two texts (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>) must be taken together for the proof required. The first (commented on under Hebrews 1:5) shows the Lord's appointment of Christ to his kingly office as Son; the second shows that this kingly office carries with it, also by Divine appointment, an eternal priesthood. Christ's entry into this kingly priesthood is best conceived as inaugurated by his resurrection, after accomplishment of human obedience, whereby he fitted himself for priesthood. Before this he was the destined High Priest, but not the "perfected" High Priest, "ever living to make intercession for <span class="accented">us</span>." It is not during his life on earth, but after his exaltation, that he is spoken of as the High Priest of mankind. In his sufferings and death he was consecrated to his eternal office. This appears from vers. 9, 10, and also from <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>, quoted in this verse, where the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek and the exaltation to the right hand of God are regarded together. See also what was said under Hebrews 1:5, of the application to Christ of the other text quoted, "This day have I begotten thee." The Messianic reference and general drift of <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. has been considered under Hebrews 1:13. It was there seen to be more than a <span class="accented">typical</span> prophecy, David having in it a distinct view of One far greater than himself - of the Son to come, whom he calls his LORD. But even had it, like other Messianic psalms, a primary reference to some theocratic king, the remarkable import of ver. 4 would in itself point beyond one. For, though David organized and controlled the priesthood and the services of the sanctuary, though both he and Solomon took a prominent part in solemn acts of worship, yet neither they nor any other king assumed the priestly office, which, in its essential functions, was scrupulously confined to the sons of Aaron. The judgment on Uzziah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-22</a>) is a notable evidence of the importance attached to this principle. Yet the verse before us assigns a true priesthood to the future King. For Melchizedek, as he appears in Genesis, is evidently a true priest, though prior to the Aaronic priesthood, uniting in himself, according to the system of the patriarchal age, the royalty and the priesthood of his race: as a true priest, he blessed Abraham, and received tithes from him. But of him, historically and symbolically regarded, the consideration must be reserved for <a href="../../par/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>, where the subject is taken up. Enough here to observe that in <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>. a true and everlasting priesthood is assigned to the SON in union with his exalted royalty at the LORD'S right hand, and this by Divine appointment, by the "<span class="accented">voice"</span> or "<span class="accented">oracle"</span> of the Load (ver. 1), confirmed by the LORD'S oath (ver. 4).

This main intention of vers. 7, 8 must be kept in mind for a proper understanding of them. Christ is in them regarded, not as executing his priestly office, but as being prepared and consecrated for it. His eternal priesthood is conceived as entered on <span class="accented">after</span> the human experience which is the subject of these verses (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> (ver. 9), and what was said under ver. 5). With regard to the participial aorists, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, it is a misapprehension of their proper force to regard them as denoting a time <span class="accented">previous</span> to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 8; as if the meaning were - having in Gethsemane "offered," etc., and "been heard," he <span class="accented">afterwards</span> "learnt obedience" on the cross. All they express is that in offering, etc., and being heard, he learned obedience. The idea of subsequent time does not come in till ver. 9; "and being perfected," after thus learning obedience, "he became," etc. Thus the only question with regard to <span class="accented">time</span> in vers. 7, 8 is whether they have reference to the agony in the garden only, or both to the agony and the cross. That they refer mainly, if not exclusively, to the agony is evident from the expressions used, corresponding so closely with the Gospel history. The view presented is, as in the Gospels, of some intense inward struggle, outwardly manifested, and expressing itself in repeated prayers (observe the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) aloud for deliverance. It is true that the Gospels, as we have them now, do not mention <span class="accented">tears</span>; but these too are quite in keeping with the bloody sweat specified by St. Luke, and Epiphanius states that the original copies of <a href="../../par/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a> contained the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Some interpreters would identify <span class="accented">the</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span> of ver. 7 with the "loud voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>)" from the cross (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-34.htm">Mark 15:34</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>). But there is nothing to suggest this; the "strong crying and tears" evidently denote the manner of the "prayers and supplications;" and the thrice-repeated prayer in the garden recorded by the evangelists may be well conceived to have been thus loudly uttered, so as to be heard by the three <span class="accented">disciples</span>, a stone's cast distant, before sleep overcame them. "In cruce clamasse dicitur; lachrymasse non dicitur. Utrum horum respicit locum Gethsemane" (Bengel). What, then, as seen in the light of these verses, was the meaning of the "prayer and supplications" in the garden of Gethsemane? The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> of <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, confirms the view that the "cup" which he prayed might pass from him, was the death before him, and that the purport of his prayer was, not to be raised from death after undergoing it, but to be saved from undergoing it. Such is the ordinary meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in reference to one still alive (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/33-19.htm">Psalm 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-20.htm">James 5:20</a>). It does not indeed positively follow that, because he prayed to One who was able in this sense to save him, his prayer was that he might be in this sense saved. It is, however, the natural inference. But, if so, two difficulties present themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> How was such a prayer consistent with his distinct knowledge that death must be undergone, and his late strong rebuke to Peter for venturing to dissuade him from it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> How can he be said to have been <span class="accented">heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), since he was not saved from death in the sense intended? To the first of these questions the answer is that the prayer expressed, not the deliberate desire of his Divine will, but only the inevitable shrinking of the human will from such an ordeal as was before him. As man, he experienced this shrinking to the full, and as man he craved deliverance, though with entire submission to the will of the Father. His human will did not oppose itself to the Divine will: it conformed itself in the end entirely to it; but this according to the necessary conditions of humanity, through the power of prayer. Had it not been so with him, his participation in human nature would have been incomplete; he would not have been such as to be "touched with a feeling of our infirmities, being in all things tempted like as we are;" nor would he have stood forth for ever as the great Example to mankind. St. John, who so deeply enters into and interprets the mind of Christ, records an utterance before the agony which anticipates its meaning (<a href="../../par/john/12.htm">John 12</a>): "The hour is come" (ver. 23); and then (ver. 27), "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour [cf. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>]; but for this cause came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy Name." The "hour" was that of the drinking of the cup (cf. <a href="../../par/mark/14-35.htm">Mark 14:35</a>, "And prayed that, if it were possible, the <span class="accented">hour</span> might pass from him"). "Father, save me from this hour" was the human craving of the agony; but still, "Father, glorify thy Name" was the essence of the prayer; and perfect submission to the Divine will was the outcome of it, after this <span class="accented">troubling</span> of his human soul. The mystery surrounding the whole subject of the Divine and human in Christ remains still. What was said with regard to it about the temptation in the wilderness (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>) is applicable also here. If it be further asked how it was that Christ, in his humanity, so shrank from the "cup" before him, seeing that mere men have been found to face death calmly in its most appalling forms, the answer may be found in the consideration of what this cup implied. It was more than physical death, more than physical pain, more than any sorrow that falls to the lot of man.

Of the <span class="accented">second</span> difficulty mentioned above, as to how Christ was "heard," not having been saved "from death" in the apparent sense of his prayer, the solution may be that the prayer, conditioned as it was by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, was most truly answered by the angel sent to strengthen him, and the power thenceforth given him to "endure the cross, despising the shame." "Mortem ex qua Pater cum liberare posset, ne moreretur, tamen subiit, voluntati Patris obediens: ab horrore plane liberatus est per exauditionem Exauditus est, non ut ne biberet calicem, sed ut jam sine ullo horrore biberet: unde etiam per angelum corroboratus est" (Bengel). The example to us thus becomes the more apparent. For we, too, praying legitimately for release from excessive trial, may have our prayer best answered by grace given to endure the trial, and by "a happy issue" out of it; as was the case with Christ. For his bitter passion was made the path to eternal glory; and thus in the Resurrection too his prayer was answered. The exact meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is not easy to determine. It is taken by a large proportion of commentators to mean "deliverance from his fear;" <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> being supposed to be a <span class="accented">constructio praegnans</span> in the sense of "heard so as to be delivered," and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to denote the dread experienced in Gethsemane. So the old Italian Versions, and Ambrose, "exauditus a metu;" so Bengel, "ab hrr-rore liberatus per exauditlonem." This interpretation is upheld by Beza, Grotius, Tholuck, Hofmann, Ebrard, and many others; some of whom, less tenably (as Calvin, Hammond, Jackson), understand <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning, not the fear felt, but the thing feted: "ab eo quod timebat" (Calvin).

The objection to the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> to express the <span class="accented">cause</span> of his being heard is met by reference to the frequent usage of St. Luke, whose language most resembles that of our Epistle.

The phrase, thus understood, brings out the more markedly the thoroughly human conditions to which Christ was subjected. It was not in right of his sonship that he was heard. He won his hearing by his human piety; though he was SON, and as such knew that his Father heard him always (<a href="../../par/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>), he learnt humanly his lesson of obedience. In the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">Son</span> is surely meant in the peculiar sense in which it has all along been applied to Christ, expressing more than that his relation to God was that of <span class="accented">any</span> son to a father, and thus we perceive the full force of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>. It is true that it was not till after the Resurrection that he attained his exalted position as SON (see under Hebrews 1:5 and Hebrews 5:5); but still he was all along the Son, in virtue of his origin as well as of his destiny. Cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-9.htm">Hebrews 1:9</a>). <span class="greek">&#x3a9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> does not indeed, in itself, express that he was the Second Person of the Trinity (this application of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> being nowhere found in the Epistle); but it implies that, even in his state of humiliation, he was more than man; for there would be nothing very extraordinary, so as to justify <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>, in the case of an ordinary son learning obedience to his father through suffering. Recurring now to the question raised under ver. 3, whether the high priest's obligation to offer in the first place for himself had any counterpart in the case of Christ, we may perceive such a counterpart in the agony, as above regarded. For, although for himself Christ needed no atonement, yet the "prayers and supplications" were offered in his own behalf, being due to his own entire participation in the conditions of humanity; the whole "agony and bloody sweat" were part of his own preparation and consecration for executing the office of a High Priest for others, and, like the Aaronic priest's offering for himself, they were the sign and evidence of his being one <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> being all along understood) they answered truly to the preparatory part of Aaron's original consecration (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14 - 9:15</a>), or to the high priest's own offering, before his offering for the people and entering behind the veil, on the Day of Atonement (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>). It may be (though not necessarily so) that the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7, corresponding with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 3, is intended to suggest this analogy.

So also Hammond and Whitby. Being thus perfected, or consecrated, he became, for ever afterwards, the Author, not of mere ceremonial cleansing or temporary remission of guilt, but of eternal salvation; <span class="accented">potentially</span> to all mankind (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>), and <span class="accented">effectively to</span> "<span class="accented">all</span> them that obey him;" being addressed, in tiffs his consummated position (the reference being to <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) as "High Priest for ever," etc. Here again we perceive that it is not till after the Resurrection that the prophetic ideal of the SON at God's right hand, and of the eternal High Priest, are regarded as fully realized. If it be objected that his high priesthood must have begun <span class="accented">before</span> the Resurrection for his death upon the cross to be a true atonement, it may be replied that his one oblation of himself upon the cross at once consummated his consecration and effected the atonement. Doubtless, as a true High Priest on earth, he thus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>); all that is meant above is that it was not till after the Resurrection that he entered on his eternal office of mediation in virtue of that one accomplished sacrifice.

Even so far, we have seen how their Jewish prejudices had evoked admonitions, frequently interposed in the course of the argument.

Hence the writer's shrinking from entering all at once on the subject for fear of not being even understood; hence his earnest warnings to his readers as to the necessity of advancing to the state of full-grown Christians who can discern spiritual things. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11</span> - <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>. - INTERPOSED EXHORTATION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of whom</span> (the most obvious antecedent being Melchizedek, but with regard to his typical significance, as referred to in <a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">we have many things to say</span> (the subject itself admits a lengthy exposition) and hard of interpretation, seeing ye are become (not, as in A.V., "ye are") dull of hearing, Their dullness is the reason of the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. It was not that the subject was in itself inexplicable, or that the writer was incompetent to explain it; his difficulty was in adapting the interpretation to the capacity of his readers: "Non scribentis, sed vestro vitio" (Bengel). It seems from <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("ye are become"), in this and the following verse, that the Hebrew Christians had even retrograded in spiritual perception. This is easily conceivable. As, through the teaching of St. Paul especially, the tie between Christianity and Judaism became more and more broken, there was likely to be a certain reaction among the Hebrew Christians, who, having gone to a certain extent with the tide of thought, became conscious how far it was carrying them. They would be inclined to cling the more fondly to their old associations from the fear of losing them altogether. Such retrogressions have been observable in other times of upheaval of old ideas.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("oracles"), is used elsewhere for the revelations of the Old Testament, as <a href="../../par/acts/7-38.htm">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>. Here its meaning can hardly be taken as confined to them, since the first principles of the gospel are being spoken cf. Still, a word that includes them in its meaning may be purposely used by way of intimating that the elements intended are those of Judaism as well as Christianity, or of the latter only in its first emergence out of Judaism. And accordingly, vers. 1, 2 of <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>, where they are enumerated, are (as will be seen) so worded as to imply no more than this; nor are the first principles there mentioned beyond what an enlightened Jew might be expected to understand readily. Be it observed that the Hebrew Church need not be supposed to have actually lost sight of these first principles, so as to require a new indoctrination into them. There may be a vein of delicate irony in what is said, after the manner of St. Paul. All that is of necessity implied is that there had been such a failure in seeing what these principles led to as to suggest the necessity of their being learnt anew. The writer does not, in fact, as he goes on, require them to be learnt anew; for he bids his readers leave them behind, as though already known, and proceed from them to perfection, though still with some misgiving as to their capability for doing so. The figure of milk for babes and solid food for full-grown men, to illustrate the teaching suitable for neophytes and for advanced Christians, is found also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1, 2</a>; and that of <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>. This correspondence, though no proof of the Pauline authorship, is among the evidences of the Pauline character of the Epistle.

There is no need to suppose an exclusive reference to the more perfect doctrine in opposition to the elements, since, of the whole subject of religious knowledge, the <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may be said to be <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the sense of being without the matured skill that experience gives. Hence, too, we are certainly not justified in finding in the phrase a specific allusion to the Pauline doctrine of justification by faith only, which is not suggested by the context or by what follows. Still less may we (with Delitzsch) so ignore the notable significance of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as to reduce the expression to a synonym for "rightly framed, that is sound and orthodox discourse."

So, in the spiritual sphere, the mental faculties, exercised at first on simple truths, should acquire by practice the power of apprehending and distinguishing' between higher and more recondite ones. It was because the Hebrew Christians had failed thus to bring out their faculties that they were open to the charge of being still in a state of infancy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hebrews/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hebrews 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hebrews 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hebrews/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hebrews 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hebrews 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hebrews/6.htm"><title>Hebrews 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hebrews/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hebrews/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hebrews/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hebrews/5.htm" title="Hebrews 5">&#9668;</a> Hebrews 6 <a href="../hebrews/7.htm" title="Hebrews 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/6-1.htm">Hebrews 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore</span> (since it is so incumbent on us to advance out of the state of milk-fed infants), <span class="cmt_word">leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us press on unto perfection</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, continuing the image of maturity).

A further question is whether the writer merely expresses his own intention of proceeding at once in this Epistle to the more advanced doctrine, or whether he is exhorting his readers to make spiritual progress, using the first person plural, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> (as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-1.htm">Hebrews 2:1</a> and Hebrews 4:1, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) out of sympathetic courtesy. The correspondence of this delicate form of exhortation with that of the earlier passages, the very words <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">let</span> us be borne on," "press forward" (implying more than mere passing to a new line of thought), and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (which expresses personal maturity, not advanced subject of discourse), as well as the earnest warnings that follow against falling back, seem to <span class="accented">necessitate</span> the second of the above views of the meaning of this verse. The writer has, indeed, in his mind his intention of proceeding at once to the perfect doctrine; for he hopes that what he thus exhorts them to do they will do, so as to be able to follow him; but exhortation, rather than his own intention, is surely what the verse <span class="accented">expresses. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith towards God, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</span> What was meant by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, etc., and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., is here specified under the new image of a foundation on which a superstructure should be raised (cf. for the same figure, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>, a further instance of Pauline modes of thought). Of course no disparagement of the importance of this foundation is implied: it is necessary for the superstructure: it has in itself the elements of the superstructure, which rises from it in the way of growth. What is meant is, "With us this foundation has been already laid; I will not suppose any need for laying it anew: let us, then, go on to contemplate and understand the building that rests on and rises from it." The fundamentals enumerated are six - two essential principles of the religious life, and four heads of doctrine; for the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> rules <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and the three succeeding genitives, but not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> which precede. These are the fundamentals, or first principles, of Christianity; but (as has been intimated) so defined as to express no more, by the language used, than what even enlightened Jews might accept and understand. Fully understood, they carry the Christian superstructure; but they are such as a "babe" in Christ might rest content with; without seeing their ultimate bearing. The principles first mentioned are <span class="accented">repentance</span> and <span class="accented">faith</span>, the requisite qualifications for baptism, the essence of John the Baptist's teaching, and announced by Christ at the commencement of his ministry as the first steps into his kingdom: "The kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel" (<a href="../../par/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>). By the <span class="accented">dead</span> works, from which repentance is to be, the Fathers generally understand simply <span class="accented">sinful</span> works, which may be so called because of sin being a state of spiritual death, and having death for its wages (cf. "dead in trespasses and sins," <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>), or as being in themselves barren and fruitless (<span class="accented">cf.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>). In an enumeration of <span class="accented">elementary</span> principles like this, the allusion, supposed by some commentators, to the deadness of "the works of the Law," as set forth by St. Paul, is not likely to have been intended. The <span class="accented">faith</span> spoken of is not faith in Christ, but simply "faith towards God," which is, of course, the foundation and necessary preliminary of Christian faith. The reason for the expression is to be found in the writer's intention to specify only the first principles of the gospel, in which the Christian was still on common ground with the Jew (cf. <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>, "Ye believe in God, believe also in me"). The four fundamental <span class="accented">doctrines</span> follow. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Of</span> <span class="accented">baptisms.</span> Observe, the word is not <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, invariably used elsewhere for Christian baptism, but <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, and that in the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. In other passages <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> denotes the various lustrations practised by the Jews - "<span class="accented">washings</span> of pots and cups" (<a href="../../par/mark/7-8.htm">Mark 7:8</a>); "divers <span class="accented">washings</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>). Hence we may suppose these to be included in the general idea, and also the Jewish baptism of proselytes. On the other hand, the elementary doctrines of the gospel being here spoken of, there can be no doubt that the doctrine of Christian baptism is in the writer's view, but only with regard to the first simple conception of its recanting, which it had in common with other symbolical <span class="accented">washings</span>, the significance of which was understood by enlightened Jews (cf. <a href="../../par/john/3-10.htm">John 3:10</a>, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The doctrine of <span class="accented">laying on of hands.</span> This also was a Jewish rite, understood as signifying the bestowal of blessing and of power from above (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-13.htm">Mark 10:13</a>), and was, as well as baptism, adopted into the Christian Church, acquiring there a new potency. The apostles practiced it for conferring the gifts of the Spirit after baptism (<a href="../../par/acts/8-17.htm">Acts 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>), for ordination (<a href="../../par/acts/6-6.htm">Acts 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6</a>), and also for reconciling penitents (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>), and for healing' (<a href="../../par/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>). Mentioned here immediately after "the doctrine of baptisms," and in an enumeration of elements in which all Christians were concerned, we can hardly fail to understand special refer-once to the imposition of hands after baptism, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to confirmation. The two remaining doctrines of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the resurrection of the dead, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> eternal judgment, were also understood and generally accepted by enlightened Jews, and at the same time are necessary to be mentioned for a complete account of the foundations of the Christian faith. These foundations are, as has been seen - repentance and faith (qualifying for admission into the Church), and then the doctrine of remission of sins (expressed and conveyed by baptism), of enabling grace (expressed and conveyed by confirmation), of the life hereafter, and of final judgment. Of these an elementary conception was level to even babes in Christ, fresh from Jewish training; fully understood, they form the basis of the whole structure of the highest Christian doctrine. It is obvious from the purport of the passage why neither the historical articles of the creed in which Christians were instructed (see <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_corinthians/15-1.htm">1 Corinthians 15:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), nor the doctrine of the Eucharist (which belonged to the more advanced teaching), are included in this enumeration of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>.

The process intimated is that of complete apostasy from the faith after real conscious enjoyment of the gifts of grace. In such a case the hopelessness of the fall is in proportion to the privileges once enjoyed. This is the drift of the passage, though other views have been taken of its meaning, which will be noticed below. "Once enlightened" denotes the first apprehension of the light, which could be but once; when those that saw not began to see (<a href="../../par/john/5-39.htm">John 5:39</a>); when the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ shone once for all upon believers (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>); when (according to the cognate passage, <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-32.htm">Hebrews 10:32</a>) they received the knowledge of the truth. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means in the LXX." to enlighten by instruction," and was in common use in the early Church to express the enlightenment that accompanied baptism; whence baptism itself was called <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Thus Justin Martyr ('Apol.' 1:62) says, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> Cf. the title of Chrysostom's 'Hem.' 49, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Since the expression was thus commonly used as early as Justin Martyr, there may probably be in the text a special reference to baptism as the occasion of the enlightenment. But, if so, more is meant by the phrase than "those who have been once baptized:" an inward spiritual illumination is plainly pointed to; and it would not have been said of Simon Magus that he had been "once enlightened" in the sense intended. And this is indeed the real meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> as applied to baptism by Justin Martyr, as his explanation, above quoted, shows. So also Chrysostom ('Hem.' 116.), "The heretics have baptism, but not <span class="accented">enlightenment</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>); they are baptized indeed as to the body, but in the soul they are not <span class="accented">enlightened</span>; as also Simon was baptized, but was not enlightened." This consideration is important in view of one misapplication of the passage before us, which will be noticed below. But, further, those whom it is impossible to renew unto repentance are supposed not only to have been enlightened, but also to have "tasted of the heavenly gift," the emphatic word here being apparently <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>: they have had <span class="accented">experience</span> as well as knowledge (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>, "Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good;" and <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-3.htm">1 Peter 2:3</a>, "If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious"). The word "gift" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;</span>) is elsewhere used both for that of redemption generally (<a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-17</a>), and especially, and most frequently, for the gift of the Holy Ghost (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-15.htm">2 Corinthians 9:15</a>, "Thanks be to God for his unspeakable Gift"). They have become also <span class="accented">partakers</span> of the Holy Ghost, not merely been within the range of his influence, but actually shared it; and <span class="accented">tasted</span> (the same word as before, and with the same meaning, though here followed by an accusative) what is further spoken cf. The expression <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> occurs, <a href="../../par/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/23-15.htm">Joshua 23:15</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-13.htm">Zechariah 1:13</a>, for gracious Divine utterances. The idea of the Word of God being what is "tasted" may be suggested by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, quoted by our Lord in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proeeedeth out of the month of God." By the <span class="accented">powers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are to be especially understood (as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-4.htm">Hebrews 2:4</a> and elsewhere in the New Testament) the extraordinary ones in which the gift of the Holy Ghost was manifested, the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of the apostolic Church. But why said here to be <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>? For the meaning of this expression, see under <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>). It denotes the predicted age of the Messiah's triumph. And if (as has appeared most probable, and as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here seems evidently to imply) that age was regarded as still future, not properly beginning till the second advent, still the "powers" spoken of are of it, being earnests and foretastes of a new order of things (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-14.htm">Ephesians 1:14</a>, where the "Holy Spirit of promise" is called "the earnest of our inheritance;" also <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-22.htm">2 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>). There are other passages in which Christians are regarded as already in the dawn of the future daybreak, and irradiated by the coming glory. The <span class="accented">falling away</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) after such enlightenment and such experience means (as aforesaid) total apostasy from the faith. This appears from the expressions that follow, and still more from those in the cognate passage, <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-31</a>. "Non <span class="accented">relapses</span> mode dicit in pristina, sed nova pernicie <span class="accented">praeterlapsos a toto statu illo lautissimo, simulque a fide, spe, et amore"</span> (Bengel). Such an utter apostasy was possible to Hebrews oscillating between Church and synagogue: they might be so drawn at last into the atmosphere of the latter as, with the unbelieving Jews, to reject with contumely, and so to themselves recrucify, the Son of God. The force of "to themselves" is illustrated by <a href="../../par/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>, where St. Paul says that he so glories in the cross of Christ that through Christ the world is crucified to him, and he to the world; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all fellowship between him and the world is broken off. So here the <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> implies the breaking off of all fellowship with what a man is said to crucify. "They crucify again the Son of God, repeating what their fathers had done formerly when they gave him over to the death of the cross; and this, be it observed, still more culpably., since it is after personal experience proving him to be "the Son of God." And they not only make him as one dead to themselves: they also expose him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>, LXX.) to the reproach and mockery of the world. "Ostentantes, <span class="accented">scil</span> aliis" (Bengel). The above explanation is adopted from Delitzsch. Be it observed next what is said of those who do this - not that no repentance can henceforth avail them, but that even <span class="accented">unto repentance</span> it is impossible to renew them. Such falling away after such experience precludes the possibility of repentance. On such persons the powers of grace have been exhausted. It is not in the nature of things that they should return to Christ, or see the things that belong unto their peace any more. The correspondence between the state here described and the consequence of the "blasphemy against the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-31.htm">Matthew 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/3-28.htm">Mark 3:28</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-10.htm">Luke 12:10</a>) suggests itself at once; our Lord's words, in speaking of that unpardonable sin, being rightly supposed to point to obduracy in spite of experience of the Holy Spirit's power. Especially obvious is the correspondence with St. Luke's account of the Savior's warning - one of the not infrequent instances of resemblance between our Epistle and the writings of that evangelist. For St. Luke records the saying as spoken, not to the Jews on the occasion of their attributing Christ's works to Beelzebub, but to the disciples themselves, after a warning to them against "the leaven of the Pharisees," and against being moved by the fear of men, and immediately after the words, "He that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God." Compare also the "sin unto death" spoken of by St. John (<a href="../../par/1_john/5-16.htm">1 John 5:16</a>). Misconceptions of the drift of this passage, once prevalent, or possible, remain to be noticed. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It has been from early times a main support of the strict Church discipline according to which deadly sin committed after baptism precludes re-admission to Church communion. It was so cited by Tertullian as early as the second century ('De Pudicitia,' cf. 20), and in the third used to justify the Novatians in their refusal of communion, even after penance, to the <span class="accented">lapsi.</span> The passage, as above explained, was really irrelevant, since it refers, not to the treatment by the Church of penitents, but to the impossibility of some persons being brought to penitence at all. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Catholic Fathers, rightly rejecting the Novatian position, generally understood the text as forbidding the iteration of baptism; thus turning it against the Novatians, who rebaptized those who joined their communion. So Ambrose, Theodoret, and others. But, though their position on this subject was in itself sound, the passage, as above explained, is as irrelevant to it as to that of the Novatians. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> This, and the other texts referred to in connection with it, have led some Christians to despair of salvation, however anxious for it, under the idea that they had themselves committed the unpardonable sin. This desperate view goes beyond that of the Novatians, who only precluded from Church communion, not of necessity from the mercies of God (Socrates, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 4:21). But the very state of mind of those who entertain such fears is a sign that they are not of those to whom this text applies. They cannot have entirely fallen from grace, if they have the grace to repent and long for pardon. <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Calvin's predestinarian views compelled him and his followers to do violence to the plain meaning of the passage. Holding the doctrine of the <span class="accented">indefectibility</span> of grace, which involved <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that one really regenerate cannot fall away, and <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that consequently one who falls away cannot have been really regenerate, he had to explain away the clauses descriptive of the grace enjoyed, as meaning only a superficial experience of it. With this view he laid stress on the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> as meaning "summis labris gustare." Only dogmatic prejudice could have suggested such a sense of the word as intended in this place, any more than in <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-9.htm">Hebrews 2:9</a>, where it is plainly inadmissible. Nor can an impartial reader fail to see in the whole accumulation of pregnant clauses an intention of expressing the very reverse of a mere apparent and delusive experience of saving grace. The depth of the experience is, in fact, a measure of the hopelessness of the fall. Art. XVI. of the English Church is a protest against all the erroneous conclusions above specified. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers, 7, 8</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For land which hath drunk in the oft-coming rain upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whom</span> (not, as in A.V., "by whom") <span class="cmt_word">it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God; but if it beareth thorns and thistles</span> (not, as in A.V., "that <span class="accented">which</span> beareth"), <span class="cmt_word">it is rejected, and nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned</span> (literally, <span class="accented">for burning</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-15.htm">Isaiah 44:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The illustration is apt and close. Observe that the "land which hath drunk," etc., is the subject in ver. 8, as well as of ver. 7, as is shown by the absence of an article before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>. Hence the unproductive as well as the fruitful soil is supposed to have received, and not only received but imbibed also, abundant supplies of rain. Its failure is its own fault, and it is regarded as responsible for it, and deserving of its final fate. This exactly illustrates the case of those who "fall away" after not only receiving abundantly, but also taking in so as to be filled with the "gracious rain" of the Holy Spirit. The only difference is that in their case, free-will being a constituent of their productive power, the responsibility figuratively attributed to the land is real (cf. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26</a>). For similar illustrations drawn from unproductiveness in nature in spite of culture, <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a> and <a href="../../par/luke/20-23.htm">Luke 20:23</a>. The "blessing from God" refers to the view, pervading the Old Testament, of fruitfulness being the result and sign of the Divine blessing on the land (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/27-27.htm">Genesis 27:27</a>, "The smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord hath blessed"). And it is further implied that incipient fruitfulness is rewarded by more abundant blessing, according to our Lord's words, <a href="../../par/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>, "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given," and <a href="../../par/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>, "Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit." The "thorns and thistles," connected with a curse on the ground, seem suggested by <a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17, 18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. LXX. (cf. "Cursed shall be the fruit of thy land," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-18.htm">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>). It is to be observed, further, that the land, though bearing thorns instead of fruit, is not spoken of as yet under the final curse, but only nigh unto it, so as to avoid even a remote suggestion that the Hebrew Christians had actually reached the hopeless state. <span class="accented">But</span>, unless fruitfulness should ensue, they are warned of the inevitable end by the fate of thorns and thistles, which is, not to be garnered, but to be burnt (cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away.... and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place;" cf. also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth thereon"  - a state of final hopeless barrenness).

The reason for not only a hope, but even a persuasion, that God will keep them from apostasy, is given in the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">For God <i>is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in the Textus Receptus is ill supported, having, perhaps, been interpolated kern <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>) <span class="cmt_word">which ye showed towards his Name, in that ye ministered to the saints, and do minister</span>. It appears that the Hebrew Christians had formerly (some especial occasion being probably referred to) been active in their charity towards fellow-Christians in distress, and that such charity had not ceased. On this is grounded the persuasion that they will be kept steadfast in the faith. Those who had so shown their faith by their works would surely not be allowed to lose it. The very idea of the Divine justice implies that the use of grace, thus evidenced, will be rewarded by continuance of grace. Cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perfect it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) until the day of Jesus Christ; "where also there is reference to deeds of charity, shown in the case of the Philippians by their sympathy with the apostle in his bonds, which charity he prays may "abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all discernment." No difficulty need be felt in this reference to God's justice, as though it involved the doctrine of human merit, <span class="accented">de congruo</span> or <span class="accented">de condigno</span>, claiming reward as of debt. The simple and obvious view, that God, in virtue of his justice, will be most gracious to those who have used his grace, by no means contravenes the doctrine of all grace being the free gift of his bounty (cf. <a href="../../par/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, etc.). Observe, too, as bearing on the idea of this passage, how the will to <span class="accented">do</span> the will of God is said by our Lord to be followed by knowledge of the <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (<a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>), and how works of charity are the very tests of the final judgment (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, etc.).

Abraham being presently adduced as an example, it refits to all who at any time so inherit, equivalent to, "the inheritors of." The drift is - Faith and patience are ever required in order that the Divine promises, however assured, may be inherited: these qualifications (in opposition to your being <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) are what you want for securing your own inheritance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13</a></div><div class="verse">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. And so</span>, <span class="accented">having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</span> Abraham - the ancestor of the Hebrews, the first recipient of the promises, the father of the faithful - is now appropriately adduced as an example. He (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>), as is the case with you (<a href="../../par/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110</a>.), was assured of his inheritance by the Divine oath; and so he obtained it, but only through "faith and patience." You have the like assurance, but attended with the like conditions. And then this Divine oath, the significance of which is set forth in vers. 16-18, is made a link of connection between the hortatory section (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11-6:20</a>) and the coming argument about Melchizedek. This is one instance of the artistic way in which, throughout the Epistle, the interposed hortatory passages are so turned as to connect the divided sections of the argument. But what is said about Abraham (vers. 13, 14, 15) has been variously understood. It is connected with ver. 12 thus: "<span class="accented">Be</span> ye followers of them who inherit the promises through faith and patience: <span class="accented">for</span> God, in his promise to Abraham, swore by himself in confirmation of it; <span class="accented">and so</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) through patience he obtained the promise. Be it here observed that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 15 ("having patiently endured," A.V.) corresponds with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 12, and expresses essentially the same idea. The aorist participle <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> does not in itself imply that the patience was previous to the obtaining; it expresses only that by patiently enduring he obtained. Observe also that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-44.htm">Acts 27:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-14.htm">Acts 28:14</a>) denotes the <span class="accented">consequence</span> from what has been previously stated; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> followed from the Divine oath ensuring the fulfillment of the promise. Both his eventually obtaining and his patience in awaiting fulfillment were in consequence of the assuring oath. But then how and when did Abraham himself obtain the promise? Not even the temporal fulfillment in the multiplication of his seed and the inheritance of the Promised Land, much less the spiritual fulfillment in Christ, was during his own life. Both he could but see "afar <span class="accented">off."</span> In respect to the latter it is expressly said (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13, 39</a>) that the patriarchs did <span class="accented">not</span> receive the promises - <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>.

Bleek understands the time of the oath (<a href="../../par/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.), when the promise was irrevocably assured, to have been the time of obtaining. But more than this is suggested by the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (cf. <span class="accented">Hebrews</span> 11:33), as well as by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, viz. the actual attainment of the blessing assured to him by oath. There are two other ways of explaining: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to identify Abraham with his seed, in whom, though not in his own person, he may be conceived to have obtained, - of which view it may be significant that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> of the LXX. (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) is changed in the Epistle to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to regard Abraham, still alive in the unseen world, as himself enjoying the fulfillment of the ancient promise. So Delitzsch, who, dwelling on the thought that nothing less than the blessing of Abraham extended to the whole world (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="../../par/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13</a>) can be regarded as complete fulfill-merit, says, "God's oath-sealed word of promise is now fulfilled in Christ, and Abraham, while living on in the unseen world, is conscious of and enjoys that fulfillment, and so may be said to have "obtained the promise." This view derives some support from <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13-16</a>, where the longings of the pilgrim patriarchs is so beautifully represented as reaching to a heavenly fulfillment. On the other hand, the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> is against it, and hence view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> may be accepted as a sufficient explanation of the expression (see below, or <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>). With regard to the general drift, it is obvious how <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, in respect to the promise first made to him "in Charran," is strikingly displayed in Abraham's recorded life.

Here begins the explanation of the meaning and purpose of the Divine oath, already cursorily touched on in ver. 13. God thus, for full assurance, condescends to the form of confirmation most binding among men when they promise to each other. <span class="accented">They</span> appeal to one greater than themselves to intervene between <span class="accented">them. He</span>, having no one greater than himself to appeal to, appeals (so to speak) to his own immutability, and thus may be said to <span class="accented">intervene</span> with an oath (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;</span> ever. 17), the verb being neuter, with the sense of "mediate" or "intervene," not, as in A.V., "confirmed it". The reason is not that the Divine promise is not in itself enough, but that <span class="cmt_word">God, willing to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel</span>, is pleased to grant them this additional confirmation; that by two immutable things (first the promise, in itself sufficient; and secondly the oath, for more abundant <span class="accented">assurance</span>), in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong consolation (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, bearing elsewhere this sense, and also that of <span class="accented">exhortation</span>, as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-22.htm">Hebrews 13:22</a>; which latter sense is understood here by most commentators as uniting best the drift of the passage with the general notion of encouragement) who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us. The course of thought has now passed again from Abraham to Christians, the transition having been prepared for by the general expression, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 17. Indeed, the oath to him was an assurance to us also, we being the final inheritors of the promised blessing. Then finally, in the two concluding verses, the subject to be treated in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7.htm">Hebrews 7</a>. is again beautifully led up to by a natural sequence of thought: Which (<span class="accented">so.</span> hope) we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into that which is within the veil; whither as a Forerunner Jesus entered for us, become a High Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. Our hope (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>), regarded in ver. 18 objectively, assumes here a subjective sense: it is our anchor east upwards beyond the heavens through which our Forerunner has passed (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), and, in virtue of the promise and the oath, fixed there secure and firm. "That which is within the <span class="accented">veil"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the word invariably denoting the veil in the temple, is the heavenly holy of holies, of which the earthly was symbolical, as is fully set forth in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8</a>. This first mention of the veil is an instance of the manner in which, throughout this Epistle, ideas to be afterwards expanded are often intimated by way of preparation beforehand. Instructive in this chapter is the view presented of Divine purpose in relation to human will. The Divine purpose may have been evinced by supplies of grace so abundant as to remove all doubt of the possibility of success; yet through the human will there may be failure: the very Divine oath may have ensured fulfillment of the promise; yet, as to Abraham, so to individual Christians, faith and patience are the conditions of fulfillment. It is evident that the Divine purpose and the Divine promise are all along referred to, not to dishearten any for fear that they may not be included in them, not to encourage remissness in any on the ground of certainty of attainment, not so as to suggest any idea of arbitrary selection irrespective of desert, but simply to incite to perseverance on the ground of assurance of success, if the human conditions are fulfilled. And this is the practical application of the doctrine of predestination found also elsewhere in St. Paul's Epistles (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28-39</a>). Predestination and free-will may be to human reason theoretically irreconcilable, though reason, as well as theology, may compel us to acknowledge both. The problem may properly be left unsolved, as among the many deep things of God. But it is of importance to observe how the doctrine of-predestination is practically applied in Scripture as bearing upon human conduct. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span> It is this language especially that has been supposed to involve something more than human about the historical Melchizedek. But we have only to enter into the mind of the writer to see that it is not so. For it is the ideal of the psalm, conceived as suggested by the historical type, that gives its color to the language used. And, indeed, how strangely suggestive is that fragment about the priestly king (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-21</a>) so unexpectedly interposed in the life of Abraham! In the midst of a history in which such a point is made of the parentage and descent of the patriarchs of Israel, at a time of peculiar glory of the first and greatest of them, one suddenly appears on the scene, a priest and king, not of the peculiar race at all, his parentage and ancestry unrecorded and unknown, who blesses and receives tithes from Abraham, and then as suddenly disappears from view. We hear no more of him; as about his origin, so about his end, Scripture is silent. And so he "abides" before the mind's eye, apart from any before or after, the type of an unchanging priesthood. For the meaning of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in itself denoting the absence, not of ancestors, but of a traced genealogy), cf. ver. 6, 6 <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

On "made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) unto the Son of God," Chrysostom says, "We know of no beginning or end in either case; in the one, because none are recorded; in the other, because they do not exist." The idea seems to be that Melchizedek is thus assimilated to Christ in the sacred record, by what it leaves untold no less than by what it tells. It is not said that he is like him (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), but made like (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> represented in such wise as to resemble him. It may be here remarked that, though the term "Son of God" is used in the Epistle generally to denote the Messiah as manifested in time, his essential eternal being is here, as elsewhere, distinctly intimated; also that "the Son of God" is regarded as the archetype of the comparison: "Non dicitur Filius DEI assimilatus Melchizedeko, sed contra; nam Filius DEI est antiquior et archetypus" (Bengel).

The typical significance of Melchizedek is now further seen in what passed between him and Abraham, in respect to tithe and blessing. Alford's inference, that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, referring as it does, not to the antitype, but to the man himself, implies some mysterious greatness beyond what appears in the original record, does not follow. Of one who simply blessed and received tithes from the great patriarch, the expression is not too strong. Observe the emphatic position, at the end of the Greek sentence, of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to "he, the patriarch." Abraham's being this, the father and representative of the chosen race, is what is shown in what follows to give peculiar significance to the transaction. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> (properly, "the chief spoils"), which is not in the LXX., seems introduced to enhance the picture: "Quae Abrahami proprie fuerant, ut victoris" (Bengel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-5.htm">Hebrews 7:5</a></div><div class="verse">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they indeed of the song of Levi who receive the office of priesthood have commandment to receive tithes of the people according to the Law, that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the loins of Abraham: but he whose genealogy is not counted from them hath received tithes of Abraham</span>. As much as to say, "Let it not be said that the tithing of Abraham by Melchizedek implies no higher priestly prerogative than the tithing of Abraham's descendants by the sons of Aaron; for there is this difference: They, in virtue only of a special ordinance of the Law, not of original right, were allowed to tithe their brethren, though descended from the same great ancestor; he, though not of them or of the race at all, in virtue of his own inherent dignity, tithes the whole race as represented in its patriarch." (We observe how, in place of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, used when the mere historical incident was referred to, we have here the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> (as also <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> in what follows, and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in ver. 9), denoting a completed act, of which the effects and significance remain; Melchizedek, who represents the priesthood after his order, being viewed in permanent relation to Abraham, who represents the chosen race.) And hath blessed him that hath (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the holder of) the promises. But, without all controversy, the less is blessed of the better. The superiority evidenced by bestowal of blessing no less than by receiving of tithe having been thus noticed, the contrast with the Levitical priesthood is continued in the following verses.

The difference here noted is between a succession of mortal priests and one perpetually living, who never loses his personal claim, which is inherent, in himself. But how so of Melchizedek? For it is to him, and not to Christ the Antitype, that the words evidently apply. Is it at length implied that he was more than mortal man? No, if only for this reason; that the witness appealed to (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) must be that of Scripture, which nowhere bears such witness of the historical Melchizedek. The words, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span>, are, in fact, only a resumption of what was said in ver. 3: "having neither beginning of days nor end of life;" and hear the same meaning; viz. (as above explained) that he passes before our view in Genesis with no mention of either death, birth, or ancestry, and thus presented the ideal of "a priest for ever" to the inspired psalmist. The witness referred to is that of the record in Genesis, viewed in the light of the idea of the psalm. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/7-9.htm">Hebrews 7:9</a></div><div class="verse">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth tithes, hath paid tithes.</span> <span class="cmt_word">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchizedek met him.</span> Or, in other words, "Nay, further, Melchizedek may be said to have tithed Levi himself and his priestly tribe." For, inasmuch as the whole position of Levi and his tribe, in the old dispensation, came by inheritance from the great patriarch who received the promises, the subordination of the patriarch to one above himself involved that of all who so inherited, it is not simply the physical descent of Levi from Abraham, but the peculiar position of the latter as "the patriarch," that justifies the assertion that Levi paid tithes through him. And thus, while we remember how Abraham is elsewhere viewed in Scripture as the representative of the chosen people, and also how the lives of individual patriarchs (notably so in the case of Jacob and Esau) are so told and referred to as to prefigure the positions and fortunes of the races they represent, we may recognize in this assertion no mere rabbinical fancy, but an interpretation true to the spirit of the Old Testament. Be it further observed that the original significance of Abraham's action as bearing upon his descendants is enhanced by the fact that, while it was <span class="accented">after</span> the receiving of the promise, it was <span class="accented">before</span> the birth of Isaac. He, and consequently his descendant Levi, was yet (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) in the loins of Abraham; on which point, "Proles e parenlis poteslate egressa in suam venit tutelain: sod quoad in parentis potestate, imo in lumbis est, illius conditionem sequitur" (Bengel).

So far the superiority of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek to the Aaronic has been shown. The new thought is that the very mention in the psalm of a different order of priesthood implies that the old order, and with it the whole legal dispensation which depended on it, was imperfect and to be superseded. This is the general drift of vers. 11, 12, though the sequence of thought in their several clauses is not easy to follow. Ideas in the writer's mind, not expressed, seem necessary to be understood. In the parenthetical clause of ver. 11, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are decidedly to be preferred, on the ground of authority, to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> of the Textus Receptus. 'The meaning of the clause (whatever be the precise thought connecting it with the sentence in which it stands) is that the whole Law rested on the institution of the priesthood; not the priests only, but the whole people (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), received their Law as grounded on it. On the same idea depends ver. 12, where it is said that a change of the priesthood involves of necessity a change of the Law. The verses next following serve to remove all doubt that there <span class="accented">is</span> a complete change of the priesthood; the proofs being, not only the patent fact that the Messiah is of the tribe, not of Levi, but of Judah (vers. 13, 14), but also, for mere abundant evidence of the Divine purpose, that significant utterance, again adduced, about his being after the order, not of Aaron, but of Melchizedek (vers. 15, 16, 17).

For it is to Christian believers, with whatever Jewish prejudices, not to unbelieving Jews, that the Epistle is addressed. It is important to observe that the Davidic descent of our Lord is spoken of as an acknowledged fact, not merely as an inference from prophecy. "We have here a most significant proof that the descent of Jesus from the tribe of Judah was a well and universally known fact before the destruction of Jerusalem" (Ebrard).

But two proofs are first to be given of Christ's priesthood being, unlike the Aaronic, thus eternally availing to bring us near to God. These proofs are to be found in the Divine oath which established it, and the expression, "forever," in <a href="../../par/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>, once more adduced.

(Observe the first occurrence here of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, introducing in the way of hint (as is usual in the Epistle) an idea to be afterwards expanded, as it is in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8.htm">Hebrews 8</a>. and 9.

The repetitions are not tautological, having each time different bearings. The contrast here, as before, is between mortal men who succeed each other in the office of priesthood, and One who has the office inherent in himself forever. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (translated "unchangeable") is taken by some in an intransitive sense, as in margin of the A.V., <span class="accented">that doth not pass to another</span>, equivalent <span class="accented">to</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Here it is the perpetual intercession of Christ before the heavenly mercy-seat. In the view of his office thus arrived at there is, in fact, a transition to the main subject set forth in the three chapters that follow; viz. the fulfillment in Christ of the ceremonial of the Law, and especially of the high priest's intercession on the Day of Atonement. And thus from Melchizedek the train of thought passes to the high priest. The type of the former has been sufficiently shown to be fulfilled in the <span class="accented">higher order</span> of Christ's priesthood; it is now to be shown how, being of such higher order, it is the antitype of the Aaronic priesthood too, accomplishing what it signified. Hence in ver. 26 the word "high priest" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) is for the first time introduced, as the key-note of what is coming. <span class="accented">Summary of the foregoing argument.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="cmt_subheading">I.</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-11</a>.)

It was there said that to make the Captain of our salvation perfect through suffering "became" God - was befitting to what we conceive of the Divine nature. It is now said that our High Priest's being such as is here described "became" us - was befitting to our state and needs. That he should be both human and superhuman was in all respects fitting - the one that he might be our sympathizing brother; the other that his intercession might avail. The further description of him in this verse is suggested by the qualifications of the Aaronic high priest, what they typified being realized in Christ.

This view is supported by the fact that the <span class="accented">daily</span> sacrifices are not spoken of in the Law as including a special one in the first place for the priest's own sin. "This he did." Did what? Offer for his own sins as well as for the people's? No; for, though it has been seen above (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) how the high priest's offering for himself might have its counterpart in the agony, the Sinless One cannot be said to have offered for sins of his own.

But what is the <span class="accented">true</span> tabernacle, in which Christ ministers? Are we to suppose that an actual prototype of the earthly tabernacle is regarded as existing locally beyond the sky? No; it is only implied that there are, in the suprasensuous sphere, facts and relations which are symbolized and made level to our comprehension by local imagery. Still, there may be conceived as present to the writer's mind an ideal picture of a heavenly temple, such as was seen in vision by prophets, and served to aid their conception of realities beyond their ken. Thus in <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>, where the thunderstorm is described, the LORD is conceived, in the introductory and concluding verses, as enthroned above it in his heavenly temple, sitting there a King for ever, and worshipped by the "sons of God." Thus in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a> Michaiah sees in vision "the Loud sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him, on his right hand and on his left." In <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. this throne is seen as the distinct counterpart of the mercy-seat in the earthly temple, with the winged forms above it, and the "house" filled with the smoke of incense, and live coals upon the altar. Ezekiel's still more remarkable visions (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1, 10, 11</a>.) are in like manner enlargements of the idea of the Shechinah in the holy of holies (cf. also <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/2.htm">Hebrews 2</a>:20). Then the visions of St. John in the Revelation have the same basis; there is still seen a glorious counterpart above of the temple below; though now with new accessories, expressive of accomplished redemption. But that St. John's visions are meant only as imagery representing the incomprehensible is evident throughout, and especially from the ideal description of the holy city in <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>, in which ver. 22 is peculiarly significant: "And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it." In the same way is to be understood the "true tabernacle." If, as we may suppose, the writer had before his mind the prophetic visions of such a heavenly temple, he entertains them only as imaging spiritual facts and relations in the regions of eternity. "Which the Lord pitched," etc., may have reference to <a href="../../par/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.

He has been shown to be a High Priest: therefore he must make some offering, this being the very purpose of a high priest's office (cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>). But where? Not certainly in the earthly tabernacle, this being served already, and exclusively served, by the sons of Aaron. Therefore it must be in the heavenly sphere symbolized by the earthly tabernacle. And then, in ver. 5, that there <span class="accented">is</span> a heavenly reality, of which the earthly tabernacle is but a shadow, is shown by what was said of the latter when it was made. (What Christ offers in the heavenly sphere is surely his own atoning sacrifice. Some commentators have found a difficulty in this conception on the ground that this his sacrifice had been completed once for all before his ascension. True; but he is regarded as carrying its efficacy with him to the mercy-seat above, and so for ever offering it; even as it is continually commemorated and pleaded in the Eucharist by the Church below. And thus, be it observed, the symbolism of the Day of Atonement is accurately fulfilled. For the high priest did not sacrifice within the tabernacle; he only carried to the holy of holies the blood, representing the atoning efficacy of the sacrifice made outside before his entrance.)

The reference here is to <a href="../../par/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; the words which "the LORD spake unto Moses." Rabbinical writers, holding the view of an actual heavenly tabernacle, the prototype of the earthly one, have concluded from the passage in Exodus that Moses had a vision of it, or that a visible representation of it was exhibited to him on the mount. All that is necessarily implied is that he was divinely admonished to make the tabernacle after the fashion conveyed, in whatever way, to his apprehension when on the mount, so that it might be a true representation of some heavenly reality (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>).

There the proved superior greatness of the predicted priest was made the measure of the superior excellence of the <span class="accented">covenant</span> of which he has become Surety; here the superior excellence of the new <span class="accented">covenant</span>, which is now to be shown from prophecy, is made /he measure of that of Christ's priestly ministry, which has just been proved to be of necessity in the sphere of heavenly realities of which the Mosaic ritual was but a copy and shadow. The word here used is not <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ("surety"), as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-22.htm">Hebrews 7:22</a>, but <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> ("mediator"); on which it is to be observed that the mediator of the old covenant was not Aaron, but Moses (see <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>): it was he that intervened between God and the congregation in the establishment of the covenant; and thus, in this respect also, the priesthood of the new covenant transcends the old one, in that (as was shown also in the earlier part of the Epistle) the type of Moses, as well as of Aaron, is fulfilled in it. The word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> ("established" in A.V.; "enacted" in the recent R.V.) expresses the promulgation of a <span class="accented">law - appositely</span> in the first place to the Law of Moses, which constituted the conditions of the old covenant; but also to the description of the new covenant, which follows from Jeremiah, according to which the <span class="accented">law</span> remains, but to be written on the heart. The gospel is elsewhere regarded under the idea of <span class="accented">law</span>, though not a law of bondage, but of liberty - a law, not of the letter, but of the Spirit (see <a href="../../par/romans/3-27.htm">Romans 3:27</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-2.htm">Romans 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-31.htm">Romans 9:31</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>). The "better promises" are such as the passage from Jeremiah, quoted below, notably represents. Other passages might be referred to (such as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, etc.; Ezekiel 37:24, etc.), of similar significance, though not with the same marked mention of a new <span class="accented">covenant</span> to supersede the old one. This memorable passage (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-35</a>) occurs in a distinct section of Jeremiah's prophecies (30, 31.), delivered after the commencement of the Captivity, and directed to be written in a book. The subject of the whole section is the restoration of Israel, its ultimate Messianic reference being patent to all who acknowledge any such at all in prophecy. In evidence of this there is not only the passage before us, pointing to an entirely new covenant with Israel, and the ideal tone of the whole prophecy, but also, in particular, the view of all the scattered tribes, not Judah only - the whole ideal Israel - being gathered together from all countries to Zion, and of David himself to rule over them as king. The national and local framework, which the picture has in common with other prophetic visions of the coming days, is of course no difficulty to those familiar with the style of the prophetic books. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/8-7.htm">Hebrews 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for a second</span>. "For" introduces this sentence as a reason for what has been already said; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for a <span class="accented">better</span> covenant having been spoken cf. The expression might be objected to by Hebrew readers as implying imperfection in the original Divine covenant. "Nay," says the writer, "it <span class="accented">was</span> imperfect, it was <span class="accented">not</span> faultless; for prophecy itself declares this." Should it be further objected that in the prophecy it is not the old covenant itself that is found fault with, but the people for not observing it, the answer would be that the remedy for their non-observance being the substitution of a new one that would answer its purpose better, some imperfection in the old one is implied. This is indeed the very point of this verse. If it be asked, further, how faultiness in the old covenant is compatible with the view of its Divine origin, the answer is abundantly supplied in St. Paul's Epistles. His position constantly is that the Mosaic Law, though in itself "holy, just, and true," and adequate to its purpose, was still imperfect as a means of justification. It was but a temporary dispensation, with a purpose of its own, intervening between the original promise to Abraham and the fulfillment of that promise in Christ. Thus it is no derogation to itself or to its Author to charge it with "weakness and unprofitableness" for a purpose it was never meant to answer.

For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people: and they shall not teach every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

The LXX., followed in the text, gives the more probable meaning.

It is important to perceive that this last characteristic of the new covenant, though coming last in order, is given as the reason for the other two; for this is a first principle of the gospel. The sense of forgiveness through Christ, of acceptance in the Beloved, is ever set forth as the inspiring principle of the obedience of Christians. "We love him, because he first loved <span class="accented">us."</span> And hence flow the two results denoted in the prophecy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "I will put my laws," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there will ensue, through the inspiring Spirit, from the sense of forgiveness in Christ, a hearty service of love and loyalty; no mere mechanical observance of an external code. Then, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "And they shall not <span class="accented">teach</span>," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those who thus, led by the Spirit, give themselves to such hearty service, will acquire, further, an immediate, and as it were instinctive, "knowledge of the Lord," not confined to "the wise" or "<span class="accented">the</span> scribe," but the personal privilege of even the "little ones" of Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes;" also <a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>, "<span class="accented">It</span> is written in the prophets, And they shall be <span class="accented">all</span> taught of God;" also <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>, "But as touching brotherly love, ye need not that I write unto you; for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another;" also <a href="../../par/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>, "But ye have an unction kern the Holy One, and ye know all things"). It is not to be inferred (as has been) from this last result that a distinct order of ministry is no essential constituent of the Christian Church for admonition of others. The fact that such a ministry was constituted from the first in all the Churches, and was in active operation when apostles wrote as above, is in itself sufficient disproof of such a view. All that is implied is that <span class="accented">all</span> faithful believers, small as well as great (using, of course, the means of grace and edification provided for them in the Church), should themselves have inward illumination and personal communion with God. This is indeed a peculiar glory of the Christian religion. The poorest and the simplest believer may have spiritual perceptions and spiritual experience of his own, surpassing those of his appointed guides, and remaining his own though priests and teachers be unfaithful. "I am small and despised" (may the Christian, still more than the ancient psalmist, say), "yet do not I forget thy precepts." "I have more understanding than all my teachers; for thy testimonies are my meditation." Observe, lastly, the ideality of the whole view given of the effects of the new covenant. It presents to us the purpose, the potentiality, of the new dispensation, rather than results to be fully realized in this world; though still actually realized so far as the "glorious light of the gospel" illuminates the Church, and is allowed to "shine into" the human heart. This remark applies to all Messianic prophecy.

The very mention of a new covenant had even then antiquated the other. It thenceforth survived only under the category of <span class="accented">old</span> as opposed to <span class="accented">new</span>; and further marked with the growing decrepitude which is the precursor of dissolution. This further idea is expressed by the present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (elsewhere applied to garments that are wearing out; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/102-27.htm">Psalm 102:27</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-11.htm">Hebrews 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-6.htm">Isaiah 51:6</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>), and also by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a figure taken from the advance of old age in men. When the Epistle was written, it would not have been spoken of as "waxing old," but as defunct. The temple, indeed, was still standing, with the old ritual going on; but it had become but as the stately shrine of a lifeless thing. As to the view of the antiquation having begun even in the prophetic age, we observe that the prophets themselves show a consciousness of this, in that their growing tendency is to depreciate rather than exalt the ceremonial Law, and to put mercy above sacrifice. In fact, the Old Testament itself, especially in its later parts, is replete with the principles of the new covenant, anticipated in part, though not to be fully revealed till Christ appeared. And so, when he did appear, the old dispensation had already become obsolete, and the new one prepared for; to be rejected in Israel by those only who, "in the reading of the Old Testament," had "the veil upon their heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../hebrews/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Hebrews 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hebrews 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hebrews/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hebrews 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hebrews 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/hebrews/9.htm"><title>Hebrews 9 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/hebrews/9.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/hebrews/9.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/hebrews/9-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../hebrews/8.htm" title="Hebrews 8">&#9668;</a> Hebrews 9 <a href="../hebrews/10.htm" title="Hebrews 10">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/9-1.htm">Hebrews 9:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then verily the first <i>covenant</i> had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then verily</span> (or, <span class="accented">now indeed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the first covenant also</span> (or, <span class="accented">even the first covenant</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>had ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary</span> (rather <span class="accented">its sanctuary of this world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a></div><div class="verse">For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein <i>was</i> the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbead; which is called the holy place.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the holy of holies; having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid with gold, wherein was a golden pot having the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; and over it the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak particularly.</span> The tabernacle as a whole is first spoken of; and then its two divisions, called respectively "the first 'and "the second" tabernacle. The account of them is from the Pentateuch, and describes them as they originally were. In the then existing temple there were neither ark, mercy-seat, nor cherubim, though the ceremonies were continued as though they had been still there. The ark had been removed or destroyed in the sack by the Chaldeans, and was never replaced (for the Jewish tradition on the subject, see 2 Macc. 2:1-8). Josephus says ('Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. 5) that in the temple of his day there was nothing whatever behind the veil in the holy of holies; and Tacitus informs us ('Hist.,' v 9) that, when Pompey entered the temple, he found there "vacuam sedem et inania arcana." A stone basement is said by the rabbis to have occupied the ark's place, called "lapis fundationis." In the "first tabernacle," called "the holy place" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> probably, not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a neuter plural, equivalent to "the holies"), the table of shewbread (with its twelve loaves in two rows, changed weekly) stood on the north side, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the right as one approached the veil; and opposite to it, on the left, the seven-branched golden candlestick, or lamp-stand, carrying an oil-lamp on each branch (<a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 37, 40</a>.). Between them, close to the veil stood the golden altar of incense (ibid.); which, nevertheless, is not mentioned here as part of the furniture of the "first tabernacle," being associated with the "second," for reasons which will be seen. The "second veil" was that between the holy place and the holy of holies (<a href="../../par/exodus/36-35.htm">Exodus 36:35</a>), the curtain at the entrance of the holy place (<a href="../../par/exodus/36-37.htm">Exodus 36:37</a>) being regarded as the first. The inner sanctuary behind this second veil is spoken of as <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) in the first place "a golden <span class="accented">censer</span>," as the word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is translated in the A.V. (so also in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">thuribulum</span>). But it assuredly means the" golden altar of incense," though this stood locally outside the veil. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> otherwise there would be no mention at all of this altar, which was so important in the symbolism of the tabernacle, and so prominent in the Pentateuch, from which the whole description is taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The alternative view of its being a censer reserved for the use of the high priest, when he entered behind the veil on the Day of Atonement, has no support from the Pentateuch, in which no such censer is mentioned as part of the standing furniture of the tabernacle, and none of <span class="accented">gold is</span> spoken of at all; nor, had it been so, would it have been placed, any more than the altar of incense, <span class="accented">within</span> the veil, since the high priest required it <span class="accented">before</span> he entered. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Though the word itself, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, certainly means" censer," and not "altar of incense," in the LXX., yet in the Hellenistic writers it is otherwise. Philo and Josephus, and also Clemens Alexandrinus and Origen, always call the altar of incense <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>; and the language of the Epistle is Hellenistic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The wording does not of necessity imply that what is spoken of was locally <span class="accented">within</span> the veil: it is not said (as where the actual <span class="accented">contents</span> of the "first tabernacle" and of the ark are spoken <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented">wherein</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>), but <span class="accented">having</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>), which need only mean <span class="accented">having as belonging to it</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> connected with its symbolism. It was an appendage to the holy of holies, though not actually inside it, in the same way (to use a homely illustration given by Delitzsch) as the sign-board of a shop belongs to the shop and not to the street. It is, indeed, so regarded in the Old Testament. See <a href="../../par/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony;" also <a href="../../par/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, "Before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony;" and <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-22.htm">1 Kings 6:22</a>, "The altar which was <span class="accented">by</span> the oracle," or, "<span class="accented">belonging to</span> the oracle;" cf. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3</a>, where, in the visions of the heavenly temple based upon the symbolism of the earthly, the altar of incense is associated with the Divine throne. And it was also so associated in the ceremonial of the tabernacle. The smoke of the incense daily offered on it was supposed to penetrate the veil to the holy of holies, representing the sweet savor of intercession before the mercy-seat itself; and on the Day of Atonement, not only was its incense taken by the high priest within the veil, but also it, as well as the mercy-seat, was sprinkled with the atoning blood. Of the rest of the things described as belonging to the holy of holies, it is to be observed that, though none of them were in it when the Epistle was written, yet all (except the pot of manna and Aaron's rod) were essential to its significance, as will be seen; and all, with these two exceptions, were in Solomon's temple as well as in the original tabernacle. An objection that has been raised to the accuracy of the description, on the ground that the pot and the rod are not said in the Pentateuch to have been placed <span class="accented">inside</span> the ark, is groundless. They were to be laid up "before the LORD" (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>); "before the testimony" (<a href="../../par/numbers/17-10.htm">Numbers 17:10</a>); and "the testimony" elsewhere means the tables of the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>, etc.), which were within the ark. It was most likely that they would be kept for safe preservation in the same place with the" testimony," <span class="accented">before</span> which they were ever to be. Further, what is said (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-9.htm">1 Kings 8:9</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-10.htm">2 Chronicles 5:10</a>) of there being nothing in the ark but the two tables of stone when it was moved into Solomon's temple, is no proof that nothing else had been originally there. It seems, indeed, rather to favor the idea that there had been, as implying that something more might have been expected to be found there. The mercy-seat, as is well known, was the cover of the ark, over which the wings of the two cherubim were spread. The expression, "cherubim of glory," probably has reference to the luminous cloud, significant of the Divine presence, which, occasionally at least (there is no sufficient ground for concluding it to have been a permanent manifestation), is said to have been seen above them. The cherubim, whatever their exact significance, are represented as accompaniments of the Divine glory (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>. and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. and 10.).

The points in this ceremonial here especially noted are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the entrance within the veil was only "once in the year," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> on one only day in the year; for on that day the high priest entered more than once. The meaning is that ordinarily, except on that single day, approach to the innermost shrine was closed to all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That even on that day the high priest <span class="accented">alone</span> entered; neither the people, nor even the priesthood generally, ever had approach to the holiest of all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That even he could not enter "without blood;" neither the daily sacrifices nor all the ordinary ceremonial of the Law availed for his access: he must take with him the blood of special sin offerings, or he still could not enter and live. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> This blood he offered "for <span class="accented">himself</span> and for the <span class="accented">ignorances</span> of the people;" for <span class="accented">himself</span>, since he too was "compassed with infirmity," and required atonement (ver. 2), and also for the people's <span class="accented">ignorances.</span> There is a significance in this word. It was not the sins done with a high hand that had to be atoned for on that day; these were either visited by "<span class="accented">cutting</span> off," or atoned for in ways appointed for the purpose: it was the less definite and undetected sinfulness, infecting the whole community, and remaining after all ceremonial cleansing, so as to debar them from coming "boldly to the throne of grace," that was yearly kept in remembrance on the Day of Atonement. Hence before even the high priest could enter and not die, the mercy-seat over "the testimony" which was within the ark must be enveloped with the cloud of incense and sprinkled with the blood which "covereth sin" (the verb translated "make atonement for" means properly "cover"). The sin was still not taken away, only "covered" for the time; for the holy of holies after the ceremony remained closed as before, and the same rites had to be repeated at each yearly entrance. All that was expressed was an ever-recurring need of atonement, not yet effected truly, though symbolically prefigured. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all</span> (so the A.V., giving the idea correctly, though the expression is simply <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which <span class="accented">might</span> denote only the holy place, as in ver. 2, if we there read <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, but is used for the holy of holies in vers. 24, 25, and for its heavenly antitype in ver. 13. This last, as typified in the earthly sanctuary, is what is intended here) <span class="cmt_word">hath not yet been made manifest, while as the first tabernacle is yet standing</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">has standing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); has a place in the symbolical representation). The "first tabernacle" here spoken of certainly does not mean the earthly one as opposed to the heavenly, but what the expression denotes throughout the chapter, the holy place in distinction from the holy of holies. How, then, is the continued existence of this a sign that the way to the heavenly holy of holies has not yet been made manifest? Obviously because it intervenes between the congregation and the holy of holies of the earthly tabernacle, debarring all approach to the latter, and even hiding it from their view. This debarring intervention signifies that there is no approach for them as yet to what the holy of holies symbolizes. Further, the ordinary ministry of the priests themselves did not extend beyond this "first tabernacle:" this alone was the sphere of the services which they accomplished daily; and so the very fact of its existing for this purpose expressed that even their mediation was not availing for access to the inner mercy-seat. And that this was so is intimated with peculiar significance by the direction that, when the high priest alone entered within the veil, none even of them should be in the holy place at all, so as to see beyond it: "And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>).

Here, certainly, the period of the earthly tabernacle having been the temporal standpoint in all the preceding verses, futurity with regard to it may, without difficulty, be understood; and hence "the good things" may still be regarded as such as have already come in Christ. On the other hand, there is no difficulty in regarding them as still future. For the full and final result of even Christ's perfected high priesthood is not yet come. But what is "the greater and more perfect tabernacle," through which he entered the heavenly holy of holies? It seems evidently, in the first place, to be connected with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, being regarded as the antitype of that "<span class="accented">first</span> tabernacle" through which the high priests on earth had passed in order to enter within the veil; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> having here a local, not an instrumental, sense. The instrumental sense of the same preposition in the next clause (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not against this view. In English, "through his own blood he entered <span class="accented">through</span> the tabernacle" presents no difficulty, though "through" is used in two different senses. But what is exactly meant by the tabernacle through which Christ has passed? Bearing in mind what was said under Hebrews 8:2 of the prophetic visions of a heavenly temple - corresponding to the earthly one - and that the epithet <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied also (ver. 24) by implication to the counterpart of the holy of holies, and also the expression (<a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>), "having passed through the heavens (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)," we may regard it as denoting the heavenly region beyond this visible sphere of things (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#xa0;&#x1fbf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), intervening between the latter and the immediate presence, or "face," of God. Thus "through the greater and more perfect tabernacle" of this verse answers to "having passed through the heavens" of <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14</a>; and "entered once for all into the holy place" of ver. 12 to "entered into heaven itself" (the very heaven) of ver. 24. Thus also the symbolical acts of the Day of Atonement are successively, and in due order, fulfilled. As the high priest first sacrificed the sin offering <span class="accented">outside</span> the tabernacle, and then passed through the holy to the holy of holies, so Christ first offered himself in this mundane sphere of things, and then passed through the heavens to the heaven of heavens. Delitzsch, taking this view, offers a still more definite explanation; thus: "The former (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is that eternal heaven of God himself (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) which is his own self-manifested eternal glory (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), and existed before all worlds; the latter (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>) is the heaven of the blessed, in which he shines upon his creatures in 'the light of love' - 'the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven' of <a href="../../par/revelation/15-5.htm">Revelation 15:5</a>, which the apocalyptic seer beheld filled with incense-smoke from 'the glory of God, and from his power.'" There are other views of what is meant by "the greater and more perfect tabernacle." The most notable, as being that of Chrysostom and the Fathers generally, is that it means Christ's human nature, which he assumed before passing to the throne of the Majesty on high. This view is suggested by his having himself spoken of the <span class="accented">temple</span> of his body (<a href="../../par/john/2-21.htm">John 2:21</a>), and calling it, if the "false witnesses" at his trial reported him truly, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/mark/14-58.htm">Mark 14:58</a>); by the expression (<a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), "The Word was made flesh, and <span class="accented">tabernacled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) among us;" by St. Paul's speaking of the human body as a <span class="accented">tabernacle</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1, 4</a>); and by <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a>, where the "veil" through which we have "a new and living way into the holy place through the blood of Jesus" is said to be his <span class="accented">flesh.</span> There is thus abundant ground for thinking of Christ's body as signified by a tabernacle; and the expression in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19, 20</a> goes some way to countenance such an interpretation here. The objection to it is that it seems neither suggested by the context nor conformable to the type of the high priest on the Day of Atonement. For, if the human body of Christ assumed at his birth is meant, he entered into that before, not after, his atoning sacrifice; and if, with Hofmann, we think rather of his glorified body, in what sense in accordance with the type can it be said that he entered <span class="accented">through</span> it? We should rather say that he ascended <span class="accented">with</span> it to the right hand of God. The further points of contrast between Christ's entrance and that of the earthly high priests are: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The instrumental medium was not the blood of goats and calves (specified here as having been the sin offerings on the Day of Atonement), but <span class="accented">his own</span> blood; he was both Priest and Victim. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> He entered, not yearly, but <span class="accented">once for all</span>; there was no need of continual repetition. And the conclusion is drawn flint the redemption he thus wrought is consequently <span class="accented">complete</span> and <span class="accented">eternal.</span> The first of these contrasts is enlarged on from ver. 13 to ver. 24; the second (denoted by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) is taken up at ver. 25. On the word "redemption" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>: in some other passages <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) it is to be observed that it means, according to its etymology, release obtained by payment of a <span class="accented">ransom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and thus in itself involves the doctrine of <span class="accented">atonement</span> according to the orthodox view. It is true that in many Scripture passages it is used (as also <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x1fef;</span>) in a more general sense to express deliverance only, but never where the redemption of mankind by Christ is spoken cf. In such cases the <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is often distinctly specified, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>, "his life;" in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>, "himself;" in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-7.htm">Ephesians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-14.htm">Colossians 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>, "his blood;" cf. also <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 14. As to how the availing power of the atonement is to be understood, more will be said under the verses that follow.

They are classed together because both were general sin offerings for the whole congregation, representing the idea of continual and unavoidable defilements notwithstanding all the daily sacrifices; the difference between them being that the ashes were reserved for use in known cases of constantly recurring defilement, the sin offerings on the Day of Atonement were for general sin and defilement, known or unknown. But neither, in themselves, could from their very nature avail for more than outward ceremonial cleansing - " the purity of the flesh."

This expression, which comes first in order, has an important bearing on the meaning of the whole passage, and calls for especial consideration. Be it observed, first, that the words are "the eternal Spirit," not "the Holy Spirit." It is not the usual designation of the Third Person of the Holy Trinity. (The reading <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> has not much authority in its favor, and is, besides, much more likely to have been substituted than the other.) What, then, is meant by "the eternal Spirit," through which Christ offered himself spotless? There are three notable texts in which the <span class="accented">Spirit</span> in Christ is opposed to the <span class="accented">flesh</span>: <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. In all these passages the <span class="accented">Spirit is</span> that Divine element of life in Christ, distinct from the human nature which he assumed of the seed of David, in virtue of which he rose from the dead. In us men, too, according to St. Paul, there is the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (sometimes <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span> alone are spoken of) - the higher principle of life within us, in virtue of which we can have communion with God and be influenced by his Holy Spirit. Any act of acceptable sell oblation that we might be capable of would be done through the <span class="accented">spirit</span> that is in us, to which the <span class="accented">flesh</span> is subdued. Corresponding to this in Christ was "the <span class="accented">eternal</span> Spirit" - a truly Divine spiritual Personality, conjoined with his assumed humanity. Through this he overcame death, it being impossible that he should be holden of it; through this, too he offered himself a willing sacrifice, submitting to the full penalty of human sin in obedience to the Father's will. Thus is prominently brought to view the <span class="accented">spiritual</span> aspect of the atonement. Its especial virtue is said to lie, not in the mere suffering or the mere physical blood-shedding and death upon the cross, but in its being a voluntary act of perfect obedience on the part of him who was the Representative of man, and in whom "<span class="accented">the</span> eternal Spirit" triumphed over the weakness of humanity. The agony in the garden (see under ver. 7, etc.) is illustrative of this view of the virtue of the atonement. There we perceive "the eternal Spirit" in the Savior completely victorious over natural human shrinking. The same view appears in the reference to <a href="../../par/psalms/40.htm">Psalm 40</a> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10</a>, where "<span class="accented">Lo</span>, I come to do thy will, O God" expresses the essential principle of the availing sacrifice (see below on Hebrews 10:5, etc.). Hence follows what is said next of the <span class="accented">effect</span> of such a sacrifice as this was - to purify, not the <span class="accented">flesh</span>, but the <span class="accented">conscience</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), meaning "man's inner consciousness" with regard to God and our relations to him. It belonged essentially to the spiritual sphere of things, and in that sphere (as was not the case with the old sacrifices) must be, and is felt to be, its availing power. It <span class="accented">was</span>, in fact, just such a sacrifice as man's conscience, if enlightened, feels to be due to God. Man, as he is now, cannot make it; but in the "Son of man" he sees it made, and thus finds at last the idea of a true atonement fulfilled. In the expression, "dead works," there may be an intended allusion to the dead <span class="accented">bodies</span> from the pollution of which especially the "ashes of an heifer" purified; and in "to serve" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) there is an evident reference to the legal type. As the legal sin offering purified the <span class="accented">flesh</span> from the contamination of contact with the dead, so that the Israelites, thus cleansed, might offer acceptable worship, so Christ's offering of himself fulfils what was thus typified; it purifies the "conscience" from the contamination of "dead works," so that we may offer our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is our <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). On <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, see under Hebrews 6:1. Here, the idea of general pollution pervading the whole congregation having been prominent in what precedes, we may, perhaps, take the expression as denoting all human works whatever "done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his Spirit," all being regarded as tainted with sin, and so <span class="accented">dead</span> for the purpose of justification. The purification from them which is spoken of involves (be it further observed) both justification through atonement and sanctification through grace: the first, since, otherwise, the very meaning of the old sin offerings would not be fulfilled; the second, as denoted by the concluding clause, "to serve," etc. The second is the necessary sequence of the first. Believers are not only "cleansed from their former sins," but also put into a position for offering an acceptable service. In the <span class="accented">life</span> of Christ in whom they live, and who ever <span class="accented">liveth</span> to make intercession for them, they can henceforth "serve the <span class="accented">living</span> God." There is involved, in fact (to return to the account of the new covenant in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>.), both oblivion of past sins and a writing of the Law upon the heart.

For the word is still <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, though here, for reasons that will appear, rendered "testament" in the A.V. The connecting thought here is - It is <span class="accented">because</span> of Christ's sacrifice having been such as has been described, that he is the Mediator of that new and better covenant; it qualified him for being so. A sacrifice, a death, was required for giving it validity (vers. 16-23), and the <span class="accented">character</span> of his sacrifice implies a <span class="accented">better</span> covenant than the old, even such a one as Jeremiah foretold. Further, the purpose of his death is said to be "for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first covenant." For in the passage of Jeremiah the defect of the first covenant was based on the transgression of its conditions by man, while under the new one, such transgressions were to be no more remembered. But this could not be without atonement for them; the whole ceremonial of the Law signified this; and also that such atonement could not be except by death. The death of Christ satisfied this requirement; and so the new covenant could come in. So far the course of thought is clear. Nor is there difficulty in understanding the purport of ver. 18, etc., taken by itself, where the "blood-shedding" that inaugurated the first covenant is regarded as typical of that of Christ in the inauguration of the new one. But there is a difficulty about the intervening verses (16, 17), arising from the apparent use of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in a new sense, not otherwise suggested - that of <span class="accented">testament</span> rather than <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The verses are, as given in the A.V., <span class="cmt_word">For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. a word of which the exact meaning is not clear; some interpret "be brought in, or proved," some "be understood, implied ") <span class="cmt_word">the death of the testator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, equivalent to "him that made it"). <span class="cmt_word">For a testament is of force after men are dead</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>): <span class="cmt_word">otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth</span> (or, <span class="accented">for doth it ever avail while he theft made it liveth?</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-2.htm">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-6.htm">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-16.htm">1 Corinthians 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-26.htm">John 7:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-15.htm">Luke 3:15</a>). Now, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> itself undoubtedly may bear the sense of "testament." Its general meaning is " disposition," or "settlement;" and it may denote either compact between living persons, or a will to take effect after the testator's death. In the verses before us it <span class="accented">appears</span> to be used specifically in the latter sense. For they express general propositions, which are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, but <span class="accented">are</span> true (according to their most obvious sense) of all testaments. Further, this sense is distinctly applicable to the <span class="accented">new</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, regarded as the dying Christ's bequest to his Church. Hence, but for the context, we should naturally so understand it in these verses. The difficulties attending this sense are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The word is not used in this specific sense before or afterwards in this Epistle or in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, which is the basis of the whole argument, or elsewhere, apparently, either in the Old Testament or the New. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The sense does not suit the case of the <span class="accented">old</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which was a covenant between the living God and his people; and there is no intimation of two senses being intended in the two cases: indeed, in the passage before us, the same sense seems to be distinctly implied, since the blood-shedding which inaugurated the old is at once (in ver. 17) spoken of as answering to the death which inaugurated the new, as though death inaugurated both in the same sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The word, in the sense of <span class="accented">covenant</span> (equivalent to the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>), is common in the LXX., expressing an idea familiar to Jews and Jewish Christians, while testamentary dispositions were, as far as we know, unfamiliar to the Hebrews; and, though the Roman testamentary law may have come into use when the Epistle was written, it is thought unlikely that the writer, addressing Hebrews, would have referred to it in illustration of a Divine dispensation, or, if he had, have used a word so well known to them in its traditional sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Christ is called (here as well as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a> and Hebrews 13:20) the <span class="accented">Mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) of the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>: but a testament does not require a Mediator, nor, if it has one, can the same person be both mediator and testator. If, however, the sense of <span class="accented">testament</span> should seem inevitable here, we may explain as follows. Though the word has been used so far in a general sense, yet the writer, on the suggestion of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> in ver. 15, passes in thought at ver. 16 to the specific sense of <span class="accented">testament</span>, as suiting the case of Christ, the language he uses being sufficient for carrying his readers with him in the transition. Further, though the old <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was not in itself a testament, yet it was typical of that which was; its whole ceremonial foreshadowed the future Testator's death, and so, in a typical sense, it might also itself be called one. Consequently, in ver. 18, the inaugurating sacrifices of the old dispensation are regarded as representing the death of the testator; for they prefigured Christ, through whose death the "eternal inheritance" is bequeathed to man. (In accordance with this view, the Vulgate renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">testamentum</span> throughout the Epistle, even when the old dispensation is referred to.) As to <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (translated "the testator"), it <span class="accented">is</span>, according to this view, ultimately God the Father in the new <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, as well as in the old, though, of course, the Godhead could not die. But the Father having placed the whole inheritance destined for mankind in the hands of Christ as Mediator, in <span class="accented">his</span> human death the testator died. And thus one of the difficulties above mentioned may be met, viz. that of Christ being regarded both as Testator and Mediator. Christ <span class="accented">was</span>, in fact, both - Testator, in that, being one with God, he bequeathed through his death the kingdom appointed unto hint by the Father; Mediator, in that it was through his incarnation only that the "eternal inheritance" willed to us by the Father could be transmitted in the way of testament. So in effect Chrysostom explains. Apposite to this view of the subject are his own words (<a href="../../par/luke/22-29.htm">Luke 22:29</a>), "And I appoint (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) unto you a kingdom, as my Father appointed (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) unto me." Here we have the same verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) as is used in the Epistle. And though, in the passage from St. Luke, the idea of a <span class="accented">testamentary</span> appointment is not necessarily implied, yet it is naturally suggested where Christ is speaking on the eve of, and with reference to, his death. There is, however, another view taken (decidedly by Whitby, Ebrard, and in the recent 'Speaker's Commentary'), according to which the idea of a <span class="accented">testament</span> does not come in at all, the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> retaining here, as elsewhere, its usual sense of <span class="accented">covenant.</span> The position is that, though the propositions of vers. 16, 17 are <span class="accented">not</span> true of all covenants, yet there is a sense in which they <span class="accented">are</span> true of any covenant between God and man; which is the only kind of covenant that the writer has in view, or that his readers would be led to think of by the previous reference to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31.htm">Jeremiah 31</a>, or by the associations of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> as used in the Old Testament. The sense in which the propositions are true of such a covenant is thus expressed by Ebrard: "Whenever sinful man will enter into a covenant with the holy God, the man must first die - must first atone for his guilt by death (or must put in a substitute for himself)." This principle is expressed (it is alleged), not only by the sacrifices that inaugurated this covenant of the Law, but also wherever a covenant between God and man is spoken of in the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the covenant with Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-8.htm">Genesis 15:8</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>.). In the case of covenants between man and man (as between Abraham and Abimelech, and between Jacob and Laban) there was no need of slain victims, whoso life had to be given for that of one of the contracting parties; but there is always expressed such need in the case of a covenant between God and man. Further, the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, is, according to this view, illustrated by <a href="../../par/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, where the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui ordinant testamentum ejus super sacrificiis</span>). The same preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is used in both passages, and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is supposed to express the same idea as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. This passage from the psalm is certainly much to the point in support of the view before us, serving moreover to meet in some degree one principal objection to it, viz. that it requires <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to be understood of the human party to the covenant, and not of its Divine Author. Such is not the most obvious application of the word, nor the one sanctioned by the quotation from Jeremiah, or by other references to the Divine covenant (see <span class="accented">supra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-10.htm">Hebrews 8:10</a>, and also <a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-2.htm">Deuteronomy 5:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-29.htm">Luke 12:29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-25.htm">Acts 3:25</a>; as well as <a href="../../par/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>, quoted below (ver. 20), where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, is the word in the LXX. But such is the application in <a href="../../par/psalms/50-5.htm">Psalm 50:5</a>, and may be considered, therefore, not untenable. The writer may, indeed, have had the expression in the psalm in his mind when he wrote the verses before us. It appears from what has been said that difficulties attend both the views that have been above explained. It is not here attempted to decide between them.

He "came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do." And then he wrote all the words of the LORD in a book, and builded an altar under the mount, and sacrifices were offered, and half of the blood was sprinkled on the altar, and the words were read from the book, and again the people undertook to observe them, and the other half of the blood was sprinkled on the people, and so the covenant was ratified. The essential part of the whole ceremony being the "blood-shedding," it is of no importance for the general argument that the account in Exodus is not exactly followed. The variations from it are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The mention of goats as well as calves or bullocks - of water - of the scarlet wool and hyssop - and of the sprinkling of the book, instead of the altar, as in Exodus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The words spoken by Moses are differently given, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> being substituted for <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. On these variations we may observe that the mention of goats may have been suggested to the writer's mind by the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, previously alluded to; and it is not <span class="accented">inconsistent</span> with the account in Exodus, where the victims used for the "burnt offerings" are not specified, only the bullocks for "peace offerings." Nor is there inconsistency in the other additions to the ceremonial. The scarlet wool and hyssop were the usual instruments of aspersion (a bunch of the latter being apparently bound by the former to a stick of cedar; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/12-22.htm">Exodus 12:22</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-50.htm">Leviticus 14:50</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6, 18</a>). It may have been usual to mix water with the blood used for aspersion, if only to prevent coagulation (see Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34</a>), though in some cases certainly also with a symbolical meaning (cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-5.htm">Leviticus 14:5, 50</a>); and, if the book was, as it was likely to be, on the altar when the latter was sprinkled (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-6.htm">Exodus 24:6, 7</a>), it would itself partake of this sprinkling, and, being thus consecrated, would be then taken from the altar to be read from to the people and to receive their assent, previously to the sprinkling of themselves with the moiety of the blood reserved. Probably the whole account, as here given, was the traditional one at the time of writing (see below, on ver. 21). With regard to the slightly altered form of the words spoken by Moses, it is an interesting suggestion that the writer may have had in his mind our Lord's corresponding words in the institution of the Eucharist, beginning in all the accounts with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and being thus worded: in St. Luke, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: and in St. Matthew and St. Mark, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, St. Matthew adding <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. That Christ in these words referred to those of Moses is obvious, speaking of his own outpoured blood as the antitype of that wherewith the old <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was dedicated; and it is likely that the writer of the Epistle would have Christ's words in his mind.

It is true that no sprinkling of the tabernacle or its furniture with blood is mentioned in the Pentateuch; only the anointing of them with oil (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>). But the garments of Aaron and his sons are said on that occasion to have been sprinkled with the blood as well as with the anointing oil (Hebrews 8:30), and Josephus ('Ant.,' 3:08. 6) says that this blood-sprinkling was extended also to the tabernacle and its vessels (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>). Here, as well as in ver. 19, our writer may be supposed to follow the traditional account, with which there is still nothing in the Pentateuch inconsistent. Be it observed again that the force of the argument does not depend on these added details, but on the general principle, abundantly expressed in the original record, which is assorted in the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a></div><div class="verse">And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And almost</span> (rather, <span class="accented">eve may almost say that</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all things are according to the Law purified with blood; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> The essentiality of blood, which is "the <span class="accented">life</span> of all flesh," for atonement and consequent remission, is emphatically asserted in <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>, which expresses the principle of the whole sacrificial ritual. The idea seems to be that the life of man is forfeit to Divine justice (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>), and so blood, representing life, must be offered instead of his life for atonement. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/9-23.htm">Hebrews 9:23</a></div><div class="verse"><i>It was</i> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was therefore necessary</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in accordance with the principle above expressed) <span class="cmt_word">that the patterns</span> (rather, <span class="accented">copies</span>, see <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a>, <span class="accented">supra</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span> According to the view taken under Hebrews 8:2 and Hebrews 9:11, "the heavenly things" here must be taken to denote the corresponding realities in the heavenly sphere of things to which Christ has gone. But how can they themselves be said to require purification or cleansing? The mundane tabernacle did, being itself conceived as polluted by human sin; but how so of the unpolluted heavenly tabernacle? The answer may be that the expressions, chosen to suit the case of the earthly type, need not be pressed in all their details as applying to the heavenly sanctuary. With regard to the latter, they may he meant only to express that, though it be itself pure, yet <span class="accented">man</span> requires purification for access to it, and that for this purpose "better sacrifices" are required. "In hac apodosi verbum <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">mundari</span>, subauditum, facit hypallagem: nam <span class="accented">exleslia</span> per se sunt pura, sed nos purificandi fuimus, ut ilia possemus capessere" (Bengel). The general meaning is obvious enough. Commentators sometimes raise needless difficulties, and may sometimes even miss the essential purport of a passage by the too constant application of the critical microscope. If, however, it be thought necessary to find a sense in which the heavenly sanctuary may be said to need purification, the idea may be the appeasing of Divine wrath which bars the entrance of mankind.

"heaven itself," the heaven of heavens, the immediate presence or "face" of God, the "throne of the Majesty on high," to which Christ passed through the intermediate heavens. There he now (the perpetual <span class="accented">now</span> of the new era of accomplished redemption), in his humanity, in behalf of and representing all humanity, beholds for ever the very face of the eternal God, which Moses could not see and live, and of which the typical high priest saw from year to year but the emblem, in transitory glimpses, through intervening clouds of incense.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/hebrews/9-25.htm">Hebrews 9:25</a></div><div class="verse">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> blood not his own, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="cmt_word">for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now</span> (probably <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, meaning "as it is ") <span class="cmt_word">once at the end of the ages hath he appeared</span> (rather, <span class="accented">been manifested</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> Here (as above noted) the idea of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> in ver. 12 is taken up. That Christ's offering of himself is once for all, needing no repetition, follows from the view of it already given, viz. that it is a perpetual presentation of himself, after fully availing sacrifice of himself, before the very face of God. That this is of necessity once for all is now further shown by the consideration that repeated offerings of himself would involve the impossible condition of repeated deaths. Observe that "offer himself" in ver. 25 does not refer to the death upon the cross, but to the intercession before the eternal mercy-seat after accomplished atonement, answering to the high priest's entrance, with the blood of previous sacrifice, within the veil. The death itself is denoted in ver. 26 by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ("suffered"). The argument rests on the principle, already established as being signified by the whole of the ancient ritual, that, for acceptable intercession in behalf of man, previous death or blood-shedding is in every case required. But why add "since the foundation of the world"? We must supply the thought of the retrospective efficacy of Christ's atonement. Ever since sin entered, man needed atonement, signified, but not effected, by the ancient sacrifices. Christ's one offering of himself has supplied this primeval need, availing, not only for the present and future, but also for all past ages. This view was definitely expressed, with reference to "transgressions which were under the first covenant," in ver. 15, and, though not repeated here, is prominent in the writer's mind (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>, where God's righteousness is said to have been shown in Christ with regard to "the passing over of sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God," as well as to justification of believers now; also <a href="../../par/romans/5.htm">Romans 5</a>, where the effect of Christ's obedience is declared to be coextensive with that of Adam's transgression). This view accounts for "since the foundation of the world," the idea being that, the transgressions requiring atonement having been since then, repeated deaths since then would have been needed had not Christ's one offering of himself availed for all time, just as repeated sacrifices were needed for the high priest's symbolical yearly intercessions. The question is not asked, nor is any reason given, why this one all-sufficient offering was deferred till so long after the need began. It is enough to know that such has been, in fact, the Divine will, viz. that not till the fullness of time was come - not till the end (or consummation) of the long preceding sinful ages - should the Redeemer once for all be manifested for atonement. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, seems certainly to imply the idea, otherwise known to have been prevalent in the apostolic age, of the end of all things being close at hand; and this expectation further accounts for the reference to the past rather than the future in the expression, "since the foundation of the world." For, with regard to the future, the second coming of Christ was the one great idea present to the minds of Christians, the intervening time being regarded by them as but the dawn of coming day (see, on this head, what was said under Hebrews 1:2). The strong expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (for the sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a>, where it means "abrogation"), used as it here is with reference to all the transgressions of the ages past, though not to be pressed so as to invalidate what is elsewhere said of the future penal consequences of all willful and unrepented sin, may still be cited among the texts supporting the view of those who "trust the larger hope."

The ideas of <span class="accented">bearing</span> and of <span class="accented">taking away</span> may thus be both implied. In contrast with this is the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> ("without, or apart from, sin") when he shall appear again. For then he will have been, as he is now, removed from it altogether - from its burden and its surroundings; it is in glory only that he will then appear. And so also "to them that look for him" his appearing will be "unto salvation" only. They, too, will have done with sin. The insertion of the words, "to them that look for him," precludes the conclusion that it will be so to all. The many passages that express the doom of those who shall be set on the left hand, whatever they imply, retain their awful meaning (cf. especially <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>
