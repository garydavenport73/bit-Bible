"The name," says Dr. Pussy, "is probably the Syriac name of 'priest,' used in Holy Scripture of idolatrous priests, because the Syrians were idolaters" Not only shall the persons of these priests be cut off, but their very name and memory shall vanish (<a href="../../par/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the priests</span> (<span class="accented">kohanim</span>).

The worship of the sun, moon, and stars was a very ancient form of error, the heavenly bodies being regarded as the representatives of the powers of nature and the originators of events on earth (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). It was especially prevalent in the time of Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), On the flat roofs of the houses, which were used as places of meditation, recreation, or conference (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), they erected altars for family worship of the heavenly bodies. Here they both burned incense (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>) and offered animal sacrifices (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). "In Syrian cities," says Dr. Thomson, "the roofs are a great comfort. The ordinary houses have no other place where the inmates, can either see the sun, smell the air, dry their clothes, set out their flower pots, or do numberless other things essential to their health and comfort. During a large part of the year the roof is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening. There multitudes sleep during the summer" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Them that worship and that,</span> etc.; rather, <span class="accented">the worshippers who</span>, etc. These were people who endeavoured to blend the worship of God with that of Baal, or halted between two opinions (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Swear by the Lord;</span> rather, swear to the <span class="accented">Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bind themselves by oath to him, and at the same time <span class="cmt_word">swear by Malcham;</span> <span class="accented">swear by their king</span>, Baal, or Moloch; call upon him as god.

But it is, perhaps, best to retain the name untranslated, in which ease it would be the appellation of the god Moloch, who could hardly be omitted in enumerating the objects of idolatrous worship (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; and notes on Amos 1:15; 5:26).

The punishment of the wicked is regarded as a satisfaction offered to the Divine justice. <span class="cmt_word">He hath bid his guests;</span> <span class="accented">he hath consecrated his called</span>. The "called ones" are the strange nations whom God summons to execute his vengeance.

These are said to be "sanctified," as if engaged in a holy war, when summoned to punish those who had become as heathen. So those who are called to chastise Babylon are termed "my sanctified ones" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>), as being the instruments appointed and set apart to  carry out this purpose (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-7.htm">Jeremiah 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>). The particular agents intended are not specified by the prophet, whose mission was not directed to any such definition. He has to speak generally of the judgment to come, not of those whom God should employ to inflict it. We know from other sources that the Chaldeans are meant, they or the Assyrians being always announced as the executors of God's vengeance on his rebellions people. The notion, adopted by Ewald, Hitzig, and others, that the prophet refers to some supposed invasion of Scythians which took place about this time, would never have been started had not such authors desired to eliminate the predictive element from prophetic utterances. The vague account of Herod., 1:105 gives no support to the assertion that the Scythians invaded Palestine in Josiah's reign; nor is there a trace of any knowledge of such irruption in Zephaniah or Jeremiah (see Introduction, &sect; I.).

The royal family, not specially the sons of Josiah, who, if they were then in existence, must have been mere children, but princes of the royal house. The reference may be particularly to the sons of the king reigning when the judgment fell (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-7.htm">2 Kings 25:7</a>). The king himself is not mentioned as subject to the judgment, inasmuch as he was pious and obedient (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-27.htm">2 Chronicles 34:27</a>, etc.). In the mention of these "children" Keil finds proof of the late origin of the prophecy. Such as are clothed with strange apparel. This clause must represent the sin for which the princes are "visited." "Strange" apparel means "foreign" apparel, and this implied foreign manners and habits. The Israelites were reminded by their very dress that they were a peculiar people, consecrated to God's service (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-37.htm">Numbers 15:37</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>). These nobles, however, assumed the dress of the Egyptians and other nations with which they came in contact, and, despising their own national customs, copied the manners and vices of foreigners (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-32.htm">Ezekiel 20:32</a>; 1 Macc. 1:11-15).

There is no allusion to the circumstance of the priests of Dagon abstaining from treading on the threshold of their temple in consequence of what happened to the idol at Ashdod (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-5.htm">1 Samuel 5:5</a>). It is inconceivable that this merely local custom, which demonstrated the impotence of the false god, should have been imported into Judah. where, indeed, the worship of Dagon seems never to have made any way. The following clause explains the meaning which the Latin version intimates, <span class="accented">Omnem qui arroganter ingreditur super limen</span> - all those who, carrying out their masters' wishes, violently invade the houses of others and pillage them of their contents. The expression, "to leap over the threshold," seems to have been a common term for burglary and stealing with violence. <span class="cmt_word">Which fill their masters' houses.</span> These retainers plunder and steal in order that they may increase their masters' treasures. The king (though not Josiah) may be meant, the plural being the plural of majesty, or the idol temples. The LXX., followed by Jerome, renders, "who fill the house of the Lord their God." This is plainly erroneous, as there is no question here about the temple at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Violence and deceit;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the fruits of, what they have extorted by, violence and fraud (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-27.htm">Jeremiah 5:27</a>).

It does not seem a very appropriate appellation for a lengthy valley like the Tyropceum, nor is there any trace of such a name being applied to it elsewhere.

This is a very apposite interpretation; but there is no sufficient ground for rejecting the translation of the Authorized Version, which is supported by high authority, is agreeable to the use of the word, and affords a satisfactory sense.

Thus the four quarters of the world are virtually specified: the Philistines representing the west,, the Moabites and Ammonites (vers. 8-10) the east, the Cushites (vers. 11, 12) the south, and the Assyrians (vers. 13-15) the north. <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span> (see note on Amos 1:6) <span class="cmt_word">shall be forsaken;</span> depopulated and desolate.

Gaza (see note on Amos 1:7), after being depopulated and again re-peopled by Alexander the Great, fell into the hands of Ptolemy, and was destroyed by Antiochus,  <span class="date">B.C. 198</span> (Polybius, 'Reliq.,' 16:40; Pusey, p. 457). Often rebuilt, it was as often razed to the ground; and the present representative of the ancient town, Ghuzzeh, stands upon a hill composed of the accumulated ruins of successive cities. Of the condition of Ashkelon, Dr. Thomson writes, "There are no buildings of the ancient city now standing, but broken columns are mixed up with the soil .... Let us climb to the top of these tall fragments at the southeast angle of the wall, and we shell have the whole scene of desolation before us, stretching terrace after terrace, quite down to the sea on the northwest .... No site in this country has so deeply impressed my mind with sadness. They have stretched out upon Ashkelon the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness. Thorns have come up in her palaces, and brambles in the fortresses thereof, and it is a habitation of dragons and a court for owls (<a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11-13</a>)" ('The Land and the Book,' p. 546). "It was for ages," says Dr. Porter, "a great and strong city. Under the Philistines, the Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Saracens, the Crusaders, it was a place of note. The shattered walls that still surround the site were built by Richard Coeur de Lion. When I first clambered to the top of a broken bastion, a scene of desolation burst suddenly upon my view for which I was not prepared, though I had seen Baal-bec and Palmyra, Heliopolis and Memphis. The whole site was before me, and not a fragment of a house standing. One small section was covered with little gardens; but over the rest of the site lay smooth rounded hillocks of drifting sand. The sand is fast advancing - so fast, that probably ere the close of the century the site of Ascalon will have been blotted out forever" ('Illust. of Bible Proph.,' p. 21). As for Ekron, <span class="accented">hod</span>. <span class="accented">Akir</span>, travellers note that it is now a little village, consisting of about fifty mud houses, without a remnant of antiquity except two large walls; its very ruins have vanished. The omission of Gath, a town at this time of small importance (see note on Amos 1:6), is probably owing to a feeling of the symbolism of numbers, four denoting completion, or the whole, like "the four winds, the four ends of the earth," etc.

We at length pitched our tents by the lonely fountain of Heshbon.

The hill was the nucleus of the city. Its sides are covered  with ruins, and remains of houses, temples, and other buildings are strewn over a considerable section of the adjoining plain. All is desolate. Not a building, and scarcely a fragment of a wall, is standing; yet, though deserted for centuries, it bears its ancient name. I looked from Heshbon far and wide over the ancient territory of the Moabites, and saw desolation everywhere. The old towns and villages are all deserted and in ruins. In fact, there is not at this moment a single inhabited town or village in Moab, except Kerak, which stands on the extreme southern border. The sites of many were visible - grey mounds dotting the plain" ('Illust. of Bible Proph.,' pp. 24, 25). "The cities, towns, villages, are all in ruins. ... And no attempt is ever made to rebuild or repair; no man ventures to seek even a temporary abode among the ruined cities of Moab.

Though this country lay to the northeast of Palestine, its armies attacked from the north, and it is generally represented as a northern power. Its destruction was foretold (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-12.htm">Isaiah 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-14.htm">Nahum 1:14</a>, etc.). In this verse the Hebrew verbs are not in the simple future, but in the imperative or optative mood, "Let him stretch out his hand," etc., as though the prophet were praying that the enemies of his people might be overthrown. <span class="cmt_word">Nineveh</span>.

For the destruction of Nineveh, see the Introduction to Nahum, &sect; I.) <span class="cmt_word">Dry like a wilderness.</span> The country shall become an and desert. Assyria was greatly indebted for its remarkable fertility to a very successful system of artificial irrigation, and when this was not maintained, great tracts soon relapsed into a wilderness (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:68). "Cultivation," says Professor Rawlinson, "is now the exception instead of the rule. 'Instead of the luxuriant fields, the groves and gardens of former times, nothing now meets the eye but an arid waste' (Chesny). Large tracts are covered by unwholesome marshes, producing nothing but enormous reeds; others lie waste and bare, parched up by the fierce heat of the sun, and utterly destitute of water; in some places sand drifts accumulate, and threaten to make the whole region a mere portion of the desert" ('Anc.

(Compare similar predictions, <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cormorant</span> (<span class="accented">kaath</span>); probably <span class="accented">the pelican</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">onocrotalus</span>; the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which word Schleusner thinks to have been interchanged with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> that follows soon afterwards.

The Septuagint has, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: the Vulgate, <span class="accented">ericius.</span> But neither hedgehog nor porcupine utters cries or frequents pools of water, and it may well be doubted whether some marsh-loving bird is not meant. Certainly the following clause suits the habits of a bird better than those of a hedgehog (see 'Bible Educator,' 3:312, where Dr. Tristram is quoted saying, "As a matter of fact, the bittern is very abundant in these swamps of the Tigris, and in all the marshy grounds of Syria; and its strange booming note, disturbing the stillness of the night, gives an idea of desolation which nothing but the wail of the hyena can equal"). No notice of the bittern seems to be found in the Assyrian monuments, though the mention of the heron is not uncommon. The <span class="accented">kaath</span> and <span class="accented">kippod</span> are commonly mentioned together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>. II. <span class="cmt_word">The upper lintels;</span> "the capitals" of the columns (see note on Amos 9:1, where the same word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used). <span class="cmt_word">Their voice shall sing in the windows;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the voice of the songster in the window.</span> Birds shall perch and sing in the apertures of the ruined palaces.

Others translate, "Hark! it singeth in the windows." There are no traces of windows in any of the Assyrian palaces, even in the case of chambers next the outer walls. If daylight were admitted, it must have entered through openings in the ceilings (Layard, 'Nineveh.' 2:260). Desolation shall be in the thresholds. The word rendered "desolation" (<span class="accented">chorebh</span>) Jerome notes may be read as meaning "sword," "drought." and "raven;" he adopts the last signification, and translates, in agreement with the LXX., <span class="accented">corvus.</span> But it seems best to take the term as signifying "desolation;" no human creature shall be found there, only ruin and rubbish. Ewald renders, "Owls shall sing in the windows, crows on the threshold, 'shivered. crushed.'" For he shall uncover (<span class="accented">he hath laid bare</span>) the cedar work. God, or the enemy, has so destroyed the palaces that the cedar panelling is exposed to the weather. Jerome has, "Attenuabo robur ejus." We see by Sennacherib's boast (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>) that the Assyrians imported cedars for building purposes. And we have monumental evidence of the employment of cedar in palaces at least since  the time of Assurnazirpal,  <span class="date">B.C. 860</span>. Esar-haddon reports that he received cypress and cedar from Lebanon as tribute; and Assurbanipal states that in erecting his palace he used cedar pillars from Sirjon and Lebanon (Schrader, 'Die Keilinschrift. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 183, 453). Neriglissar, King of Babylon,  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, in rebuilding his palace, records that he "arranged tall cedars for its roof" ('Records of the Past,' 5:142).

This may be the sense intended: but looking to the thought in <a href="../../par/isaiah/66-20.htm">Isaiah 66:20</a> (where it is said that the Gentiles shall bring the Israelites out of all nations as a meat offering unto the Lord), we had better render the passage as the Revised Version margin, "They shall bring my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, for an offering unto me." The remote Gentiles shall show their faith in God by aiding the Hebrews among them to turn to the Lord; this shall be their offering to the true God, whom they have learned to adore. When they themselves are converted, they shall be evangelists to the Hebrews of the Dispersion. For this work of the Gentiles in converting the Hebrews, Wordsworth compares <a href="../../par/songs/3-4.htm">Song of Solomon 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/8-8.htm">Song of Solomon 8:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-5.htm">Isaiah 61:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-18.htm">Isaiah 65:18-21</a>.

The universal worship of Messianic times is expressed in the ceremonial terms of the old dispensation, but has a very real applicableness to the Christian religion (see note on Malachi 1:11).
