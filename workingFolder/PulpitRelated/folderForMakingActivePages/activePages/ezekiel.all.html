In the "expanse," or firmament, like the "terrible crystal," there is seen as before the likeness of a sapphire throne (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>, note). The form of <span class="cmt_word">the man</span> who is the manifestation of Jehovah is implied, though not named. It is he who speaks to the captain of the six ministers of vengeance, himself the seventh, and bids him go in beneath the "whirling wheels" that are beneath the cherub (collective singular, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a>), and fill his hands with <span class="cmt_word">coals of fire</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a>), and scatter them over the city, as the symbol of its doom. We are reminded of Isaiah's vision (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a>); but there the work of the fire was to purify, here simply to destroy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Vers 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the cherubim stood,</span> etc. The position of the cherubim is defined, with a vivid distinctness of detail, which once more reminds us of Dante. They had been standing on the right, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the southern side of the sanctuary. What follows is probably a reproduction of the change of positions described in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-3.htm">Ezekiel 9:3</a>, and the verbs should be taken, therefore, as pluperfects. The cloud of glory, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1, 2</a>, the Shechinah, that was the taken of the Divine presence, filled the court, but the glory itself had moved to the threshold at the first stage of its departure.

The hands of the "living creatures," now recognized as cherubim, had been mentioned in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>, and it is one of those hands that gives the fire into the hands of the linen vested minister of wrath. The elemental forces of nature, of which the cherubim are, partly at least, the symbols, are working out the purposes of Jehovah. The two words translated <span class="cmt_word">wheels</span> are different in the Hebrew. The first is singular and collective (<span class="accented">galgal</span>, the "whirling thing," used of the wheel of a war chariot, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-28.htm">Isaiah 5:28</a>), and might well be translated "chariot" here. The second, that used in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15, 16</a>, also in the singular, is applied to the single wheel of the four by which the angel, ministers stood.

The prophet struggles, as before, to relate what he has actually seen  in the visions of God. The fact is stated as explaining the mention of the "hand" in ver. 7. That, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>, was one of their members (see notes on Ezekiel 1:15-17). All that had seemed most startling and awful to him on the banks of Chebar is now seen again - the four living creatures, now named cherubim the wheel by each, the unswerving motion of the wheels in their onward course. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-9.htm">Ezekiel 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels <i>was</i> as the colour of a beryl stone.</div><div class="comm">

With all the complex structure of the cherubic chariot, all was simple in its action. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels, and that gave unity (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-20.htm">Ezekiel 1:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, <i>were</i> full of eyes round about, <i>even</i> the wheels that they four had.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their whole body.</span> Here there is distinctly a new feature. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a> the "rings" of the wheels were "full of eyes." Here the eyes are everywhere. It is not hard to interpret this part of the vision. The prophet receives a new impression of the all-seeing eye of Jehovah. Everywhere, as he stands face to face with the forces of nature, he can say, <span class="accented">must</span> say, within himself, "Thou God seest me" (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>). There is an eye that looks upon him where he least expects it. The same thought appears in the stone with seven eyes in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>. St. John reproduces it in the same form as Ezekiel, with the exception of the wheels, which form no part of his vision, in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-13.htm">Ezekiel 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for the wheels,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels</span>; or better still, to keep the collective force of the singular <span class="accented">galgal, the chariot.</span> He recognized that as the right name of the whole mysterious and complex form. It, was nothing less than the chariot throne of the King of the universe. There is no sufficient reason for taking the noun, with the Authorized Version, as a vocative. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14</a></div><div class="verse">And every one had four faces: the first face <i>was</i> the face of a cherub, and the second face <i>was</i> the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first face was the face of a cherub,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">of the cherub.</span> This takes the place of "the face of an ox" in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>, and it is first in order instead of being, as there, the third. It is as though, in this second vision, he recognizes that this was emphatically <span class="accented">the</span> cherubic form. Possibly the article indicates that this was the form that had given the "coals of fire" in ver. 7. Each form, we must remember, had the four faces, but the prophet names the face which each presented to him as he gazed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-15.htm">Ezekiel 10:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the cherubims were lifted up.

The chariot throne was, as it were, ready for its kingly Rider. The "glory"-cloud, or Shechinah. takes its place over them, and the departure begins. From that hour the temple was, in Ezekiel's thoughts, to be, till the time of restoration contemplated in ch. 40-48, what Shiloh had been, a God-deserted place. We arc reminded of the voice which Josephus tells us was heard before the final destruction of the second temple, exclaiming, "Let us depart hence," as the priests were making ready for the Pentecostal feast ('Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also <i>were</i> beside them, and <i>every one</i> stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD'S house; and the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> over them above.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The departure has the east gate of the Lord's house for its starting point. By that gate, in the later vision of the restored temple, the glory of the Lord was to return (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>). For "every one" read "it," <span class="accented">sc.</span> the <span class="accented">galgal</span>, or complex structure of the chariot. The Hebrew verb is in the singular, but, as the italics show, there is no word answering to "every one."

Now, as it were, he understands why the first vision was seen as coming from the north. He does not tell us whether the journey of which he saw the beginning was to end. For the present there was a halt, as we learn from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>, "over the midst of the city." Even when the vision ended, it had not gone further than the Mount of Olives. We may conjecture, however, that he thought of its goal as that more sacred region of the heavens in which it had at first manifested itself (see note on Ezekiel 1:4). It was, at any rate, no longer in the temple. The banks of Chebar or any other place might become, as Bethel had been to Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-17.htm">Genesis 28:17</a>), as "the house of God" and "the gate of heaven." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Possibly, after all, the number was used more or less vaguely - a "round" number, as we say (Smend). It is probably safe, however, to think of them as representing the lay element of authority. Nothing is known further as to the persons named. Jaazaniah is distinguished by his parentage from his namesake of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>. Both were probably familiar to those for whom Ezekiel wrote, as leaders of the party that was "always devising mischief," in opposition, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to Jeremiah and the true prophets. Possibly the meanings of the names <span class="cmt_word">Jaazaniah</span> (equivalent to "God hearkens") the son of Azur (equivalent to "The Helper"), <span class="cmt_word">Pelatiah</span> (equivalent to "God rescues") <span class="cmt_word">the son of Benaiah</span> (equivalent to "God builds"), are chosen as with a grim irony. The name of Azur meets us in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a> as that of the father of the false prophet Hananiah. The death of Pelatiah was probably an historical event to which the prophet pointed as a warning to those who, either at Jerusalem or among the exiles, were speaking as he spoke.

Let us build houses, not, as Jeremiah bids (Jeremiah 39:5), in the land of exile, but here in Jerusalem, where we shall remain in safety. Are we threatened with the imagery of the 'seething pot' (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>)? Let us remember  that the caldron protects the meat in it from the fire. The walls of the city will protect us from the army of the Chaldeans." The temper which clothed itself in this language was that of the self-confident boastful security of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a>; and the death of Hananiah, the son of Azur, in that history presents a parallel to that of Pelatiah in this. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Grammatically, however, the rendering of the Revised Version is preferable: <span class="accented">The time is not near for building houses</span>; probably, as before, with a reference to Jeremiah's advice. "We," they seem to say, "are not come to that plaint yet. We will trust, as in (1), in our interpretation of the caldron." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the whole, I incline, while adopting the Revised Version rendering, to interpret the words, as Smend takes them, as the defiant utterance of despair: "It is no time for building houses, here or elsewhere. We are doomed. We are destined (I borrow the nearest analogue of modern proverbial speech) 'to stew in our own juice.' Well, let us meet it as we best may." I find what suggests this view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the improbability that the thought of the caldron could ever have been received as a message of safety (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3, 6</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in the despairing tone of most of the sayings that Ezekiel records (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>). Probably there were, as in other like crises in the history of nations (say, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in those of the Franco-German War) rapid alternations between the two moods of boastful security and defiant despair - the <span class="accented">galgenhumor</span>, the courage of the gallows, as Smend calls it; and the same words might be uttered now in this temper, and now in that. In either case, there was the root element of the absence of repentance and submission.

As in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-2.htm">Ezekiel 2:2</a>, the Spirit of Jehovah comes upon him, and throws him into the prophetic ecstasy. It is noticeable that here, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a>, his message is not to Judah only, but to the whole <span class="cmt_word">house of Israel</span> as represented by those to whom he spoke. <span class="cmt_word">I know the things</span>. This, as ever, was one of the notes of a true prophet, that he shared, as was needed for his work, in the knowledge of him from whom no secrets are hid (<a href="../../par/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-4.htm">Matthew 9:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">1 Corinthians 14:25</a>).

Not they, but the carcases of their victims, were as the "flesh" in the "caldron." For themselves, there was another fate in reserve. Neither to be protected by the caldron nor to meet their doom in it, but to be brought out of it. Death, by famine, sword, or pestilence (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>), might be the doom of some, but for others, perhaps specially for those whom the prophet addresses, there would be captivity first, and death from the sword which they feared, afterwards.

Then they should see that their defiant speech as to the "caldron" and "the flesh" would be of no avail. Thus they should know that the prophet had spoken in the name of Jehovah, and that their punishment by the heathen was the righteous retribution for their having walked in the ways of the heathen.

Had Pelatiah died suddenly during a council meeting? Compare the death of Hananiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-17.htm">Jeremiah 28:17</a>. As it was, even in the vision, the death so startled and horrified the prophet, that he burst out again into a prayer like that of ch. 9:8. Was the "residue," the "remnant" of Israel, represented by one of the chief counsellors of the city, to be thus cut off?

As in Jeremiah's vision (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>), they were the "good figs;" those in the city, the vile and worthless. They were the remnant, the residue, for whom there was a hope of better things. They were despised as far off from the Lord. They were really nearer to his presence than those who worshipped in the temple from which Jehovah had  departed. Ewald and Smend take the words as indicative: "Ye are far," etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-16.htm">Ezekiel 11:16</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet will</span> <span class="cmt_word">I be unto them as a little sanctuary</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">a little while</span>, as marking that the state described was transient and provisional. For a time, Ezekiel and the exiles were to find the presence of Jehovah manifested as in the vision of Chebar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>), or felt spiritually, and this would make the spot where they found themselves as fully a holy place as the temple had been. There also they would have a "house of God." But this was not to be their permanent lot. There was to be a restoration to "the land of Israel" (ver. 17; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>), to the visible sanctuary, to a second temple no longer desecrated by the pollutions that had defiled the first. As with all such prophecies, the words had "springing and germinant accomplishments." In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, we have Ezekiel's ideal vision of their fulfilment. A literal but incomplete fulfilment is formed in the work of restoration achieved by Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, and the hopes then cherished by Haggai and Zechariah. A more complete but less literal fulfilment appears in the Church of Christ as the true Israel of God (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>), and in the Jerusalem which is above (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). In the fact that in the seer's vision of that heavenly city there is no temple, but the presence of "the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb" <a href="../../par/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>), we find the crowning development of Ezekiel's thought. Intermediate expansions are found <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> in the gradual substitution of the synagogue for the temple in the religious life of Israel; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> in our Lord's words to the woman of Samaria (<a href="../../par/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21-24</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> in his promise that where two or three are gathered together in his Name, there he would be in the midst of them (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a>). The thought that it is the presence of Jehovah that makes the sanctuary, not the sanctuary that secures the presence, Ezekiel may have learnt from the fate of Shiloh (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will give you the land</span> <span class="cmt_word">of Israel.</span> The marginal references in the Authorized Version show how entirely Ezekiel was following in the footsteps of his master Jeremiah, as he had done in those of Isaiah, in their prophecies of restoration. Here also the law of" springing and germinant accomplishments" finds its application. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 47:13-48:35) has his ideal of a new geographical Israel, as of a new local temple, a land from which idolatrous shrines and high places have disappeared. St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>.) clings to the thought of a restoration of the literal Israel, even while he strips it of Ezekiel's geographical limitations.

As in the symbolic action of the joining of the two sticks in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-15.htm">Ezekiel 37:15-22</a>, so here, the hope of the prophet, like that of Isaiah and Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-39</a>), looked forward to the unity of the restored people. Judah should no longer vex Ephraim, nor Ephraim Judah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>). The long standing line of cleavage should disappear. Oneness of purpose and of action would characterize the new Israel of God. So, in our Lord's prayer for his Church, there is the prayer that "they may be one" - made perfect in one (<a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21-23</a>). Left to itself, Israel tended, as all human communities have tended, to an ever-subdividing individualism, fruitful in sects and parties and schisms. Even the highest of those aspirations has remained as yet without any adequate fulfilment. The ideal unity of the Christian Church is as far distant as that of the Church of Israel. It remains for us to welcome any approximate fulfilments as pledges and earnests of the future unity of the true Israel of God in the heavenly Jerusalem. In the prophet's thoughts that unity was to be brought about by the Divine gift of a "new Spirit," loyal, obedient, unselfish. We note how distinctly, whether consciously or unconsciously, Ezekiel reproduces the thought, almost the very words, of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37-39</a>; how his words are in their turn reproduced in <a href="../../par/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-5</a>. The eternal hope asserts itself again and again in spite of all partial failures and disappointments. <span class="cmt_word">I will take the stony heart out of their flesh.</span> The thought is, as we have seen, identical with that of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-33</a>, but the form in this instance is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel, and meets us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>. The "stony heart" is that which is "hardened" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>) against all impressions of repentance, to all natural or spiritual aspirations of the good. So <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> speaks of those who had made their hearts "harder than an adamant stone." So we may remember, by way of illustration, that Burns says of the sin of impurity that "it hardens a' within," that "it <span class="accented">petrifies</span> the feeling." Ezekiel had seen enough of that stoniness in others, perhaps had, at times, felt it in himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they may walk in my statutes,</span> etc. Out of the new spirit there was to grow the new life - a life of righteousness and obedience, as in worship, so also in the acts of man's daily life and his dealings with his neighbours. So, and not otherwise, could the actual  relation of Jehovah correspond to the ideal, as it had been declared of old (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>;  <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-22.htm">1 Samuel 12:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>). This, for Ezekiel, was the crowning blessedness of all, as it had been that of earlier and contemporary prophets (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>). To that thought he returns again and again, as to the anchor of his hope (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-11.htm">Ezekiel 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-14.htm">Ezekiel 27:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-28.htm">Ezekiel 36:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-23.htm">Ezekiel 37:23, 27</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-21.htm">Ezekiel 11:21</a></div><div class="verse">But <i>as for them</i> whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as for them</span>, etc. We note the peculiar phraseology. The <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> of the people walks not simply after <span class="cmt_word">their detestable things</span>, but after the <span class="cmt_word">heart</span> of those things. There is, as it were, a central unity in the evil to which they unite themselves, just as the heart of man turns to the heart of God when the two are in their ideal relation to each other. For those who did this, whether in Jerusalem or among the exiles, there was the prospect of a righteous retribution. The words close the message which Ezekiel heard in the courts of the temple in his visions, but which he was to deliver (ver. 25) to them of the Captivity.

Currey mentions, but without a reference, a Jewish tradition that the Shechinah, or glory cloud, remained there for three years, calling the people to repentance. What is here recorded may trove suggested the thought of <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>. We may remember that it was from this spot that Christ "beheld the city, and wept over it" (<a href="../../par/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41</a>); that from it He, the true Shechinah, ascended into heaven. Here, perhaps, the dominant thought was that it remained for a time to direct the work of judgment.

The teaching by "the visions of God" ceases, and that of direct message or symbolic acts is resumed. In each case the point aimed at was the same. The people who heard the one or saw the other were to be taught how utterly groundless was the hope that Jerusalem could hold out against its enemies. The interval between the two was probably a short one, and the new teaching, we may conjecture, had its starting point in the prophecies of a speedy deliverance which were current both at Jerusalem and among the exiles at Babylon.

"Bag and baggage," all the household goods which an exile could take with him (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11, 34</a> may supply an illustration), were to be brought out in broad daylight and piled up opposite his door. Then in the <span class="cmt_word">twilight</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">in the dark</span>, and so in vers. 7, 12) he was to go forth, not by the door of his house, but by breaking through the wall (with such walls as those of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-11.htm">Ezekiel 13:11</a> the process would not be difficult), as a man might do who was escaping secretly from a city through the gates of which he dared not pass (ver. 5), and was to start with his travelling chattels upon his shoulder. Lastly (ver. 6), as the strangest feature of all, he was to go forth <span class="cmt_word">with his face covered</span>, as one who wished to avoid recognition, as one also who could not see one step of the way before him. This, it is intimated, would startle even the most careless, and in this way he would become, as he had been before in like symbolic acts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4, 5</a>.), as Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>) had been before him, <span class="cmt_word">a sign unto the house of Israel.</span>

It was not till night had passed to morning that he was able to answer the question which the exiles asked him, <span class="cmt_word">What doest thou!</span> At last the answer came. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?</div><div class="comm">

Possibly he on the whole avoided it, as having fallen into discredit through its constant use by the false prophets (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23</a>:83-38), and preferred the formula of "the word of Jehovah." As interpreted by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>, the "prince" is Zedekiah. Possibly Ezekiel avoided the title "king," as seeing in him one who was a ruler <span class="accented">de facto</span>, but not a king <span class="accented">de jure.</span> The facts related in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a> exactly correspond with the symbolic act. Zedekiah and his men of war escape from the city by night, "by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls," probably enough with faces covered, as David's was in his flight (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>), to avoid detection, or as a sign of mourning, and through some freshly made exit from the palace. The further significance of the covered face is found in the fact that Zedekiah was blinded at Riblah by Nebuchadnezzar's orders, and from that time could not see the ground on which he trod. Those who see in every Old Testament prediction nothing but a prophecy <span class="accented">ex eventu</span> infer from this that this section of Ezekiel was written after the destruction of Jerusalem. I do not take that view, and place it in close connection with the preceding chapters. We note in ver. 11 the peculiar phrase," I am <span class="accented">your</span> sign." Ezekiel, in what he does in the presence of the exiles, is figuring that which, before long, will come to pass in Jerusalem. They were to go forth into captivity as he had gone. <span class="cmt_word">For they shall remove,</span> the Revised. Version gives, <span class="accented">they shall go into exile.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-11.htm">Ezekiel 12:11</a></div><div class="verse">Say, I <i>am</i> your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove <i>and</i> go into captivity.</div><div class="comm">

The prediction of ver. 12 is reiterated with emphasis. Zedekiah shall be in Babylon, yet shall not see. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10. 7:2; 8:2) relates that Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah, finding an apparent discrepancy in the words that he should not see Babylon, and those of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), hardened himself in his unbelief. There is no reason, however, for supposing that Josephus had access to any other records than the books of the two prophets, and his narrative looks rather like an imagined history of what might have been. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">And I will scatter toward every wind all that <i>are</i> about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will scatter.</span> The capture of the king would naturally be followed by the dispersion of his adherents, some of whom would fall by the sword, while a few (Hebrew, <span class="accented">men of number, i.e.</span> easily counted) would escape to some neighbouring country, where they might hope to find a refuge. There they would have to tell their tale of shame, and to let the heathen know that Jehovah was thus punishing their abominations (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-22.htm">Ezekiel 14:22, 23</a>). The prophecy ends with the familiar formula, <span class="cmt_word">They shall knew that I am the Lord.</span>

One conscious burst of inspiration came to an end, and was followed, after a time, by another. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eat thy bread with quaking,</span> etc. No special stress is to be laid on the fact that only bread and water are named. The prophet is not dwelling now on the scarcity of food in the besieged city, as he had done in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-17</a>, but on the fear and terror which should haunt the lives of the besieged. Here again we can scarcely doubt that, as in ver. 11, Ezekiel was a sign to those among whom he lived. Outwardly and visibly he was seen after his strange flitting, cowering in a corner, as one hunted down and dreading pursuit, with every look and gesture of extremest terror. This was to be the portion of those who escaped and whose life was "given them for a prey." The strange act was to be explained to "the people of the land," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the exiles among whom Ezekiel lived. The short prediction ends with the usual formula. There is another interval, and then another inspiration.

Compare the language of the Baptist (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>), of our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>), of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>). For the true prophet there is always a near fulfilment, though there may be also an ultimate and more complete reality of which that is the pledge and earnest. The "vision" shall not fail; every <span class="accented">word</span> (so in the Hebrew) shall become a reality.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a></div><div class="verse">For I <i>am</i> the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - The thought of ver. 93 is reiterated with emphasis. <span class="cmt_word">The rebellious house,</span> whether at Tel-Abib or in Jerusalem (probably the word is used with special reference to the former), should see the word of Jehovah fulfilled in their own days.

In this case (ver. 27) we trace a slight modification in the language of the gainsayers. They recognize Ezekiel both as a seer and a prophet. They do not say that his vision "faileth." They content themselves with throwing the fulfilment into the distant future. Their thought is that of the proverb which has been ascribed to more than one king or statesman, <span class="accented">Apres moi le deluge.</span> To these his answer is nearly in the same terms as before. Still harping on the offensive word, he tells them that nothing that he has spoken shall be "prolonged."

So the false prophets were crafty, laid waste the vineyard of the Lord of hosts (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>), made their profit out of the ruin of Israel, and made that ruin worse. The 'Reineke Fuchs,' in satirizing the monks and priests of the sixteenth century under the same comparison, presents a curious, though probably unconscious,  analogue. In <a href="../../par/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29</a> wolves appear as the types of the false prophet.

What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of my people.</span> The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (<a href="../../par/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (<a href="../../par/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the "life" of the true Israel (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. <a href="../../par/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the "<span class="accented">my</span> people" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the "<span class="accented">thy</span> people" used in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the <span class="cmt_word">land of Israel</span> such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared.

Some scheme is devised, an Egyptian alliance or the like, to which the people look for safety. It is, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, a "slight wall," such as was used for partition walls inside houses. They make it do duty as an outside wall (<span class="accented">kir</span> in ver. 12). It has no sure "footings," and materials and workmanship are alike defective. The false prophets would smear it over <span class="cmt_word">with untempered</span> mortar (the Hebrew word is found only here and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-28.htm">Ezekiel 22:28</a>, and is probably an example of Ezekiel's acquaintance with the technical vocabulary of his time) - with a stucco or plaster, which is hardly better than whitewash (compare the "whitened" or plastered wall or sepulchre of <a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-44.htm">Luke 11:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a>), used to hide its detects and give it a semblance of solidity.

And when the disaster comes men will turn to those who professed to be master builders and repairers of the breach, with derision, and ask, "Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed?" And then men shall see that through all this it is Jehovah's hand that has been working.

The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), and had been followed by Deborah (<a href="../../par/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14-20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (<a href="../../par/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href="../../par/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (<a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the <i>women</i> that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls!

In both cases there are the difficulties inseparable from the fact that he had seen what he describes, and that we have not; and that he uses words which were familiar enough then, but are now found nowhere else. so that (as in the case of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-10.htm">1 Corinthians 11:10</a>) we have to guess their meaning. The picture which he draws of a false prophetess is obviously taken from the life, and the dress, we can scarcely doubt, was one that belonged to her calling. The word for "sew" meets us in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-7.htm">Genesis 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>; and the English is an adequate rendering. For the word rendered "pillows," the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, the Vulgate <span class="accented">pulvilli</span> (equivalent to "cushions"). The word here obviously denotes an article of dress, something fastened to the arms. For <span class="cmt_word">arm-holes</span> <span class="accented">read joints of the two hoods</span>, which may mean either knuckles, wrists, or (as in the Revised Version) elbows. Possibly these may have been, like the phylacteries of <a href="../../par/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a>, cases containing charms or incantations, and used as amulets. Something analogous to, if not identical with, these ornaments, is found in the "seeress wreaths," and "divining garments" of Cassandra (AEsch., 'Agamemnon,' 1237-1242), and in the "garlands" or "fillets" of the Pythian priestess in AEsch., 'Eumeu.,' 39. By some writers (Havernick) the word has been taken, as, perhaps, in the Authorized Version, for "pillows" in the larger sense, either literally as used in wanton luxury, like the "tapestry" of <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, or figuratively, like the "wall" of the preceding section, for counsels that lulled the conscience into the slumber of a false security. Strangely enough, the Hebrew noun rendered "arm-holes" has the pronominal suffix "<span class="accented">my</span> arms<span class="accented"></span>," or "<span class="accented">my</span> hands." Keil accepts this rendering, and explains it as meaning that the prophetesses sought to "bind the arms," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to restrain the power of Jehovah. On the whole, it is safer to follow Ewald and Hitzig, as I have done above. <span class="cmt_word">Make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature.</span> The word for "kerchiefs" is again unique, but is, perhaps, a variant of the word in <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, and rendered "wimples" in the Authorized Version. There is a fair consensus of interpretations that it means, as "kerchief" means, some covering for the head, a veil that hangs down over it, like the Spanish mantilla. Its use is, perhaps, explained by the words that follow, which suggest that the veils were not worn by the prophetesses themselves, but by those who came to consult them. The former had, as it were, a whole wardrobe of such veils adapted to persons of various heights, so that in all cases it shrouded their whole form. We may, perhaps, read between the lines the thought that their utterances, like their veils, were adapted to suit every age and every taste. Analogous usages present themselves in the <span class="accented">tallith</span> of later Judaism, and the veil worn by the Roman augurs. Ezekiel paints, we may believe, what he had seen. And in those veils he had seen a net cast over the victims of the false prophetesses, a snare from which they could not escape. <span class="cmt_word">Will ye hunt,</span> etc.? The question (that form is preferable to the affirmative of the margin of the Revised Version) is one of burning indignation. Omitting the words, "that come" (which have nothing in the Hebrew corresponding to them), the second clause will run, "Will ye make your own souls live?" and the question is explained by what follows. The prophetesses were living upon the credulity of the victims over whom they cast their nets.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a></div><div class="verse">And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear <i>your</i> lies?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will ye pollute me</span>, etc.? rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">ye have profaned</span>, the interrogative form not being continued in the Hebrew. The prophet dwells with scorn on the miserable pay for which the prophetesses were guilty of so great a sin. Not for rewards of divination, like those of Balsam (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a>), but for gifts like those bestowed on the harlot or the beggar (l <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">for handfuls of barley and pieces of bread</span> - they plied their wretched trade. For examples of the lower gifts in kind offered to prophets, compare those of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-8.htm">1 Samuel 9:8</a>), of Jeroboam's wife (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>), the false prophets in <a href="../../par/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>. And they did this in direct opposition to the will of Jehovah. They "slew," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> drew on to destruction, the souls that were meant for life. They "saved the souls alive," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "their own, which were worthy of death." That was the outcome of their "lying" divinations.

So the threat that follows, that the amulets should be torn off and the veil rent, is practically equivalent to the promise that the victims should be "delivered out of the snare of the fowler" (<a href="../../par/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>).

In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> we have "the elders of Judah," and it is possible that there were two groups in the Population of the town, and that these represented Israel as distinct from Judah - a deputation, as it were, from the earlier exiles.

The sin of the inquirers was that they had set up idols (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>, Ezekiel's favourite word; see note on Ezekiel 6:4) in their hearts. The LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>,"thoughts of their hearts," as if to express this.

The "at all" represents the emphatic iteration of the verb in the Hebrew. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">Numquid interrogatus respondebo eis</span>? gives a fair paraphrase.

But there is no sufficient ground for the margin, "Turn <span class="accented">others</span>," the objective suffix being the "faces" of the following clause. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30, 32</a> the verb is used by itself. The prophet's call is to a direct personal repentance, not to the work of preaching that repentance to others.

It is probable that some such proselytes were found among the exiles of Tel Abib. <span class="cmt_word">I the Lord will answer him</span> <span class="cmt_word">by myself,</span> etc. This, as has been seen, was probably the right reading in ver. 4. What it means is that, instead of a spoken answer by the mouth of the prophet, there should be an answer in the discipline of life, in the immediate utterance through the conscience, which was the voice of God. The inquirer who came with unconfessed and unrepented hankerings after the worship of other gods deserved and would receive no other answer.

The distinction was seldom, if ever, present to the mind of the Old Testament, or indeed of the New Testament, writers. It is Jehovah who sends the "lying spirit" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-20.htm">1 Kings 22:20 -23</a>. It is he who in the latter days shall send men "strong delusions" that they shall believe a lie (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). In both cases it is implied that the delusion is a righteous punishment, is indeed the natural, because the divinely appointed, punishment of the sin. <span class="accented">Populus vult decipi et decipiatur</span>, but the very deception is a means for undeceiving them.

What follows presents a striking parallelism to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15.htm">Jeremiah 15</a>:l, 2. There also we have the "four sore judgments," the declaration that not even the presence of Moses and Samuel would avail to save the people. They were obviously selected by Jeremiah as examples of the power of intercession (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>). Ezekiel's selection of names proceeds on a different footing. He chooses exceptional instances of saintliness that had been powerless to save the generation in which they lived; perhaps, also, such as were well known, not only in the records of Israel, but among other nations. Noah had not saved the evil race before the Flood; Job had not saved his sons (<a href="../../par/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18</a>); Daniel, though high in the king's favour, had not been able to influence Nebuchadnezzar to spare the people of Judah and Jerusalem. The mention of this last name is significant, as showing the reputation which even then Daniel had acquired. There is no shadow of evidence for the view of some commentators that an older Daniel is referred to. Had there been such a person, eminent enough to be grouped with Noah and Job, there would surely have been some mention of him in the Old Testament. In ver. 13, for <span class="cmt_word">the land</span>, read "<span class="accented">a</span> land."

For Ezekiel, as for Isaiah, there is the thought of a "remnant that shall return" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). It has been questioned whether "the ways and the doings" which are to bring comfort to men's minds are those of the evil past or of the subsequent repentance. I incline to the view that they include both. Men should see at once the severity and the goodness of Jehovah. His punishments had not been arbitrary nor excessive. They had also been as a discipline leading men to repentance. In each of those facts there was a ground of comfort for men who asked the question, which Abraham asked of old, "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). In either aspect men will recognize that God has not done without cause all that he has done. In this way the prophet seeks, as others have done since, to justify the ways of God to man. Ezekiel's word for "remnant" is, it may be noted, not the same as Isaiah's, its primary significance being "these that <span class="accented">escape</span>." Ezekiel does not quote the earlier prophet, though his thoughts are in harmony with him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The prophet's mind had apparently been dwelling, after the close of his previous utterance, on the imagery of earlier writers, in which Israel had appeared as the vine of Jehovah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), and to which he himself refers again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-10.htm">Ezekiel 19:10</a>. He saw how men might pervert that image to their own destruction. And he expands the parable, as our Lord does in <a href="../../par/john/15.htm">John 15</a>. Men might dwell, perhaps were actually dwelling, on the thought that they were branches of the true vine, and therefore could not perish. He exposes the groundlessness of that hope in tones of scornful sarcasm. If the vine did not bear fruit, or if it only brought forth wild grapes, then its special excellence was gone, and it challenged comparison with other trees only as a timber tree, and what was its worth as such? If Israel was not true to its vocation, it was poorer and weaker than the heathen nations round it. So far the general thought is clear. In dealing with details, we note that the words in italics, "or than," should disappear, and that the words should stand as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">What is the vine more than any tree, the vine branch which is among the trees of the forest?</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-3.htm">Ezekiel 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will <i>men</i> take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall wood be taken thereof,</span> etc.? As a timber tree, then, the vine was confessedly valueless.

For the unfruitful vine branch these remained the doom of being cast into the fire (<a href="../../par/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>). What was its worth when it was half burned at either end and in the middle? What would Israel be fit for when it had been laid low by the "fire" of God's judgment? Probably the vivid picture of the charred branch points to the successive judgments which had fallen first on the ten tribes, then on Judah, and lastly on Jerusalem itself. The word "trespass" may refer either to the general guilt of the people, or to the last crowning crime of Zedekiah's rebellion. I rather incline to the latter, the noun being in the singular.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are ignored by him, and he starts from a time of misery and shame. It is obvious that the only period which corresponds to this is that of the sojourn of Israel as an oppressed and degraded people in the land of Goshen. He paints, with a Dantesque minuteness, the picture of a child just born, abandoned by its mother and neglected by all others from the very moment of its birth. It lies unwashed and foul to look upon. No woman's care does for it the commonest offices of motherhood. <span class="cmt_word">For to supple</span>, read,  with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">to cleanse.</span> The practice still met with in the East of rubbing the newborn child with salt may have rested partly on sanitary grounds (Jerome, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> Galen, 'De San.,' 1:7), partly on its symbolic meaning (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>). When this was done, the child was wrapt in swaddling clothes (<a href="../../par/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>), but these too were wanting in the picture which Ezekiel draws. The whole scene may have been painted from the life. Such a birth may well have been witnessed during the march of the exiles, when the brutality of their Chaldean drivers allowed no halt, and the child was left to perish of neglect, and the thought may then have flashed across Ezekiel's mind that the pity which he felt for the deserted infant was a faint shadow of that which Jehovah had felt for Israel in the degradation of their heathen bondage. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - For <span class="cmt_word">to the loathing of thy person,</span> read, with the Revised Version<span class="accented">, for that thy person was abhorred.</span>

The marvel of that unlooked for pity is emphasized by the iteration of the word of mercy, <span class="cmt_word">Live</span>. The commentary of the Chaldee Targum is sufficiently curious to be quoted: "And the memory of my covenant with your fathers came into my mind, and I was revealed that I might redeem you, because it was manifest to me that ye were afflicted in your bondage, and I said unto you, 'I will have compassion on you in the blood of circumcision,' and I said unto you, 'I will redeem you by the blood of the Passover'" (Rosenmuller). The thought underlying this strange interpretation is that blood might be the means of life as well as of pollution, and in that thought there is a significance at once poetical and profound, almost, as it were, anticipating the later thoughts that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>), that we make our robes white in the blood of the Lamb (<a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). There is no reason, however, for believing that such thoughts were present to the prophet's mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-7.htm">Ezekiel 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent ornaments: <i>thy</i> breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas thou <i>wast</i> naked and bare.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The tenses should be in the simple historic past: <span class="cmt_word">I caused; thou didst increase and wax great; thou attainedst,</span> and so on (Revised Version).

So Vulgate, <span class="accented">mundus muliebris.</span> Here, however, the external adorning comes in vers. 10, 11, and instead of the plural we have the dual. Hitzig is, perhaps, right in taking the phrase to refer to tide beauty of the cheeks, which are themselves the ornaments of the golden prime of wroth. The LXX., following either a different reading or paraphrasing, gives, "to cities of cities." The two clauses that fellow point to the most obvious signs of female puberty. For <span class="cmt_word">whereas,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">yet</span>, etc., as describing, not as the Authorized Version seems to do, a state which trod passed away, but one which still continued even when full-grown girlhood would have demanded clothing.

It has been commonly taken as meaning the skin of some animal - badger, dolphin, or porpoise, or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">seal</span>, which was used for sandals. All the older versions, however, take it as a word of colour, the LXX. giving <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> ("dark red"); Aquila, Symmachus, and Vulgate, <span class="accented">ianthino</span> ("violet").

The word so translated in <a href="../../par/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22</a> is that which we find here and elsewhere for "fine linen." Silk, in the strict sense of the term, had its birthplace in China, and there is no evidence that even the commerce of Tyre extended so far; but the context points to some fine texture of the lawn or muslin kind, like the Coan vestments of the Greeks. So the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, as though it were made of fine hair; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">subtilia.</span> It is significant that three out of the four articles specified are prominent (as the references show) in the description of the tabernacle and the priestly dress, in <a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28, 39</a>.

The Chaldee Targum continues its spiritual interpretation: "I gave the ark of my covenant to be among you, and the cloud of my glory overshadowed you, and the angel of my presence led you in the way." And, if we assume, as we legitimately may assume, that Ezekiel, above all others, the prophet of symbolism, did not fill up his picture with details which were only meant to fill it up, this seems a not unfitting interpretation.

And it was, so to speak, a promiscuous whoredom. Every passer by was admitted to her embraces, every nation that offered its alliance had its worship recognized and adopted. In the closing words of extremest scorn, the prophet adds, his it was. Jerusalem was, as I have said, the Messalina of the nations.

The words imply that the shrines upon them were decked with hangings of many coloured tapestry, presenting an appearance like that of a Persian carpet, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, of the image of the Asherah. Those hangings were, as in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-16.htm">Proverbs 7:16</a>, the ornaments of the adulterous bed. The "high places" are named first, as the earliest form of idolatry. The like things <span class="cmt_word">shall not come</span>. The words are obscure, and the text probably corrupt. As they stand, they seem to say that the world would never again witness so shameful an apostasy. The Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sicut non est factum neque futurum est</span>; extends the comparison to the past. Possibly, though it is a strain upon the grammar, the words may be rendered, "such things should not come, should not be."

This, as afterwards in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-41.htm">Ezekiel 23:41</a>, was the crowning aggravation of the guilt. The very gifts of God, designed for his worship, were prostituted to that of his rivals. The "oil" is that of <a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23-25</a>, perfumed and set apart for sacred uses. The act of covering the idol was, as in ver. 8, the symbol of the marriage union. In the sweet savour  we have the familiar phrase of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. The scene brought before us is that of a sacrificial feast, in which cakes of flour, honey, and oil were eaten whilst incense was offered. So we have the "adored liba" of Virgil, 'AEneid,' 7:109, or more fully in Tibullus, 'Eleg.,' 1:7, 53, 54, the "thuria honores," the "liba ... dulcia melle." <span class="cmt_word">Thus it was,</span> etc. As in ver. 16, the description seems to rouse an instinctive abhorrence in the prophet's mind, which finds utterance in this form: "Yes, it was even so." The words are, however, taken by the LXX., Vulgate, and Luther as opening the following verse: "And it came to pass that."

It will be noticed that the words, "the fire," are in italics, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are not in the Hebrew, the verb "to pass through" having acquired so technical a meaning that it was enough without that addition. This, as the closing words indicate, was the crowning point. As though idolatry in itself was a small matter, it was intensified by infanticide.

The interjectional parenthesis, half anathema and half lamentation, looks forward rather than backward. Up to this point Ezekiel had dwelt on the forms of idolatry which were indigenous to Canaan and the nations in immediate contact with it. Now he enters on the later forms of evil which had been adopted from more distant nations. We pass from the time of Solomon to that of Ahaz and Manasseh.

The words, <span class="cmt_word">great of flesh,</span> may point, as we interpret the parable, to the supposed strength of the stout and stalwart soldiers, the chariots and horses of the Egyptians, but possibly also may be a euphemism for the mere animal vigour which stimulated passion.

The husband was bound to provide his wife with food and raiment (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>).

In the words, <span class="cmt_word">were ashamed of thy lewd way</span>, the prophet points, as his master had done (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-10.htm">Jeremiah 2:10</a>), to the fact that other nations had at least been faithful to their inherited religion, while Judah had forsaken hers.

The latter probably followed under Ahaz as a consequence of the former, and afterwards spread through the influence of the Assyrian colonists - each nation with its own deities - in Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>). The culture of the queen of heaven  (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-17.htm">Jeremiah 44:17</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the Assyrian Ishtar, may have had this origin. <span class="cmt_word">Yet couldest not be satisfied.</span> One is reminded once more of Juvenal ('Sat.,' 6:130).

Other nations, like Tyre and Zidon, had risen to prosperity and eminence through their intercourse with foreigners. To Judah it had brought only subjection and the payment of tribute. She had given gifts to all her lovers, instead of receiving from them the rewards of her shame. She was as the adulterous wife who forsakes her husband, and gives what belonged to him to strangers. The conduct of Ahaz in stripping the Temple of its gold and silver to pay tribute to Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>), gives an apt illustration of what the prophet means (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>).

The (or a) holy city, the perfection of beauty, should be as "some forlorn and desperate castaway" (comp. <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1-10</a> for a companion picture).

They speak of the satisfaction of the jealous husband's righteous anger, and therefore of a completed punishment. And vet that thought was, as the sequel shows (vers. 53, 60-63), the beginning of hope for the future, as the prophet thought of his people. For here the forms of punishment were not final The daughter of Zion survived the stoning, the sword, and the burning. And so, when wrath had done its work of retribution, it might become corrective and purgatorial. The injured husband, in the bold anthropomorphic language of the parable, would be no more angry. The Lord God of Israel would remember his covenant, and forgive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-43.htm">Ezekiel 16:43</a></div><div class="verse">Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these <i>things</i>; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon <i>thine</i> head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast not remembered</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>).

Ezra (<a href="../../par/ezra/5-12.htm">Ezra 5:12</a>) uses the same word, there rendered "provoke." Had Ezekiel's use of it stamped it as the right word for confession? <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt not commit,</span> etc. The Vulgate follows a reading which gives, "I have not done according to thy lewdness," etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the guilt had deserved a greater punishment. The Revised Version margin gives, "Hast then not committed," etc.? The word for "lewdness" ("lewd way" in ver. 27) is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it eleven times. Elsewhere it is translated "wickedness" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "lewdness" in <a href="../../par/judges/20-6.htm">Judges 20:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-27.htm">Jeremiah 13:27</a>.

Reading between the lines, we find something like an anticipation of St. Paul's thought that Jehovah was the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews (<a href="../../par/romans/3-29.htm">Romans 3:29</a>). The Hittites and Sodom and Samaria, to whom she is compared, had all alike been guilty of unfaithfulness to their husbands. Their idolatry was therefore, like hers, an act of apostasy. Jehovah was their husband also, their children were his children (ver. 21). He claimed them as his own, had entered with them also into a relation which, though less close than that with Israel, was as that of the husband to the wife. The thought expands, as we shall see, in the sequel of the chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a></div><div class="verse">And thine elder sister <i>is</i> Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy right hand, <i>is</i> Sodom and her daughters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - No very adequate reason appears for the assignment of the respective ages of the two sisters. Historically, Sodom, as the oldest representative of evil, would have seemed to claim precedence. Samaria may have had this position assigned to it as more closely connected with Judah. The left and right hands indicate respectively a position to the north and south of Jerusalem, the observer of the heavens looking east, as, we may note, the temple did (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>).

The prophet fixes on the point which made Sodom a luxurious and sensual city, the graver evil being just hinted at in the word <span class="cmt_word">abominations</span>, and as the outcome of the evil tendencies. So in like manner the special sin of Samaria, the worship of the calves, is not named, but taken for granted. (<span class="cmt_word">For fulness of bread</span>, see <a href="../../par/proverbs/30-9.htm">Proverbs 30:9</a>: <a href="../../par/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-12.htm">Deuteronomy 8:12</a>.) Prosperity and luxury in her case, as in that of other wealthy cities, hardened the hearts of men against the poor and needy. There was probably a sufficient reason for the omission which has been pointed out. It was wiser to dwell on the sins which were common to the two cities rather than on the vice which, though it existed in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>), was probably not prevalent there. <span class="cmt_word">As I saw good</span>; better, <span class="accented">according to what I saw.</span> The word "good" is not in the Hebrew, and the words apparently refer to <a href="../../par/genesis/18-21.htm">Genesis 18:21</a>.

Sodom and Samaria might claim a verdict of acquittal ("justify," in its technical sense) as compared with Judah. They had not  presented, as she had done, a confluence of all the worst idolatries. The words find something like an echo in our Lord's teaching <a href="../../par/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>.

It may be questioned whether the word for <span class="cmt_word">judged</span> is ever used of an acquittal. The point of the sentence is that Judah condemned those who were less guilty than herself (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-23</a>).

But all that follows in the chapter shows that what is meant is a promise of restoration, not for Judah only, but also for her less guilty sisters. Ezekiel sees a far off hope for his own nation, and he cannot limit the mercy of God in bringing them also, as she was to be brought, to repentance. For them also punishment was a means to an end beyond itself, corrective, and not merely retributive. The language of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/19-23.htm">Isaiah 19:23</a>-2.5) as to Egypt and Assyria presents a striking parallel, and may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-54.htm">Ezekiel 16:54</a></div><div class="verse">That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - Even in that restoration, however, there should be a further clement of humiliation.

The most tenable interpretation may be expressed by a paraphrase. The name of Sodom was not in the lips of Judah in the days of her prosperity. It was too vile for utterance, except as a byword of reproach. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9, 10</a>) had in vain reminded her that she had made herself like them. Her fate could never be like theirs. Now, in the day of the discovery (the uncovering, or laying bare) of her wickedness (ver. 57), she had learnt the lesson. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a></div><div class="verse">Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of <i>thy</i> reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all <i>that are</i> round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 57.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thy reproach</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">the reproach.</span> The words point primarily to the disasters, not of Judah, but to those that fell on the cities of Syria and Philistia - the Assyrian and Chaldean invasions. (For the grouping of the two nations as enemies of Judab, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-12.htm">Isaiah 9:12</a>; and for special acts of hostility, <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-37.htm">2 Kings 15:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>; and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18, 19</a>.)

The righteousness of God had been adequately vindicated. And so, if the punishment led to repentances, there was room for pardon (compare for the thought, <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a></div><div class="verse">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 59, 60.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will even deal with thee,</span> etc. The law of retribution is stated in all its fulness. Falling back upon the idea of the espousals of Israel in the covenant made at Sinai (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-42.htm">Leviticus 26:42, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11, 12</a>), Ezekiel presses home on Judah the thought that she had broken that covenant. She must suffer as though it no longer existed. She must "dree her weird" and "accept her punishment" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>). And then Jehovah would show that he had not really been unmindful of his part in it. He bad remained faithful in spite of her unfaithfulness. And so in the day of her repentance he will not only renew it, but will give it a higher and more permanent character. The "new covenant" of which Ezekiel's master had spoken (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>) should not be as the old, decaying and vanishing away, but should be foreverlasting. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-60.htm">Ezekiel 16:60</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.</div><div class="comm">

Ezekiel represents that memory as quickened to a new intensity in the very hour of restoration. The shame which it brings with it is necessary as the safeguard of the new blessedness. <span class="cmt_word">Thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger.</span> It is significant that, as in the Revised Version, both the adjectives are now in the plural. What was possible for Sodom and Samaria was possible also, as for the cities more immediately connected with them, so also for other nations of the heathen world. They to should be admitted into fellowship, not now as alters, but as <span class="cmt_word">daughters</span>, acknowledging, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, her superiority. The limitation which follows, <span class="cmt_word">not by thy covenant,</span> asserts, as it were, the restored prerogative of Judah, much as St. Paul asserts it in <a href="../../par/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>. Those who are within the covenant of Israel, including, as it does, those who are the heirs of the faith of Abraham as well as his children according to the flesh, are in a closer relation to him than others who share in what have been called (the phrase, perhaps, taking its origin from these very words) the "uncovenanted mercies" of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-62.htm">Ezekiel 16:62</a></div><div class="verse">And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I <i>am</i> the LORD:</div><div class="comm">

Revised Version, <span class="accented">when I have forgiven thee.</span> The Hebrew verb so rendered is that which expresses the fullest idea of forgiveness, and which marked both the "day" and the "sacrifice" of atonement (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). This, according to the received etymology, was represented in the mercy seat, the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, of the ark of the covenant (<span class="accented">cophereth</span>, as from <span class="accented">caphar</span>). So the prophet closes with the wet, Is of an eternal hope what had at first seemed to heal up to nothing but eternal condemnation. How far the prophet expected a literal fulfilment in the restoration of Sodom and Samaria, we cannot define with certainty; but the ideal picture of the purification of the waters of the Dead Sea in ch. 47:8 suggests that it entered into his vision of the future. For us, at least, it is enough to pass from the temporal to the eternal, from the historical to the spiritual, and to see in his words the noblest utterance of mercy prevailing over judgment - a <span class="accented">theodikea</span>, a "vindication of the ways of God to man," like that of <a href="../../par/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33-36</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/17.htm"><title>Ezekiel 17 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/17.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/17.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/17-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/16.htm" title="Ezekiel 16">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 17 <a href="../ezekiel/18.htm" title="Ezekiel 18">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-1.htm">Ezekiel 17:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">

This he describes as a "riddle" (same word as the "dark speeches" of <a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>, the "hard questions" of <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>). It will task the ingenuity of his hearers or readers to interpret it, and so he subjoins (vers. 12-24) the interpretation. That interpretation enables us to fix the occasion and the date of the prophecy. It was the time when Zedekiah was seeking to strengthen himself against Nebuchadnezzar by an Egyptian alliance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; A great eagle with great wings, longwinged, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the highest branch of the cedar:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - The eagle with <span class="cmt_word">great wings and long pinions</span> (Revised Version) probably the golden eagle, the largest species of the genus - stands for Nebuchadnezzar, as it does in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-22.htm">Jeremiah 49:22</a>. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a> the "ravenous bird" represents Cyrus. Possibly the eagle head of the Assyrian god Nisroch (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-38.htm">Isaiah 37:38</a>) may have impressed the symbolism on Ezekiel's mind. A doubtful etymology gives "the great eagle" as the meaning of <span class="accented">Nisroch</span>. The <span class="cmt_word">divers colours</span> indicate the variety of the nations under the king's sway (<a href="../../par/daniel/3-4.htm">Daniel 3:4</a>: 4:1). If the cedar was chosen to t,e the symbol of the monarchy of Judah, then it followed that Lebanon, as the special home of the cedar, should take its place in the parable. Possibly the fact that one of the stateliest palaces of Solomon was known as the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17, 21</a>) may have made the symbolism specially suggestive. The word for highest branch is peculiar to Ezekiel (here and in ver. 22). The branch so carried off was carried into "a land of traffick" (Hebrew, LXX., and Vulgate, "a land of Canaan," the word being generalized  in its meaning, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-29.htm">Ezekiel 16:29</a>), <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to Babylon, as pre-eminently the merchant city of the time. This, of course, refers to Nebuchadnezzar's deportation of Jeconiah and the more eminent citizens of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-8.htm">2 Kings 24:8-15</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-4.htm">Ezekiel 17:4</a></div><div class="verse">He cropped off the top of his young twigs, and carried it into a land of traffick; he set it in a city of merchants.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5</a></div><div class="verse">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed <i>it</i> by great waters, <i>and</i> set it <i>as</i> a willow tree.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed of the land</span> is Zedekiah, who was made king by Nebuchadnezzar in Jeconiah's place. The imagery of the <span class="cmt_word">willow</span> (the Hebrew word occurs here only) seems suggested by Ezekiel's surroundings. No tree could stand out in greater contrast to the cedar of Lebanon than the willows which he saw growing by the waters of Babylon (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-2.htm">Psalm 137:2</a>, though the word is different). The choice of the willow determined the rest of the imagery, and the <span class="cmt_word">fruitful field</span> and the great or "many" (Revised Version) waters represent Judah, possibly with reference to its being in its measure a "land of brooks of waters," of "fountains and depths," of "wheat and barley and wine" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-12</a>). The kingdom of Zedekiah, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, was left with sufficient elements for material prosperity. That prosperity is indicated in ver. 6 by the fact that the willow became a vine. It was of "low stature," indeed, trailing on the ground. It could not claim the greatness of an independent kingdom. Its branches turned toward the planter (ver. 6); its roots were under him. It acknowledged, that is, Nebuchadnezzar's suzerainty, and so, had things continued as they were, it might have prospered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a></div><div class="verse">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</div><div class="comm">

We note the absence of the "long pinions" and the "many colours" of the first eagle. Egypt was not so strong, nor did her sway extend over so great a variety of nations as Babylon. To that eagle the vine bent its roots, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, as in ver. 15, Zedekiah courted the alliance of Pharaoh (Apries), and trusted in his chariots, he was to <span class="cmt_word">water the vine,</span> which so turned to him <span class="cmt_word">from the beds of her plantation</span> (Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-8.htm">Ezekiel 17:8</a></div><div class="verse">It was planted in a good soil by great waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Ezekiel repeats, as justifying Nebuchadnezzar's action, that his first intention had been to leave Zedekiah under conditions which would have given his kingdom a fair measure of prosperity. The vine might have borne fruit. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a></div><div class="verse">Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither? it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The prophet, like his contemporary Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>), like his predecessor Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-7</a>), is against this policy of an Egyptian alliance. The question which he asks, as the prophet of Jehovah, implies an answer in the negative. The doom of failure was written on all such projects. The <span class="cmt_word">he</span> of the next question is not Nebuchadnezzar, but indefinite, like the French <span class="accented">on</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For leaves of her spring,</span> read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">fresh springing leaves</span>; or, <span class="accented">the leaves of her sprouting</span>. The Authorized Version and the Revised Version of the last clause seems to assert that Nebuchadnezzar would have an easy victory. It would not take <span class="cmt_word">great power or much</span> <span class="cmt_word">people</span> to pluck up such a vine from its roots. I adopt, with Keil and Hitzig, the rendering, <span class="accented">not with great power or much people will men be able to raise it up from its roots</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. no forces of Egypt or other allies should be able to restore Judah from its ruins. Its fall was, for the time, irretrievable (comp. ver. 17).

The east wind is, as elsewhere, the symbol of scorching and devastating power (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-12.htm">Ezekiel 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/27-21.htm">Job 27:21</a>). For <span class="cmt_word">furrows</span>, read <span class="accented">beds</span>, with Revised Version.

Ezekiel, after the pause implied in ver. 11, now becomes its interpreter. And that interpretation is to be addressed to the "rebellious house" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3, 6</a>) among whom he lived. Probably even among the exiles of Tel-Abib there were some who cherished hopes of the success of the Egyptian alliance, and of the downfall of the power of Babylon as its outcome. The tenses are better in the indefinite past - "came," "took," "brought," and so on in ver. 13. The history of Jeconiah's deportation and of Zedekiah's oath of fealty (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>) is recapitulated. He dwells specially on the fact that the <span class="cmt_word">mighty of the land</span> had been carried off with Jecoutah. It was Nebuchadnezzar's policy to deprive the kingdom of all its elements of strength - to leave it "bare." Even masons. smiths, and carpenters were carried off, lest they should be used for warlike preparations (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>). It could not lift itself up. It was enough if "by keeping its covenant" it was allowed to stand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">And hath taken of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and hath taken an oath of him: he hath also taken the mighty of the land:</div><div class="comm">

See for the time of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>), of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28, 29</a>), of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>), of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>: 36:9). <span class="cmt_word">Shall he prosper?</span> What had been asked in the parable is asked also, in identical terms, in the interpretation. Ezekiel presses home the charge of perfidy as well as rebellion. Like Jeremiah, he looks on Nebuchadnezzar as reigning by a Divine right. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place <i>where</i> the king <i>dwelleth</i> that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, <i>even</i> with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Ezekiel repeats the prediction of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>. The prison in Babylon, under the eye of the king against whom he had  rebelled; this was to be the outcome-of the alliance with Egypt. The prophecy was probably written when the hopes of Zedekiah and his counsellors were at their highest point, when the Chaldeans had, in fact. raised the siege in anticipation of the arrival of the Egyptian army (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-11</a>). Ezekiel, like Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.), declared that the relief would be but temporary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shall Pharaoh with <i>his</i> mighty army and great company make for him in the war, by casting up mounts, and building forts, to cut off many persons:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By casting up mounts,</span> etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">when they cast up mounts</span>. The words describe the strategical operations, not of the Egyptians against the Chaldeans, but of the Chaldeans, when they recovered from their first alarm, against Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a>). The Egyptians, Ezekiel predicts, would be powerless to prevent that second and decisive siege. In vers. 18, 19 the prophet emphasizes the fact that this would be the just punishment of Zedekiah's perfidy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a></div><div class="verse">Seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, when, lo, he had given his hand, and hath done all these <i>things</i>, he shall not escape.</div><div class="comm">

There, in Babylon, the real character of his sin should be brought home to the conscience of the blind and captive king. What follows in ver. 21, in like manner, reproduces <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14, 15</a>.

The cedar of Israel is not dead. Jehovah would, in his own time, take the highest branch, tender and slender though it might be, the true heir of David's house, and deal with it far otherwise than the Chaldean conqueror had done. The latter had carried off the branch to the "land of traffick" - <span class="accented">sc</span>. had brought Jeconiah to Babylon. Jehovah would plant his branch upon the "mountain of the height of Israel" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>). It was not to be as a willow in a low place, but to flourish, true to its origin as a cedar, so that "all fowl of every wing" should dwell in the shadow of its branches (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3-9</a>, where the same imagery is used of Assyria; and <a href="../../par/matthew/13-32.htm">Matthew 13:32</a>). As with like prophecies in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a> and Isaiah 53:2 (where the "tender one" finds a parallel), the words paint an ideal never historically realized, but finding a partia1 fulfilment in Zerubbabel and the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple, merging in the still unfulfilled vision of the kingdom of the Messiah and the restoration of Israel. To Ezekiel, as to other prophets, it was not given to know the times and the seasons, or even the manner of the fulfilment of his hopes; and when he uttered the words, the vision may have seemed not tar off, but nigh at hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-23.htm">Ezekiel 17:23</a></div><div class="verse">In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</div><div class="comm">

The thought, which reproduces that of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7</a>, finds an echo in <a href="../../par/luke/1-51.htm">Luke 1:51, 52</a>. Another echo of the words may, perhaps, be traced in the "green tree" and the "dry" of <a href="../../par/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>. Here then, also, as in ch. 16, the utterance which begins with judgment, ends in mercy. Behind the picture of the blind, discrowned king the prophet sees that of the Divine ideal King in the fulness of his majesty and power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm"><title>Ezekiel 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/17.htm" title="Ezekiel 17">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 18 <a href="../ezekiel/19.htm" title="Ezekiel 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-1.htm">Ezekiel 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">The word of the LORD came unto me again, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What mean ye, that ye use this proverb,</span> etc.? Another and entirely different section opens, and we see at once from what it started. Ezekiel had heard from the lips of his countrymen, and had seen its working in their hearts, the proverb (already familiar to him, it may be, through <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29</a>) with which they blunted their sense of personal responsibility. They had to bear the punishment of sins which they had not committed. The sins of the fathers were visited, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>, upon the third and fourth generations. Manasseh and his people had sinned, and Josiah and his descendants and their contemporaries had to suffer for it. The thought was familiar enough, and the general law of the passages above referred to was afterwards applied, as with authority, to what was then passing (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). Even Jeremiah recognized it in <a href="../../par/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-4.htm">Jeremiah 15:4</a>, and was content to look, for a reversal of the proverb, to the distant Messianic time of the new covenant (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-29.htm">Jeremiah 31:29-31</a>). The plea with which Ezekiel had to deal was therefore one which seemed to rest on the basis of a Divine authority. And that authority was confirmed by the induction of a wide experience. Every preacher of righteousness in every age has to warn the evil doer that he is working evil for generations yet unborn, to whom he transmits his own tendencies, the evil of his own influence and example. It is well that he can balance that thought with the belief that good also may work in the future with a yet wider range and mightier power (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Authority and experience alike might seem to favour the plea that <span class="cmt_word">the fathers had eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth were set on edge.</span> Ezekiel was led, however, to feel that there was a latent falsehood in the plea. In the depth of his consciousness there was the witness that every man was personally responsible for the things that he did, that the eternal righteousness of  God would not ultimately punish the innocent for the guilty, he had to work out, according to the light given him, his vindication of the ways of God to man, to sketch at least the outlines of a theodicy. Did he, in doing this, come forward as a prophet, correcting and setting aside the teaching of the Law? At first, and on a surface view, he might seem to do so. But it was with him as it was afterwards with St. Paul He "established the Law" in the very teaching which seemed to contradict it. He does not deny (it would have been idle to do so) that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> affect those children for evil. What he does is to define the limits of that law. And he may have found his starting point in that very book which, for him and his generation, was the great embodiment of the Law as a whole. If men were forbidden, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>, to put the children to death for the sins of the fathers; if that was to be the rule of human justice, - the justice of God could not be less equitable than the rule which he prescribed for his creatures. It is not without interest to note the parallelism between Ezekiel and the Greek poet who was likest to him, as in his genius, so also in the courage with which he faced the problems of the universe. AEschylus also recognizes ('Agam.,' 727-756) that there is a righteous order in the seeming anomalies of history. Men might say, in their proverbs, that prosperity as such provoked the wrath of the gods, and brought on the downfall of a "woe insatiable;" and then he adds - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"But I, apart from all,<br />Hold this my creed alone."</span> And that creed is that punishment comes only when the children reproduce the impious recklessness of their fathers. "Justice shines brightly in the dwellings of those who love the right, and rule their life by law." Into the deeper problem raised by the modern thought of inherited tendencies developed by the environment, which itself originates in the past, it was not given to Ezekiel or AEschylus to enter.

There, among the, people in whom he was manifesting his righteousness for the education of mankind, it should be seen to have no force whatever. The thought was an essentially heathen thought - a half-truth distorted into a falsehood. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, all souls are mine</span>, etc. The words imply, not only creation, ownership, absolute authority, on the part of God, but, as even Calvin could recognize (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>), "a paternal affection towards the whole human race which he created and formed." Ezekiel anticipates here, and yet more fully in ver. 32. the teaching of St. Paul, that "God willeth that all men should be saved" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</span> The sentence, though taken from the Law, which ordered capital punishment for the offences named, cannot be limited to that punishment. "Death" and "life" are both used in their highest and widest meaning - "life" as including all that makes it worth living, "death" for the loss of that only true life which is found in knowing God (<a href="../../par/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-9.</span> - The verses that follow are noticeable as forming one of the most complete pictures of a righteous life presented in the Old Testament. It ads characteristic of Ezekiel that he starts from the avoidance of sins against the first table of the commandments. <span class="cmt_word">To eat upon the mountains</span> was to take part in the sacrificial feasts on the places, of which he had already spoken (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>; comp. 22:9; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>). The words, <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his eyes,</span> as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, implied every form of idolatrous adoration. The two sins that follow seem to us, as compared with each other, to stand on a very different footing. To Ezekiel, however, they both appeared as <span class="accented">mala prohibita</span>, to each of which the Law assigned the punishment of death (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), each involving the dominance of animal passions, in the one case, over the sacred rights of others; in the other, over a law of self-restraint which rested partly on physical grounds, the act condemned frustrating the final cause of the union of the sexes; partly, also, on its ethical significance. The prominence given to it implies that the sin was common, and that it brought with it an infinite degradation of the holiest ties. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman,</div><div class="comm">

The garment which the debtor had pledged as a security was to be restored to him at night. Such a law implied, of course, the return of the pledge in the morning. It was probably often used by the debtor for his own fraudulent advantage, and it was a natural consequence that the creditor should be tempted to evade compliance with it. The excellence of the man whom Ezekiel describes was that he resisted the temptation. Hath spoiled none by violence. Comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-1.htm">Leviticus 6:1-5</a>, which Ezekiel probably had specially in view. The sin, common enough at all times (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>), would seem to have been specially characteristic of the time in which Ezekiel lived, from the king downwards (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>). As contrasted with the sin, there was the virtue of generous almsgiving (<a href="../../par/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5-7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a></div><div class="verse">He <i>that</i> hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, <i>that</i> hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath not given forth his money upon usury.</span> The word "usury," we must remember, is used, not, as with us, for exorbitant interest above the market rate, but for interest of any kind. This was allowed in commercial dealings with foreigners (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>), but was altogether forbidden in the case of loans to Israelites (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>: <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-2.htm">Isaiah 24:2</a>). The principle implied in this distinction was that, although it was, on strict principles of justice, allowable to charge for the use of money, as for the use of lands or the hire of cattle, Israel, as a people, was under the higher law of brotherhood. If money was to be lent at all, it was to be lent as to a brother in went (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-42.htm">Matthew 5:42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>), for the relief of his necessities, and not to make profit. A brother who would not help a brother by a loan without interest was thought unworthy of the name. The ideal of the social polity of Israel was that it was to consist of a population of small freeholders, bound together by ties of mutual help - a national friendly society, rather than of traders and manufacturers; and hence the whole drift of its legislation tended to repress the money making spirit which afterwards became specially characteristic of its people, and ate like a canker into its life. The distinction between the two words seems to be that "usury" represents any interest on money; and "increase," any profit on the sale of goods beyond the cost of production, as measured by the maintenance of the worker and his family. To buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest was not to be the rule in a nation of brothers, and it was wiser to forbid it altogether rather than to sanction what we call a "reasonable rate" of interest or profit. <span class="cmt_word">Hath executed true judgment</span>. The last special feature in the description of the righteous man is that he is free from the judicial corruption which has always been the ineradicable evil of Eastern social life (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-11.htm">Ezekiel 18:11</a></div><div class="verse">And that doeth not any of those <i>duties</i>, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - The word "duties" is not in the Hebrew, but is legitimately introduced as expressing Ezekiel's meaning, where the mere pronoun by itself would have been ambiguous. In English we might say, "He does these things: he does not do those;" but this does not fall in with the Hebrew idiom.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now, lo, <i>if</i> he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now, lo!</span> etc. The law of personal responsibility had been pressed on its darker side. It is now asserted in its brighter, and that with the special emphasis indicated in its opening words. The proverb of the "sour grapes" receives a direct contradiction. The son of the evil doer way take warning by his father's example, and repent, as Ezekiel exhorted those among whom he lived to do. In that case he need fear no inherited or transmitted curse. <span class="cmt_word">He shall surely live;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">living he shall live.</span> That truth came to Ezekiel as with the force of a new apocalypse, and it is obviously "exceeding broad," with far-reaching consequences both in ethics and theology.

The words are better taken, with the LXX., Vulgate, Revised Version, and most critics, as a single question, <span class="accented">Why doth not the son bear</span>, etc.? What is the explanation of a fact which seemingly contradicts the teaching of the Law? The answer to the question seems at first only an iteration of what had been stated before. The son repents, and therefore does not bear his father's iniquity. A man is responsible for his own sins, and for those only. To think otherwise is to think of God as less righteous than man.

The question is carried further into the relations between the past and the present of the same man, between his old and his new self. And in answering that question also Ezekiel becomes the preacher of a gospel. The judgment of God deals with each man according to his present state, not his past. Repentance and conversion and obedience shall cancel, as it were, the very memory of his former sins  (Ezekiel's language is necessarily that of a hold anthropopathy), and his transgressions shall not be mentioned unto him (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-9.htm">Isaiah 64:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-34.htm">Jeremiah 31:34</a>). Assuming the later date of <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, the last three utterances have the interest of being those of nearly contemporary prophets to whom the same truth had been revealed.

Ezekiel's anticipations of the gospel of Christ take a yet wider range, and we come at last to what had been throughout the suppressed premise of the argument. To him, as afterwards to St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and St. Peter (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), the mind of God was presented as being at once absolutely righteous and absolutely loving. The death of the wicked, the loss, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of true life, for a time, or even forever, might be the necessary consequence of laws that were righteous in themselves, and were working out the well being of the universe; but that death was not to be thought of as the result of a Divine decree, or contemplated by the Divine mind with any satisfaction. If it were not given to Ezekiel to see, as clearly as Isaiah seems to have seen it, how the Divine philanthropy was to manifest itself, he at least gauged that philanthropy itself, and found it fathomless.

Here it appears as a ground, for fear and watchfulness. The "grey-haired saint may fail at last," the apostle may become a castaway (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>), and the righteousness of a life may be cancelled by the sins of a year or of a day. Whether there was an opening for repentance, even after that fall, the prophet does not say, but the law that a man is in spiritual life or death according to what he is at any given moment of his course, seems to require the extension of the hope, unless we assume that the nature of the fall in the case supposed fetters the freedom of the will, and makes repentance impossible (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-20.htm">2 Peter 2:20</a>).

The former telling nearly the same story under a different imagery, the latter a reproduction of the same imagery, with a slightly different application. Lamentation. The same word as that used in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>. The whole chapter finds a parallel in Jeremiah's review of Josiah's successors  (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-10.htm">Jeremiah 22:10-30</a>). It is noticeable that the princes are described as being <span class="cmt_word">of Israel.</span> The LXX. gives the singular, "the prince," and Hitzig and Ewald adopt this reading, applying it to Zedekiah.

So the Vulgate gives <span class="accented">didicit viduas facere</span>; and Keil adopts that meaning here, "he knew, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. outraged, the widows of Israel." The Revised Version admits it in the margin. The two words for "widows" and "palaces" differ in a single letter only, and there may have been an error in transcription. On the whole, I adhere to the Authorized Version and Revised Version (text). Currey explains, "He knew (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. eyed with satisfaction) his palaces," from which he had ejected their former owners, as his father Jeboiakim had done (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15, 16</a>). Ewald follows the Targum in a various reading of the verb, and gets the meaning, "he destroyed its palaces." Interpreting the parable, we have Jehoiachin described as alarming Nebuchadnezzar and the neighbouring nations by his activity, and therefore carried off to Babylon as Jehoahaz lad been to Egypt. The young lion was to roar in chains, not on the "mountains of Israel."

No satisfactory meaning can be got out of the words, the nearest being "in thy life, thy freshness," the sap of the vine being thought of as its blood; and critics have been driven to conjectural readings or renderings. The Jewish interpreters, Targum, Rashi, Kimchi, and margin of Revised Version, give, "in thy likeness," <span class="accented">sc</span>.

Other theories are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the years are reckoned from the era of Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar ( <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>), dating from his throwing off the sovereignty of Assyria, and giving here the date  <span class="date">B.C. 595</span> (Michaelis, Rosenmuller, Ewald, and others); but against this it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> that there is no evidence that that era was in use in Ezekiel's time, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> that he nowhere else uses a double historical chronology. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That the years are reckoned from the discovery of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-14.htm">2 Chronicles 34:14</a>), as a turning point or era in the history of Judah (Targum, Theodoret, Jerome, Havernick), which would again bring us to  <span class="date">B.C. 595</span>. This view is, however, open to the same objections as (1). We have no proof that the Jews ever reckoned from that event, and Ezekiel did not want, here or elsewhere, another point to reckon from, as far as his people's history was concerned, than the captivity of Jehoiachin. <span class="cmt_word">In the fourth month</span>. Both here and in ver. 2 the months are probably reckoned from Abib, or Nisan, the month of the Passover, with which the Jewish year began (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-7.htm">Esther 3:7</a>), so that the fourth month, known by later Jews as Tammuz, would bring us to June or July. <span class="cmt_word">Among the captives</span> (literally, <span class="accented">the captivity</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>by the river of Chebar.</span> By most earlier commentators the Chebar has been identified with the Chaboras of the Greeks (now the <span class="accented">Khabour</span>), which rises in Upper Mesopotamia, at <span class="accented">Ras-el-Ain</span>, and falls into the Euphrates at Carcesium, a city which modern geographers distinguish from the Carchemish of the Old Testament. Recent critics, however (Rawlinson, Smend, and others), have urged that this was too far north to be in the "land of the Chaldeans" (ver. 3), or Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), and have suggested that the Chebar of Ezekiel is the <span class="accented">Nahr-Malcha</span>, or Royal Canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the greatest of that king's irrigation works, to which, therefore, the name Chebar (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> uniting) would be appropriate. The identification of Chebar with the labor of <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>, to which the  ten tribes had been deported (whether, with Rawlinson, we think of that river as identical with the Chaboras, or still further north, near an affluent of the Tigris of the same name), must, for like reasons, be rejected. The two names are, indeed, spelt differently, with initial letters that do not interchange. <span class="cmt_word">The heavens were opened.</span> The phrase, not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, appears in <a href="../../par/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-51.htm">John 1:51</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-11.htm">Acts 10:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-1.htm">Revelation 4:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Visions of God.</span> The words admit of three interpretations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Great, or wonderful, visions; as in the "mountains of God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>), the "cedars of God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-10.htm">Psalm 80:10</a>), the "river of God" (<a href="../../par/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> visions sent from God; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> actual theophanies or manifestations of the Divine glory, of these <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is most in harmony with what follows, here and elsewhere, on the phrase (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>). Such a theophany constituted in his ease, as in that of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>), Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a>), Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-14</a>), his call to the office of a prophet. The visions may be thought of as manifested to his waking consciousness in an ecstatic state, and are thus distinguished from the dreams of sleep (comp. <a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> for the distinction between the two - "visions" belonging to the young, and "dreams" to the old). The visions of Balaam, seen in a "trance," but with his "eyes open" (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3, 4</a>), and of St. Paul, "whether in the body or out of the body" he could not tell (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2, 3</a>), present suggestive parallels.

It was for him and for his fellow exiles a natural starting point to reckon from. It would have been, in one sense, as natural to reckon from the beginning of Zedekiah's reign, as Jeremiah does (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1, 2</a>), but Ezekiel does not recognize that prince - who was, as it were, a mere satrap under Nebuchadnezzar - as a true king, and throughout his book systematically adheres to this era (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ezekiel 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). About this time, but a year before, the false prophets of Judah were prophesying the overthrow of Babylon and the return of Jeconiah within two years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3</a>), and the expectations thus raised were probably shared by many of Ezekiel's companions in exile, while he himself adhered to the counsels of the leter which Jeremiah had sent (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1-23</a>) to the Jews of the Captivity. To one who felt himself thus apart from his brethren, musing over many things, and perhaps perplexed with the conflict of prophetic voices, there was given, in the "visions of God" which he relates, the guidance that he needed. They did not break in, we may well believe, suddenly and without preparation on the normal order of his life. Like other prophets, he felt, even before his call, the burdens of his time. and vexed his soul with the ungodly deeds of these among whom he lived.

The phrase stands, as elsewhere, for the conscious inspiration which made men feel that Jehovah had indeed spoken unto them, and that they had a message from him to deliver.

The "hand" of the Lord is the natural symbol of his power, and the phrase seems to be used to add to the consciousness of inspiration, that of a constraining, irresistible power. Ezekiel continually uses it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness <i>was</i> about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A whirlwind came out of the north</span>. What, we ask, was the meaning of this symbolism? In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13, 14</a> a like symbol is explained as meaning that the judgments which Judah was to suffer were to come from the north, that is, from Chaldea, upon the prophet's countrymen. Here the prophet is himself in Chaldea, and what he sees is the symbol, not or calamities, but of the Divine glory, and that explanation is, accordingly, inapplicable. Probably the leading thought here is that the Divine presence is no longer in the temple at Jerusalem, It may return for a time to execute judgment (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1, 19, 20</a>), and may again depart (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), but the abiding glory is elsewhere, and the temple is as Shitoh had been of old (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60</a>). Ezekiel was looking on the visible symbol of what had been declared in unfigurative language by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>). That the north should have been chosen rather than any other quarter of the  heavens is perhaps connected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with <a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a>, where it appears as the region of "fair weather," the unclouded brightness of the "terrible majesty" of God; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, where "the sides of the north" are the symbols of the dwelling place of God. For the Jews this was probably associated with the thought of the mountain heights of Lebanon as rising up to heaven (Currey, on <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary'), or with the fact that the "north side" of Zion (<a href="../../par/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>), as the site of the temple, was the "dwelling place of the great King." Parallels present themselves in the Assyrian hymns that speak of the "feasts of the silver mountains, the heavenly courts" (as the Greeks spoke of Olympus), "where the gods dwell eternally" ('Records of the Past,' 3:133), and this ideal mountain was for them, like the Meru of Indian legend, in the farthest north. So, in the legendary geography of Greece, the Hyperborei, or "people beyond the north," were a holy and blessed race, the chosen servants of Apollo (Herod., 4:32-36: Pindar, 'Pyth.,' 10:4; AEsch., 'Choeph.,' 373). Possibly the brilliant coruscations of an Aurora Borealis may have led men to think of it as they thought of the glory of the dawn or the brightne<span class="accented">ss</span> of the lightning, as a momentary revelation of the higher glory of the throne of God. (For the "whirlwind" as the accompaniment of a Divine revelation, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/38-1.htm">Job 38:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">A great cloud,</span> etc. So far the signs of the approaching theophany were like those on Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 18</a>) and Horeb (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With a fire infolding itself;</span> the Revised Version margin gives <span class="accented">flashing continually.</span> The Authorized Version suggests the thought of a globe of fire darting its rays through the surrounding darkness. <span class="cmt_word">The colour of amber;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the eye.</span> The Hebrew word for "amber" (chashmal) occurs only here and in ver. 27 and ch. 8:2. It is almost absolutely certain that it does not mean what we know as "amber." The LXX. and Vulgate give <span class="accented">electrum</span>, and this, in later Greek and Latin authors, has "amber" for one of its meanings. Primarily, however, it was used for a metallic substance of some kind, specifically for a compound four parts of gold and one of silver (Pithy, 'Hist. Nat.,' 23:4, s. 23). Some such compound is probably what we have to think of here, and so the description finds a parallel in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>. This, in its ineffable brightness, is seen in the centre of the globe of fire. One may compare Dante's vision of the Divine glory ('Paradise,' 33:55).

What he sees is, in fact, a highly complicated development of the cherubic symbols, which might well appear strange to him. It is possible (as Dean Stanley and others have suggested) that the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, the winged bulls and lions with human heads, which Ezekiel may have seen in his exile, were elements in that development. <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of a man.</span> This apparently was the first impression.

The noun is probably used as including the lower part of the leg, and what is meant is that the legs were not bent, or kneeling. What we may call the bovine symbolism appears at the extremity, and the actual foot is round like a calf's. The LXX. curiously enough gives "their feet were <span class="accented">winged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>)." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Burnished brass.</span> Probably a shade less brilliant, or more ruddy, than the <span class="accented">electrum</span> of ver. 4 (see note there).

The prophet seems to describe each detail in the order in which it presented itself to him. What he next sees is that each of the four forms has two hands on each of its four sides. Nothing could supersede that symbol of activity and strength. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-9.htm">Ezekiel 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Their wings <i>were</i> joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their wings were joined,</span> etc. As interpreted by vers. 11 and 24, two of the wings were always down, and when the living creatures moved, two were extended upwards, so that their tips touched, and were in this sense "joined." When at rest, these were let down again (ver. 24). <span class="cmt_word">They turned not,</span> etc. We note the emphasis of the threefold iteration of the fact (vers. 12, 17). None of the four forms revolved on its axis.  The motion of what we may call the composite quadrilateral was simply rectilinear. Did the symbolism represent the directness, the straightforwardness, of the Divine energy manifested in the universe? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for the likeness,</span> etc. The Revised Version rightly strikes out the comma after "lion." The human face meets the prophet's gaze. On the right he sees the lion, on the left the ox, while the face of the eagle is behind. What did the symbols mean? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The human face represents the thought that man, as made "after the image of God" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>), is the highest symbol of the Eternal. So long as we remember that it is but a symbol, anthropomorphism is legitimate in thought, and appropriate in visions; though, like theriomorphism, it becomes perilous, and is therefore forbidden (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-17.htm">Deuteronomy 4:17</a>) when it takes concrete form in metal or in stone. So Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9, 13</a>) sees the "Ancient of Days" and "one like unto a son of man;" and St. John's vision (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>) represents the same symbolism. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The lion had been the familiar emblem of sovereignty, both in the temple of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>) and in his palace (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-20.htm">1 Kings 10:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-18.htm">2 Chronicles 9:18, 19</a>). So, in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>, it is the symbol of the kingly power of Judah, and appears with a yet higher application in <a href="../../par/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>; while, on the other hand, it represents one of the great monarchies of the world in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>. Its modern heraldic use in the arms of England and elsewhere presents yet another analogue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The ox had appeared, as here, so also in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-25.htm">1 Kings 7:25, 44</a>, in company with the lion, notably in the twelve oxen that supported the "sea" or "laver" in the temple. Here also we have a kind of sovereignty - the natural symbol of a strength made subservient to human uses. Both the lion and the ox, as we have seen, may have become familiar to Ezekiel as a priest ministering in the temple or as an exile. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The eagle was, in like manner, though not taking its place in the symbolism of the temple, the emblem of kingly power, and is so employed by Ezekiel himself in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3, 7</a>; while in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a> the lion has eagle's wings (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-11.htm">Isaiah 46:11</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>). In Assyrian sculpture Nisroch (the name is cognate with the Hebrew for "eagle," <span class="accented">nesher</span>) appears as an eagle-headed human figure, and is always represented as contending with or conquering the lion and the bull (Layard, 'Nineveh,' 2:458, 459). The facts suggest the inference <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ezekiel may have seen this symbol; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that over and above the general thought that all the powers of nature are subject to the government of God, there was also the more specific thought that the great kingdoms of the earth were but servants of his, to do his pleasure? The reproduction of the fourfold form, with the variation already noticed, in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>, is every way suggestive, and it is, at least, a natural inference that the symbols had acquired a new significance through the new truths that had been revealed to the seer of Patrons; that the human face may have connected itself with the thought of the Son of man who shared in the glory of the Father; the ox with that of his sacrifice; the lion with that of his sovereignty over Israel, as the Lion of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/revelation/5-5.htm">Revelation 5:5</a>); the eagle with that of his bearing his people as on eagles' wings, into the highest heavens (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-11.htm">Deuteronomy 32:11</a>) The patristic interpretation, which finds in the four living creatures the symbols of the four evangelists (an interpretation by no means constant or unvarying - the lion being sometimes identified with St Matthew, and the man with St. Mark, and conversely, while the ox and the eagle are uniformly assigned to St. Luke and St. John respectively), must be considered as the play of a devout imagination, but not as unfolding the meaning of either Ezekiel or St. John. In the later Jewish tradition the four forms are assigned, taking Ezekiel's order, to the tribes of Reuben, Judah, Ephraim, and Dan, as the "standards" (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-2.htm">Numbers 2:2</a>) which they generally bore when encamped in the wilderness; but this is obviously outside the range of the prophet's thoughts.

The description passes on to the originating force of the movement of the mysterious forms. The Hebrew noun may mean "breath," "wind," or "spirit," the meanings often overlapping one another. Here the higher meaning is probably the true one. The "Spirit" (as in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-7.htm">Isaiah 40:7, 13</a>; and in Ezekiel himself, <span class="accented">passim</span>) is the Divine Source of life in all its forms, especially in its highest form, moral, intellectual, spiritual. It is this which gave unity and harmony to the movements of the "living creatures," as it gives a life, harmony, and unity to all the manifold manifestations of the might of God of which they were the symbols. (On "they turned not," see note on ver. 9.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-13.htm">Ezekiel 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance <i>was</i> like burning coals of fire, <i>and</i> like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like burning coals of fire, etc</span>. It may not be amiss to note the fact that the phrase throughout the Bible denotes incandescent wood. The nearest approach to its  use by Ezekiel is in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 13</a>. For "lamps," read, with the Revised Version, "torches." Here the vision of Ezekiel, in which the living creatures were thus incandescent, bathed, as it were, in the fire that played around them, yet not consumed, followed in the path of previous symbols - of the burning bush (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), of the pillar of fire by night (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-22.htm">Exodus 13:22</a>), of the fire on Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), of the "fire of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1-3</a>), and the "fire of God" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-12.htm">2 Kings 1:12</a>). Speaking generally, "fire," as distinct from "light," seems to be the symbol of the power of God as manifested against evil. "Our God is a consuming Fire" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The red light of fire has in it an element of terror which is absent from the stainless white of the eternal glory, or from the sapphire of the visible firmament. <span class="cmt_word">Lightning</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/4-5.htm">Revelation 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/8-5.htm">Revelation 8:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-19.htm">Revelation 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-18.htm">Revelation 16:18</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-15.htm">Ezekiel 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold one wheel,</span> etc. As the prophet gazed, yet another marvel presented itself - a "wheel" was seen. It is "by" or "beside" (Revised Version) the living creatures, and "for each of the four faces thereof" (Revised Version); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as the next verse states definitely, there were four wheels. We may compare the analogues of the "wheels" of fire in the theophany of <a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, and the chariot of the cherubim in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-16.htm">Ezekiel 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">The appearance of the wheels and their work <i>was</i> like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work <i>was</i> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Like unto the colour of a beryl.</span> The Hebrew for "beryl" (<span class="accented">tarshish</span>) suggests that the stone was called, like the turquoise, from the region which produced it. Here and in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a> the LXX. leaves it untranslated. In <a href="../../par/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a> we find <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-9.htm">Ezekiel 10:9</a> and Ezekiel 28:13 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> carbuncle. It is obvious, from this variety of renderings, that the stone was not easily identified. Probably it was of a red or golden color, suggesting the thought of fire rather than the pale green of the aquamarine or beryl (see especially <a href="../../par/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They four had one likeness,</span> etc. A closer gaze led the prophet to see that there was a plurality in the unity. For the one "wheel" we have four; perhaps, as some have thought, two wheels intersecting at right angles, perhaps, one, probably seen behind, perhaps also below, each of the living creatures. They are not said actually to rest upon it, and the word "chariot" is not used as it is in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-18.htm">1 Chronicles 28:18</a>. They would seem rather to have hovered over the wheels, moving simultaneously and in full accord with them. The "wheels" obviously represent the forces and laws that sustain the manifold forms of life represented by the "living creatures" and the "Spirit." In each case the number four is, as elsewhere, the symbol of completeness. <span class="cmt_word">A wheel in the midst of</span> (<span class="accented">within</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">a wheel;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with an inner and outer circumference, the space between the two forming the "ring" or felloe of ver. 18. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-17.htm">Ezekiel 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">When they went, they went upon their four sides: <i>and</i> they turned not when they went.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they went,</span> etc. The meaning seems to be that the relative position of the wheels and the living creatures was not altered by motion. On "they turned not," see note on ver. 9. All suggests the idea of orderly and harmonious working. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-18.htm">Ezekiel 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings <i>were</i> full of eyes round about them four.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As for their rings,</span> etc. The "rings" or "felloes" of the wheels impressed the prophet's mind with a sense of awe, partly from their size, partly from their being "full of eyes." These were obviously, as again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-12.htm">Ezekiel 10:12</a>, and in the analogues of the "stone with seven eyes" in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, and the "four beasts [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'living creatures'] full of eyes," in <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>, symbols of the omniscience of God working through the forces of nature and of history. These were not, as men have sometimes thought, blind forces, but were guided as by a supreme insight (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-19.htm">Ezekiel 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The wheels went by them;</span> better, with Revised Version, <span class="accented">beside them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> moving in parallel lines with them. <span class="cmt_word">And when the living creatures went,</span> etc. The truth embodied in the coincident movements of the "living creatures" and the "wheels," is the harmony of the forces and laws of nature with its outward manifestations of might. In the two directions of the movement, onward and upward - <span class="cmt_word">when the living creatures were lifted up</span> - we may see <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the operations of the two when they are within the range of man's knowledge, and, as it were, on the same plane with it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those which are as in a higher region beyond his ken.

For "the spirit of the living creature" (singular, because the four are regarded as one complex whole), the LXX., Vulgate, and Revised Version margin, give "the spirit of life," a rendering tenable in itself, but the contextual meaning of the word is in favour of the Authorized Version and the Revised Version text. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-21.htm">Ezekiel 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">When those went, <i>these</i> went; and when those stood, <i>these</i> stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature <i>was</i> in the wheels.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When those went, these went.</span> The words, strictly speaking, add nothing to the previous description; but the prophet appears to have wished to combine what he  had before said separately, so as to make the picture complete, before passing on to the yet more glorious vision that next met his gaze. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-22.htm">Ezekiel 1:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature <i>was</i> as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">the likeness of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">firmament</span>, etc. The word is the same as that in <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>; cf. 1; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a>. It meets us again in vers. 23, 25, 26, and in 10:1, but does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament. What met the prophet's eye was the expanse, the "body of heaven in its clearness" (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>), the deep intense blue of an Eastern sky. <span class="cmt_word">Like the colour of the terrible crystal,</span> etc. The Hebrew noun is not found elsewhere. Its primary meaning, like that of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is that of "cold," and I incline therefore to the margin of the Revised Version, "ice." Rock crystal, seen, as it is, in small masses, and in its pure colourless transparency, hardly suggests the idea of terror; but the intense brightness of masses of ice, as shining in the morning sun, might well make that impression. Had Ezekiel seen the glories of a mountain throne of ice as he looked up, on his nay from Palestine to Chaldea, at the heights of Lebanon, or Hermon, and thought of them as the fitting symbol of the throne of God? We note, in this connection, the use of "terrible" in <a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22</a> (see note on ver. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-23.htm">Ezekiel 1:23</a></div><div class="verse">And under the firmament <i>were</i> their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Under the firmament,</span> etc. The description must be read as completing that of ver. 11. The two upper wings of the "living creatures" were not only stretched out, but they pointed to the azure canopy above them, not as sustaining it, but in the attitude of adoration. Nature, in all her life phenomena, adores the majesty of the Eternal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a></div><div class="verse">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The noise of their wings,</span> etc. The wings representing the soaring, ascending elements in nature, their motion answers to its aspirations, their sounds to its inarticulate groanings (<a href="../../par/romans/8-26.htm">Romans 8:26</a>) or its chorus of praise. <span class="cmt_word">The noise of great waters</span> may be that of the sea, or river, or torrents. Ezekiel's use of the term in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-7.htm">Ezekiel 31:7</a>, in connection with the cedars of Lebanon, seems in favour of the last. On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/29-3.htm">Psalm 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23</a>, the term is manifestly used for the seas.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a></div><div class="verse">And above the firmament that <i>was</i> over their heads <i>was</i> the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne <i>was</i> the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The likeness of a throne.</span> The greatest glory was kept to the last. High above the azure expanse was the <span class="accented">likeness</span> of a throne (we note the constant recurrence of the word "likeness," nine times in this one chapter, as indicating Ezekiel's consciousness of the vision character of what he saw). The idea of the throne of the great King first appears in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>, is frequent in the Psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>), notably in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>. In the visions of St John (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span>) it is the dominant, central object throughout. <span class="cmt_word">As the appearance of a sapphire stone.</span> The intense blue of the sapphire has made it in all ages the natural symbol of a heavenly purity. Ezekiel's vision reproduces that of <a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>. It appears among the gems of the high priest's breastplate (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-18.htm">Exodus 28:18</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>) and in the "foundations" of <a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>. The description of the sapphire given by Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:9), as "never transparent, and refulgent with spots of gold," suggests lapis lazuli. As used in the Old Testament, however, the word probably means the sapphire of modern jewellery (Braun, 'De Vest. Sacerd.,' p. 630, edit. 1680). <span class="cmt_word">A likeness as of the appearance of a man.</span> The throne, the symbol of the sovereignty of God over the "living creatures" and the "wheels," over the forces and the laws which they represented, is not empty. There was "a likeness as of the appearance" (we note again the accumulation of words intended to guard against the thought that what was seen was more than an approximate symbolism) "of a man." In that likeness there was the witness that we can only think of God by reasoning upward from all that is highest in our conceptions of human greatness and goodness, and thinking of them as free from their present limitations. Man's highest thought of God is that it is "a face like his face that receives him." He finds a humanity in the Godhead. It is noticeable that this preluding anticipation of the thought of the Incarnation, not recognized in the vision of Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>) or Isaiah (Isaiah 6:1), appears prominently in the two prophets of the exile - here and in the memorable Messianic vision of "One like unto the ['a,' Revised Version] Son of man" in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>. What might have been perilously anthropomorphic in the early stages of the growth of Israel, when men tended to identify the symbol with the thing symbolized, was now made subservient to the truth which underlies even  anthropomorphic thought (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:20. 10), it may be noted, dwells on the fact that Ezekiel uses the words, "'haec visio similitudmis gloriae Domini,' ne quis putaret forte eum in his proprie vidisse Deum."

Mercy and love are thought of as over arching all the phenomena of the world and its history, attempering the chastisements which are needed for those with whom that love is dealing.

The last note of time was in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, and eleven months and five days had passed, during which the prophecies of the intervening chapters had been written or spoken. We may note further that it was two years one month and five days after the prophet's call to his work (ch. 1.), and two years and five months before the Chaldeans besieged Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1</a>). The immediate occasion here, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>, was that some of the <span class="cmt_word">elders of Israel</span> bad come to the prophet to inquire what message of the Lord he had to give them in the present crisis. Whether any stress is to be laid on the fact that here the elders are said to be "of Israel," and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a> "of Judah," is doubtful (see note on Ezekiel 14:1). Ezekiel seems to use the two words as interchangeable. Here, however, it is stated more definitely that they came to inquire, probably in the hope that he would tell them, as other prophets were doing, that the time of their deliverance, and of that of Jerusalem, was at hand. Passing into the prophetic state, Ezekiel delivers the discourse that follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-2.htm">Ezekiel 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then came the word of the LORD unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-3.htm">Ezekiel 20:3</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye come to inquire of me? <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As I live, saith the Lord God,</span> etc. The inquirers are answered, but not as they expected. Instead of hearing of the "times and seasons" of the events that were in the near future, the prophet at once enters on his stern work as a preacher. The general principle that determines the refusal to answer has been given in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a></div><div class="verse">Wilt thou judge them, son of man, wilt thou judge <i>them</i>? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou judge them</span>, etc.? The doubled question has the force of a strong imperative. The prophet is directed, as it were, to assume the office of a judge, and as such to press home upon his hearers, and through them upon others, their own sins and those of their fathers. He is led, in doing so, to yet another survey of the nation's history; not now, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, in figurative language, but directly.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up mine hand unto them, saying, I <i>am</i> the LORD your God;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the day that I lifted up mine hand.</span> The attitude was that of one who takes an oath (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>), and implies the confirmation of the covenant made with Abraham.

The <span class="cmt_word">glory of all lands</span> is peculiar to Ezekiel. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-19.htm">Isaiah 13:19</a>) applies the word to Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">In the day <i>that</i> I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which <i>is</i> the glory of all lands:</div><div class="comm">

Here apparently the prophet speaks of that sojourn prior to the mission of Moses. In bold anthropomorphic speech he represents Jehovah as half purposing to make an end of the people there and then, and afterwards repenting. <span class="cmt_word">He wrought for his Name's sake,</span> that the deliverance of the Exodus might manifest his righteousness and might, the attributes specially implied in that Name, to Egypt and the surrounding nations.

A man who kept that Law in its fulness would have life in its fullest and highest sense. He was beginning, however, to recognize, as Jeremiah had (lone (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>), the powerlessness of the Law to give that life without the aid of something higher. The "new covenant" was already dawning on the mind of the scholar as on that of the master. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I <i>am</i> the LORD that sanctify them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them my sabbaths,</span> etc. As in <a href="../../par/exodus/31-12.htm">Exodus 31:12-17</a>, the sabbath is treated as the central sign (we might almost say sacrament) of the Jewish Church, not only as a mark differencing them from other nations, but as <span class="cmt_word">between Jehovah and them</span>, a witness of their ideal relation to each other, a means of making that ideal relation a reality. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a></div><div class="verse">But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which <i>if</i> a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - It is hardly necessary to count up the several instances of rebellion, from the sin of the golden calf onward. Of direct violation of the sabbath we have but two recorded instances (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-27.htm">Exodus 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32</a>); but the prophet looked below the surface, and would count a mere formal observance, that did not sanctify the sabbath, as a pollution of the holy day. (For parallel teaching in the prophets, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-2.htm">Isaiah 56:2-4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21-27</a>; and later on in the history, probably as the result of their teaching, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31-33</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15-22</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Then I said</span>. The history of <a href="../../par/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a> and Numbers 26:65 was probably in Ezekiel's thoughts.

The history of Baal-peor (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3-9</a>) shows how ready they were to pass into act, and <a href="../../par/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25, 26</a> implies a tradition of other like acts during the whole period of the wanderings in the wilderness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-17.htm">Ezekiel 20:17</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.</div><div class="comm">

That utterance also, it is implied, as indeed the Baal-peor history at the close of the forty years showed, fell on deaf ears. Then also there was, once again, in the inevitable anthropomorphic language, a change of purpose, from that of a rigorous judgment to the mercy which prevailed against it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-19.htm">Ezekiel 20:19</a></div><div class="verse">I <i>am</i> the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;</div><div class="comm">

What Ezekiel contemplates, however, as the resolve of Jehovah, is the commutation of the sentence of destruction for that of the dispersion of the people, leaving the time and manner of that dispersion to be determined by his own will. Possibly even in the time of the judges, with its many conquests and long periods of oppression, there were instances of such dispersion, and these, with others that would naturally accompany an invasion like that of Shishak (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-9</a>), not to speak of frequent attacks from Moabites, Ammonites, Philistines, Edomites, and Syrians, may have seemed to the prophet the working out, step by step, of the dispersion which culminated in the deportation of the ten tribes by Shalmaneser, and of Judah and Benjamin by Nebuchadnezzar. Traces of such dispersions before Ezekiel's time meet us in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-59.htm">Psalm 78:59-64</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-10.htm">Zephaniah 3:10, 20</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-24.htm">Ezekiel 20:24</a></div><div class="verse">Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-25.htm">Ezekiel 20:25</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore I gave them also statutes <i>that were</i> not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave them</span> <span class="cmt_word">also statutes that were</span> <span class="cmt_word">not good,</span> etc. The words have sometimes been understood as though Ezekiel applied these terms to the Law itself, either as speaking of what St. Paul calls its "weak and beggarly elements" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>), or as unable to work out the righteousness which it commanded (<a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>), and the language of <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a> and Hebrews 10:1 has been urged in support of this view. One who has studied Ezekiel with any care will not need many words to show that such a conclusion  was not in his thoughts at all. For him the Law was "holy and just and good," and its statutes such that a man who should keep them should even live in them (vers. 13, 21). He is speaking of the time that followed on the second publication of that Law, and what he Says is that the people who rebelled against it were left, as it were, to a law of another kind. The baser, darker forms of idolatry are described by him, with a grave irony, as <span class="cmt_word">statutes</span> and <span class="cmt_word">judgments</span> of another kind, working, not life, but death. Sin became, by God's appointment, the punishment of sin, that it might be manifest as exceeding sinful. So Stephen says of Israel that "God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>). So St. Paul paints the corruptions of the heathen world as the result of God's giving them up to "vile affections" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24, 25</a>). So in God's future dealings with an apostate form of Christianity, the same apostle declares that "God shall send them strong delusions that they should believe a lie" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). <a href="../../par/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> may have been in Ezekiel's thoughts as asserting the same general law. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-26.htm">Ezekiel 20:26</a></div><div class="verse">And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through <i>the fire</i> all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I polluted them through their own gifts</span>. The noun includes all forms of blessing bestowed on Israel - its corn and wine and oil (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-19.htm">Ezekiel 16:19, 20</a>), even its sons and daughters, the fruit of the womb, as well as the increase of the earth. (For the prevalence of Moloch worship, and for the phrase, "pass through," see notes on Ezekiel 16:21.) The sins were to bring desolation as their punishment, and then men would learn to know Jehovah as indeed he is.

The forms of worship include that of the high places, and the thick trees (<a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>) width witnessed the cultus of the Asherah or of Ashtaroth.

At first it was applied to the hill on which some local sanctuary stood (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>), but was gradually extended, after the building of the temple as the one appointed sanctuary, to other places which were looked upon as sacred, and which became the scenes of an idolatrous and forbidden worship. Ezekiel emphasizes his scorn by a conjectural derivation of the word, as if derived from the two words <span class="accented">ba</span> ("go") and <span class="accented">mah</span> ("whither"); <span class="accented">or</span>, perhaps, <span class="accented">What comes?</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a> for a parallel derivation of the word <span class="accented">marones</span>). Taking the words in their ordinary sense, they seem to express only a slight degree of contempt. "What, then, is the place to which you go?" - what is the "whither" to which it leads? But I incline (with Ewald and Smend) to see in the word "go into" the meaning which it has in <a href="../../par/genesis/16-2.htm">Genesis 16:2</a> and Genesis 19:31, and elsewhere, as a euphemism for sexual union. So later the word "Bamah" becomes a witness that those who worship in the high place go there (as in ver. 30) to commit whoredom literally and spiritually. Its name showed that it was what I have called "a chapel of prostitution" (ch. 16:24, 25). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye unto the house of Israel,</span> etc. The words are addressed primarily to the elders who had come to consult the prophet (ver. 1), but through them to all their contemporaries and fellow countrymen. They still in heart and even in deed (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-4.htm">Isaiah 57:4-6, 11</a>, and Isaiah 65:3, as showing the habits of the exiles) clung to the old idolatries. The question for them was whether they would continue to walk in the ways of their fathers. If so, it was true of them, as of the elders, that the Lent to whom they came would not be inquired of by them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-31.htm">Ezekiel 20:31</a></div><div class="verse">For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</div><div class="comm">

If the temple were destroyed, they thought, then the one restraint on the idolatries they loved would be removed. They would be no longer a separate people, and would be free to adopt the cultus of the heathen among whom they lived. If that was not Jehovah's purpose for them, then there must be no destruction of the temple, no dispersion among the nations. They come to Ezekiel to know which of the two alternatives he, as the prophet of Jehovah, has in store, and his answer is that he is bound to nether. They could not abdicate their high position, and would remain under the burden of its responsibilities. Scattered though they might be among the heathen, yet even there the "mighty hand and the stretched-out arm" (we note the phrases as from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>) would hunt them down, and punish them for their iniquities.

He contemplates not a return straight from Babylon to Jerusalem, but a gathering from all the countries in which they had been scattered (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11</a>). When gathered, the whole nation is to be brought into <span class="cmt_word">the wilderness of the peoples,</span>  bordered by many nations. This may probably point to the great Syro-Arabian desert lying between Babylon and Palestine. This was to be to them what the wilderness of Sinai had been in the time of the Exodus. There Jehovah would plead with them face to face, in the first instance as an accuser. (For <span class="cmt_word">face to face,</span> as expressing the direct revelation of Jehovah, see <a href="../../par/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, and elsewhere.)

The chastisement was, for those who accepted it, to do its work by restoring the blessings of the covenant which apostasy had forfeited. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-38.htm">Ezekiel 20:38</a></div><div class="verse">And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - The thought of the shepherd suggests, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/25-33.htm">Matthew 25:33</a>, the separation of the sheep from the goats. The land of the restored Israel was to be a land of righteousness, and the rebels were not to enter into it. Was Ezekiel thinking of those who were thus to die in the "wilderness of the peoples" as a counterpart of those who perished in the forty years of the wandering, and did not enter Canaan? Ver. 36 seems to imply that he was looking for a repetition of that history. The solemn fast kept by Ezra by the river of Ahava (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21-22</a>) may be noted as corresponding, on a small scale, to Ezekiel's expectations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-39.htm">Ezekiel 20:39</a></div><div class="verse">As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter <i>also</i>, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go ye, serve every man his idols,</span> etc. The command comes as with a grave irony. "Be at least consistent. Sin on, if it is your will to sin; but do not make the sin worse by the hypocrisy of an unreal worship, and mix up the name of Jehovah with the ritual of Moloch" (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19, 20</a>). The margin of the Revised Version, with not a few critics (Keil), gives, "but hereafter surely ye shall hearken unto me" ("if not" equivalent to "ye shall," as in the familiar idiom of <a href="../../par/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a>, where "if" is equivalent to "shall not"). So taken, the verse looks forward to what follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a></div><div class="verse">For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - From the earlier stage of the restoration the prophet passes on to its completion. The people have come to the <span class="cmt_word">mountain of the height of Israel</span> (<a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>). Ezekiel sees an Israel that shall at last be worthy of its name, the worship of false gods rooted out forever. The <span class="cmt_word">all of them</span> points to the breaking down of the old division between Israel and Judah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/11-13.htm">Isaiah 11:13</a>). Jehovah would accept the "heave offering" (same word as in Exodus 24:27; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14</a>, <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">al</span>.) and other oblations. The fact that Israel itself is said to be the "sweet savour" (Revised Version) which Jehovah accepts (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>) suggests a like spiritual interpretation of the other offerings, though the literal meaning was probably dominant in the prophet's own thoughts. The nearest approach to a parallelism in a later age is that presented by <a href="../../par/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>; but it is noticeable how there St. Paul avoids any words that imply the perpetuation of the temple and its ritual, and confines himself to the spiritual restoration of his brethren according to the flesh. It was given to him to see, what the prophets did not see, that that perpetuation would frustrate the purpose of the restoration; that the temple and its ritual took their places among the things that "were decaying and waxing old," and were ready to vanish away (<a href="../../par/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a></div><div class="verse">I will accept you with your sweet savour, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be sanctified in you,</span> etc. God is sanctified when he is manifested and recognized as holy (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>). That recognition would be the consequence of the restoration of Israel, for then it would be seen, even by the heathen, that the God of Israel had been holy and just and true in his judgments, and that he seeks to make men partakers of his holiness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-42.htm">Ezekiel 20:42</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country <i>for</i> the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers.</div><div class="comm">

The whole evil past is still remembered after repentance and forgiveness. There is no water of Lethe, such as the Greeks fabled, such as Dante dreamt of as the condition of entering Paradise ('Purg.,' 31:94-105). The self-loathing and humility which grow out of that memory, the acceptance of all the punishment of the past as less than had been deserved, - these are the conditions and safeguards of the new blessedness. Ezekiel teaches us, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span>, that it is possible to conceive of an eternal punishment, the punishment of memory, shame, self-loathing, as compatible with eternal life. So (in ver. 44) the prophet ends what is perhaps, the profoundest and the noblest of his discourses, his "vindication of the ways of God to man."

The Authorized Version follows the LXX., the Vulgate, and Luther. The section has clearly no connection with what has preceded, and, though fragmentary in its character, seems by the words, "set thy face," to connect itself with <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-2.htm">Ezekiel 21:2</a>, and to lead up to it. The words of ver. 45 imply, as always, an interval of silence and repose. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-46.htm">Ezekiel 20:46</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop <i>thy word</i> toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Drop thy word.</span> The verb is  used specially of prophetic utterances (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-2.htm">Ezekiel 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/7-6.htm">Amos 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6, 11</a>), and stands, therefore, in the Hebrew without an object.

The use of the three words where one might have sacrificed is, perhaps, characteristic of Ezekiel's affluence of diction. The LXX. treats all three as proper names, and transliterates them as <span class="accented">Thaiman, Darom</span>, and <span class="accented">N'ageb</span>. Against this region and its inhabitants (they, of course, are the "trees") Ezekiel is directed to utter his words of judgment. The parenthesis in the last sentence gives the key to the prophet's cypher writing. From Ezekiel's standpoint on the Chebar, the whole of Judah is as <span class="cmt_word">the forest of the south</span>. The "green tree," as in <a href="../../par/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1, 2</a>, is the man who is relatively righteous; the "dry tree" is the sinner whose true life is withered; the "fire" the devastation wrought by the Chaldean invaders, as executing the Divine judgment. In our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a> we may probably find an echo of Ezekiel's imagery. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-47.htm">Ezekiel 20:47</a></div><div class="verse">And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All faces from the south to the north,</span> etc. The phrase seems, at first, to pass from the figure to the reality. Possibly, however, <span class="cmt_word">face</span> may stand for "the outward appearance," the leaves and branches, of the trees. "From the south (<span class="accented">Negeb</span>) to the north" takes the place of the older "from Dan to Beersheba" (<a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). Of that "fire" of judgment, it is said, as in our Lord's use of a like imagery, that it shall not be quenched (<a href="../../par/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>).

It was to him a proof, as a like question was to the Christ (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-16.htm">Matthew 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-21.htm">Mark 8:21</a>) proof that those hearers were yet without understanding. The question was, for those who asked it, an excuse for hardening their hearts against remonstrances which needed no explanation. The indignation was followed by another interval of silence, during which he brooded over their stubbornness, and at last, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a>, the word of the Lord comes to him, and he speaks "no more in proverbs," but interprets the latest parable even in its details. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/19.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 19"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 19" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/21.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 21"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 21" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/21.htm"><title>Ezekiel 21 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/21.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/21.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/21-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/20.htm" title="Ezekiel 20">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 21 <a href="../ezekiel/22.htm" title="Ezekiel 22">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-1.htm">Ezekiel 21:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">

Apparently, the exiles and the people of Judah flattered themselves that the former was the object of the expedition. The answer to that false hope is a vivid picture of what was passing in the council of war which Nebuchadnezzar was holding at that parting of the ways. The prophet sees, as it were, the sign post pointing, as with a hand, to each of the two cities The king consults his soothsayers, and uses divinations.

I follow the translation of the Revised Version, and explain it by inserting words which are needed to bring out its meaning: <span class="accented">It</span> (what Nebuchadnezzar has done) <span class="accented">shall be as a vain divination in their sight</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. in that of the men of Jerusalem), <span class="accented">which have sworn unto them</span> (<span class="accented">sc</span>. have taken oaths of fealty to the Chaldeans, and are ready to take them again), <span class="accented">but he</span> (Nebuchadnezzar) <span class="accented">brings iniquity to remembrance</span>. The fact represented is that when the people of Jerusalem heard of the divination at the parting of the ways, they still lulled themselves in a false security. They and Zedekiah had sworn obedience, and that oath would protect them. "Not so," rejoins the prophet; "the Chaldean king knows how those oaths have been kept." The LXX. omits all reference to "oaths." The Vulgate. taking the word for "oath" in its ether sense of "sabbath," gives the curious rendering, <span class="accented">Eritque quasi consulens frustra oraculum in eorum oculis, et sabbatorum otium imitans</span>. In spite of the reports that reached them, the men of Jerusalem thought themselves as safe as if the Chaldean king were keeping a sabbath day. Ewald partly follows the Vulgate, and renders, <span class="accented">They believe they have weeks on weeks</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will not believe that the danger is close at hand. Keil and Havernick: <span class="accented">Oaths of oaths are theirs</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. they count on the oath of Jehovah, on his promises of protection, but he (Jehovah) brings iniquity to remembrance. <span class="cmt_word">That they may be taken</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. be seized by the invader and either slain or made prisoners

The word "deadly wounded," or "sorely smitten," may rightly be applied to one who fell, as Zedekiah did, from his high estate.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a></div><div class="verse">Whiles they see vanity unto thee, whiles they divine a lie unto thee, to bring thee upon the necks of <i>them that are</i> slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity <i>shall have</i> an end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whiles they see,</span> etc. The words may possibly refer to Nebuchadnezzar's diviners in ver. 21, but more probably to those whom the Ammonites themselves consulted. The pronoun "thee" in both clauses refers to Ammon. The result of those who divined falsely was that the sword would be drawn against the necks of the Ammonites and threw them upon the heap of the slaughtered ones. For them, as in the words that end the verse, reproducing those of ver. 25, punishment is decreed, and that punishment will come.

The question of the Authorized Version suggests a negative answer, as though the speaker were Jehovah, and the sheath that of his sword. The Revised Version, which translates it, with Keil, the LXX., and the Vulgate, as an imperative, deals with it as addressed to the Ammonites. They am told to sheath their sword; it would be of no avail against the sharp, glittering weapon of Jehovah. Their judgment would soon come on them in their own land, not, as in the case of Judah, in the form of exile (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1-8</a> as an expansion of the prophet's thought). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-31.htm">Ezekiel 21:31</a></div><div class="verse">And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, <i>and</i> skilful to destroy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will blow against,</span> etc. The imagery of fire takes the place of that of the sword. <span class="cmt_word">The brutish men</span> (same word as in <a href="../../par/psalms/49-10.htm">Psalm 49:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/92-6.htm">Psalm 92:6</a>) are the Chaldean conquerors. The fact that the adjective may also mean "those that burn" may, in part, have determined Ezekiel's choice of it.

That connection is, indeed, sufficiently indicated by the recurrence of the formula, "Wilt thou judge?" (see note on Ezekiel 20:4). In obedience to the commands which that question implied, Ezekiel has once more to go through the catalogue of the sins of Judah and Jerusalem. It is not without significance that he applies the very epithet of <span class="cmt_word">bloody city</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">oily of bloods</span>) which Nahum (<a href="../../par/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>) had applied to Nineveh.

So, though in another sense, the righteous lives of the faithful are said, in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>, to "hasten the coming of the day of God." Exceptional evil and exceptional good alike hasten the approach of the day which is to decide between the two.

The fifth commandment was trampled underfoot as well as the sixth, and the blessing of continued national existence (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) was thereby forfeited. The widow and the orphan and the stranger (we note in that last word the width of Ezekiel's sympathies) were oppressed (compare the same grouping in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16, 19</a>).

The sin of the informers, ever ready to lend themselves to plots against the life or character of the innocent, was then, as at all times, the besetting evil of corrupt government in the East.

(For those in Ver. 12, see notes on Ezekiel 18:12.) It is to be remarked, however, that the prophet does not confine himself to the mere enumeration of specific sins. These are traced to their source in that "forgetting God" which was at once the starting-point and the consummation of all forms of evil (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>).

Their meaning is sufficiently clear. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah</span> (but both names should begin with O rather than A) means "Her tent;" <span class="cmt_word">Aholibah</span>, "My tent is in her." A parallel, which may have suggested the names, is found in the <span class="accented">Aholibamah</span> (equivalent to "My tent is in the high place") of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-2.htm">Genesis 36:2</a>, and another in the use of <span class="accented">Ohel</span> as a proper name in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-20.htm">1 Chronicles 3:20</a>. The common element of the two names is the word that is commonly used for the sacred tent or tabernacle in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. The distinctive element of each points to the fact that the worship in Samaria was unauthorized. Her "tent" was hers, not Jehovah's. Of Jerusalem with its temple Jehovah could say, "My tent is in her," and this, as magnifying her privilege, also aggravated her guilt. Keil and others take the adjective here, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>, as meaning "greater" rather than "older." The former adjective is, of course, applicable to the greater power of the kingdom of the Ten Tribes, and, even if we retain the renderings of the Authorized Version, is probably the explanation of Samaria being named as the <span class="cmt_word">elder</span> of the two. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-5.htm">Ezekiel 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians <i>her</i> neighbours,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The history of both the sisters passes from the time of the Exodus to that of their separate existence, and starts, in fact, from their first intercourse with the great monarchies of Asia. So far it is less a survey of their successive stages of degradation, like that of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, than a retrospect of their political alliances. <span class="cmt_word">Aholah played the harlot</span>. The lovers, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, are the nations with which the kings of Israel were in alliance, and of these the Assyrians are named as pre-eminent. The word <span class="cmt_word">neighbors</span>, which in its literal sense is hardly applicable, is probably to be taken of spiritual affinity, or may be taken as "come near" is in <a href="../../par/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-16.htm">Leviticus 20:16</a>. The Assyrians were those who, in that sense, came near to the harlot city. We have in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-20.htm">2 Kings 15:20</a> the fact that Menahem paid tribute to Pul. <a href="../../par/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a> and Hosea 7:11 speak generally of such alliances. The black obelisk of Shalmaneser records the fact that Jehu paid tribute to him ('Records of the Past,' 5:41). In the last-named case the tribute consisted chiefly of vessels of gold, bowls, goblets, etc.

It was probably some hue of the Tyrian purple kind which marked the official dress of the "captains" of the Assyrian armies. The words, with those that follow, bring before us the magnificent array of the Assyrian cavalry - a force in which Israel, throughout its history, was deficient (<a href="../../par/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>.).

She adopted the religion of Assyria, probably in the form of the worship of Ishtar (Ashtoreth) as the queen of heaven. Having done this, the kings of Israel sought to play off one kingdom against the other (see <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>). It was, in fact, the discovery of Hoshea's treachery in this matter that led Shalmaneser to besiege Samaria. The result of that siege is described in general terms in Ver. 10. She, the city of Samaria, was slain with the sword, tier sons and daughters were taken into exile.

But it did not. They also 'courted the alliance of the kings of Assyria, as in the case of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-10</a>) and Tiglath-Pileser. Hezekiah followed in the same line, though he too trusted in Egypt, and afterwards rebelled. Manasseh too paid tribute, and made Jerusalem the scene of a confluent idolatry, which included that of Assyria. Even Josiah went forth against Pharaoh-Necho as the faithful vassal of either Assyria or Babylon. The splendor which had fascinated Samaria fascinated her also. Here <span class="cmt_word">clothed most gorgeously</span> takes the place of "clothed in blue" in Ver. 6, describing, probably, the same fact.

She courted the alliance of the Chaldeans. Probably the sojourn of Manasseh at Babylon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) led him to see in that city a possible rival to Assyria. The embassy of Merodach-Baladan to Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39.htm">Isaiah 39</a>.) implies, on the other hand, that Babylon was looking to Judah for support against Assyria. The prophet represents this political coquetting, so to speak, as another act of whoredom. Aholibah saw the <span class="cmt_word">images of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion</span> (probably "red ochre:" colors seem to have been used largely both in Assyrian and Babylonian sculpture as in Egyptian, and Judah seems to have copied them, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>) and fell in love with them. As the passions of a Messalina might be roused by sensuous pictures of masculine beauty, so Judah was led on by what her envoys reported of the magnificence of the palaces, the strength of the armies, of the Chaldeans. The journey of Jonah to Nineveh, and those implied in <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>, as well as the prophecy of Nahum, all indicate a more or less intimate knowledge of the Mesopotamian monarchies. The  mission of Merodach-Baladan would be naturally followed by a return embassy from Judah. A later instance under Zedekiah meets us in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>.

As in the history of Amnon (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>), lust, when it had wrought its will, passed into loathing and disgust. Jehoiakim and Zedekiah were examples of what we may well call this distracted policy. But, as it was, this alienation did but increase her guilt. As things were, it would have been better, as Jeremiah all along counseled, to accept the rule of the Chaldeans. The mind of Jehovah was alienated from Jerusalem as hers had been from the Chaldeans. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-18.htm">Ezekiel 23:18</a></div><div class="verse">So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</div><div class="comm">

All that need be said of the comparison that follows is that here also Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-8.htm">Jeremiah 5:8</a>). What is indicated is that Judah threw herself into the idolatrous ritual of Egypt with an almost orgiastic passion. The harlot nation returned, as it were, to her first love, and renewed the whoredoms of her youth.

The Vulgate, followed by Luther, gives <span class="accented">nobiles, tyrannosque, et principes</span>, and Keil and Hengstenberg substantially adopt this rendering, giving "rulers, lords, and nobles." "Pekod" appears as a place in Jeremiah I. 20 (compare Schrader's 'Cuneiform Inscriptions,' 2. pp. 32, 117,120, where Shoa and Koa are identified with Medo-Elamite tribes east of the Tigris), but the ether names are unknown to history.

The Hebrew word for "residue" (not that usually so translated) is the same as that previously translated "remnant." In the first clause it clearly points to the men of Jerusalem who are left after the capture. In the second its meaning is determined by the fact that it follows after the deportation of the sons and daughters. All that was left - in the parable, of the mutilated trunk of the adulteress, in the history, of the devastated city, <span class="accented">sc</span>. the empty houses - should be destroyed by fire.

The nature of the guilt is emphasized (Vers. 38, 39) by the fact that the idolatrous ritual was performed on the very day in which the people sacrificed in the temple; that it found a local habitation even there (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a>).

The imagery of the earlier stage of the harlot's progress is resumed, and we have a picture almost the counterpart of that in <a href="../../par/proverbs/7-10.htm">Proverbs 7:10-21</a>. She takes her bath, paints her eyelashes with <span class="accented">kohol</span>, the black pigment still used in the East, as Jezebel had done (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). She decks herself with jewels, and sits on a divan (a sofa-conch, rather than bed), and prepares a table for a banquet. And on that table are the incense and the oil, symbols alike of wealth and worship, which Jehovah claims as his, and which she offers to her lovers (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-13.htm">Ezekiel 16:13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 8</a>).

"Sabeans" rests on a Jewish rendering of the text, but, as a people, the Sabeans, who dwelt south of Meroe, though named in <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-14.htm">Isaiah 45:14</a>, were too remote to come within the horizon of the parable. What Ezekiel dwells on is the ever-growing degradation of the harlot city. Not only the officers of the Chaldeans, but the mixed multitude, the very drunkards from the wilderness of Babylon, were admitted to her embraces. Possibly the word may point to the false gods to whom libations of wine were offered, but I incline to refer it rather to those who got drunk at their idol-festivals even in Jerusalem. Drunkenness was one of the vices of the Babylonians, and the prophets, who admired the Rechabites and the Nazarites (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35.htm">Jeremiah 35</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>), must have looked on Judah's participation in that sin as a measureless degradation. <span class="cmt_word">The bracelets and crowns</span> symbolize the wealth and prestige which the Chaldean alliance was supposed to bring with it.

To the prophet's vision all that was passing there was as plain as though he saw it with his own eyes. The siege lasted for about two years. The punishments threatened in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>, had at last come near. We may probably infer that a considerable interval of silence had followed on the Aholah and Aholibah discourse. Now the time had come to break that silence, and it was broken, after the prophet's manner, by a parable. In the "rebellious house" we find, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a> and elsewhere, primarily Ezekiel's immediate hearers, secondarily the whole house of Israel as represented by them.

The people had used that imagery either in the spirit of a false security or in the recklessness of despair. It is now the prophet's work to remind them that the interpretation which he gave to their own comparison had proved to be the true one.

As the cauldron was of brass (Ver. 11), this must have been the verdigris which was eating into the metal, and which even the blazing fire could not get rid cf. The pieces that are to be brought out are the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who are to be carried into exile. There was to be "no lot cast," as was often done with prisoners of war, taking every tenth man (decimating) of the captives for death or exile (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>).

The lesson which the history teaches is, in substance, the same as that of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>. The calamity that falls on the nation will swallow up all personal sorrow, but it is brought home to Ezekiel, who may have read those words with wonder, by a new and terrible experience. We are left to conjecture whether anything in the prophet's home life furnished a starting-point for the terrible message that was now borne in upon his soul. Had his wife been ill before? or, as the words, <span class="cmt_word">with a stroke</span>, suggest, did it fall on him, as a thunderbolt "out of the blue"? I mention, only to reject, the view that the wife's death belongs as much to the category of symbolic visions as the boiling cauldron. To me such a view seems to indicate an incapacity for entering into a prophet's life and calling as great as that which sees nothing but an allegory in the history of Gomer in <a href="../../par/hosea/2.htm">Hosea 2, 3</a>. We, who accept the Scripture record as we find it, may believe that Ezekiel was taught, as the earlier prophet, to interpret his work by his own personal experience. To Ezekiel himself the loss of one who is thus described as <span class="cmt_word">the desire</span> (or, <span class="accented">delight</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of his eyes</span> (the word is used of things in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-6.htm">1 Kings 20:6</a>, of young warriors in <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-4.htm">Lamentations 2:4</a>, of sons and daughters in Ver. 25), must have been, at first, as the crowning sorrow of his life; but the feelings of the patriot-prophet were stronger even than those of the husband, and his personal bereavement seemed as a small thing compared with the desolation of his country. He was to refrain from all conventional signs of mourning, from weeping and wailing, from the loud sighing (for <span class="cmt_word">forbear to cry</span>, read, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">sigh, but not aloud</span>), from the head covered or sprinkled with ashes (<a href="../../par/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>), and from the bare feet (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>), from the covered lips (<a href="../../par/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>), which were "the trappings and the garb of woe" in such a case. <span class="cmt_word">Eat not the bread of men</span>. The words point to the custom, more or less common in all nations and at all times, of a funeral feast, like the <span class="accented">parentalia</span> of the Romans. Wine also was commonly part of such a feast (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a>). The primary idea of the custom seems to have been that the mourner's friends sent the materials for the feast as a token of their sympathy. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.</div><div class="comm">

He knew that his wife's hours were numbered, yet the day was spent, not in ministering at her deathbed, but in one last effort to impress the teachings of the time upon the seared consciences and hardened hearts of his countrymen and neighbors. I cannot help referring to the poem 'Ezekiel,' by B.M., published in 1871, as expressing the meaning of the history better than any commentary. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these <i>things are</i> to us, that thou doest <i>so</i>?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - We must read between the lines what had passed in that eventful night of sorrow. The rumor must have spread among the exiles of Tel-Abib that the prophet had lost the wife whom he loved so tenderly. They were ready, we may imagine, to offer their consolations and their sympathy. And, behold, he appears as one on whom no special sorrow had fallen. But that strange outward hardness had the effect which it was meant to have. It roused them to ask questions, and it was one of the cases in which the <span class="accented">prudens interrogatio</span>, which if not in itself the <span class="accented">dimidium seientiae</span>, at least prepared the way for it. The form of their question implies that they had a forecast that the strange conduct was, in some way, connected with the prophet's work. <span class="cmt_word">Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us?</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-20.htm">Ezekiel 24:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">

There is something exquisitely pathetic in the iteration of the phrase of Ver. 17. To the priest Ezekiel himself, to the people whom he <span class="accented">addressed</span>, the temple was as dear as the wife to the husband. It was also "the pride of their power" (Revised Version), the "pity of their soul" (margin). The former phrase comes from <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>.  When that temple should be profaned, when sons and daughters should fall by the sword, then they would do as the prophet had done. They would learn that there is a sorrow which is too deep for tears, something that passeth show. The state which the prophet describes is not one of callousness, or impenitence, or despair. The people shall mourn for their <span class="accented">iniquities</span>;" <span class="accented">this</span> will be the beginning of repentance. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39, 40</a> was obviously in the prophet's thoughts. We note that Ver. 24 is the one solitary passage since <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a> in which Ezekiel names himself. As single acts and gestures had before (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-12</a>) been a sign of what was coming, so now the man himself was to be in that hour of bereavement.

Then there should come a messenger from Jerusalem, reporting its capture and destruction, and then his mouth should be opened. The messenger does not come till nearly three years afterwards (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>); and we must infer that there was no spoken message during the interval, but that from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-1.htm">Ezekiel 25:1</a> onward we have the written words of the Lord that came to him from time to time, not as messages to Israel, but as bearing on the fate of the surrounding nations.

In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28-32</a>, written not long before, Ezekiel had uttered his prediction of the coming judgment.

Rabbah was left undefended, and became <span class="cmt_word">a stable for the camels</span> of the Midianites and other tribes (<a href="../../par/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>). The prediction has been slowly fulfilled. Under the Greece-Egyptian rule the city revived, was named after Ptolemy Philadel-phus, and was flourishing under the Roman Empire. Remains of temples, theatres, houses, are still found on its site, but its present desolate condition agrees with the picture drawn here by Ezekiel and in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-2.htm">Jeremiah 49:2</a>.

Ezekiel, it will be noticed, says nothing about the return of the Ammonites, but contemplates, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>, entire destruction. The moaning of <span class="accented">Rabbah</span> ("great" or "populous"), the mother-city of Ammon, gives greater force to the prophecy of desolation.

The Moabites may have retained possession of it, and so Ezekiel may have coupled the two names together. Their sin also, like that of Ammon, is that they exulted in the fall of Jerusalem. It was come down to the level of other cities, no longer exalted above them by the blessing of Jehovah. The Moabite Stone, found in the ruins of Dibon ('Records of the Past,' 9:165), on which Mesha, King of Moab, narrates his conquests over neighboring nations, including Israel, testifies to the strength of the kingdom, and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>. and 16. it is represented as conspicuous for its pride.

Havernick quotes a Bedouin proverb, "There is no land like Belka" (see Tristram's 'Land of Moab,' pp. 275, 303-305, 350). Kirjath and Baal-meon appear in Mesha's inscription on the Moabite Stone.

The Authorized Version is obscure. What is meant is that the Moabites as well as the Ammonites were to be given to the nomadic tribes, the "children of the east," for a possession. The doom that Ammon was to be no more remembered (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-32.htm">Ezekiel 21:32</a>) was to be carried out to the uttermost, and the children of the east were to complete what Nebuchadnezzar had begun. The utter destruction of Ammon was, as it were, uppermost in the prophet's thoughts, and that of Moab was but secondary. Historically, the words received a partial fulfillment in Nebuchadnezzar's conquests five years after the destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus,' Ant.,' 10:9.7, and M. yon Niebuhr's 'Geseh. Assurs,' p. 215), but the Ammonites were still an important people in the time of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 5:6, 30-45) and Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Trypho, p. 272).

The moment of Judah's weakness was seized on as an opportunity for gratifying what Ezekiel elsewhere (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>) calls the "perpetual hatred" of the people against Israel, for taking vengeance for the primal wrong which Esau had suffered at the hand of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>).

In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20, 21</a> the cry of the inhabitants of Teman is said to have been "heard in the Red Sea," and this determines its geographical position, as being, in accordance with its name, the southern region of Edom.

In Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit</span>.) Teman is named as famous for its wisdom.

The travelers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries report that "its inhabitants are only a few poor wretches that harbor in vaults and subsist upon fishing" (Mandrell, in 1697); that the number of those inhabitants was "only ten, Turks and Christians" (Hasselquist, in 1751); that there were, a little later on, "fifty or sixty poor faro nee (Volney, in 1766).

So it is used of Philistia (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-6.htm">Isaiah 20:6</a>), and of the maritime states of Asia Minor (<a href="../../par/daniel/11-18.htm">Daniel 11:18</a>), of the east and south coasts of Arabia (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>). Looking to the extent of commerce described in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, it probably includes all the Mediterranean settlements of the Tyrians, possibly also those in the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The report of the fall of Tyre was to spread far and wide. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-16.htm">Ezekiel 26:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at <i>every</i> moment, and be astonished at thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The princes of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">sea</span> are not the kings of the isles, but the merchant-princes of the city (<a href="../../par/isaiah/23-8.htm">Isaiah 23:8</a>). They shall lay aside their robes of state - Tyrian purple embroidered with gold and silver - and shall put on the garments of mourners. <a href="../../par/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6</a> presents an interesting parallel. The word <span class="cmt_word">thrones</span> is used, as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-13.htm">1 Samuel 4:13</a>, for any chair of state, as that of priest or judge (<a href="../../par/proverbs/9-14.htm">Proverbs 9:14</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>), as well as for the specifically kingly throne. For the, most part, however, the later meaning is dominant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-17.htm">Ezekiel 26:17</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and say to thee, How art thou destroyed, <i>that wast</i> inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror <i>to be</i> on all that haunt it!</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Inhabited of seafaring</span>, etc.; Hebrew, from <span class="accented">the seas</span>. The sense is the same, but we lose the poetry of the original in the paraphrase. Possibly, however, the phrase may represent the position of Tyro as rising out of the sea or as deriving its wealth from it. Ewald adopts a conjectural reading, which gives "destroyed from the seas;" or, with another conjecture, "She that was settled from the days of the remote past." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-18.htm">Ezekiel 26:18</a></div><div class="verse">Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that <i>are</i> in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - It is noticeable that the commercial policy of Tyre is not represented as having been oppressive. The <span class="cmt_word">isles</span> do not exult in their deliverance, but mourn over the captured city whose commerce had contributed to their prosperity. The "terror" of Ver. 17 is rather the impression of awe and wonder made on all who came to it.

The image may have been suggested by <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>, where it is used of Babylon. It was obviously one on which the mind of Ezekiel dwelt, and is reproduced in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>. Here, apparently, the sinking in the depth of the waters (Ver. 19) is thought of as leading to that world of the dead that lay beneath them. <span class="cmt_word">The people of old</span> <span class="cmt_word">time</span> may possibly include the races of the old world that were submerged in the waters of the Flood. The imagery of <a href="../../par/psalms/88-3.htm">Psalm 88:3-7</a> seems to have been floating before the prophet's mind. <span class="cmt_word">I shall set glory</span>; better, <span class="accented">will set</span>. The contrast drawn is that between the shadow-world of the dead, and the earth with its living inhabitants. There Jehovah would establish his glory, would, sooner or later, manifest his kingdom, while Tyre and its pomp should be no more, belonging only to the past. Conjectural readings and renderings have been suggested as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Hitzig, "And thou no longer shinest with glory in the <span class="accented">land of the living</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Havernick and Kliefoth, "That I no longer produce anything glorious from thee in the land of the living." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Ewald," That thou mayest not remain (or stand) in the laud of the living."

The dirge over the merchant-city that follows, the doom <span class="accented">sic transit gloria mundi</span>, worked out with a fullness of detail which reminds us of the Homeric catalogue of ships ('Iliad,' 2:484-770), is almost, if not altogether, without a parallel in the history of literature. It can scarcely have rested on anything but personal knowledge. Ezekiel, we must believe, had, at some time or other in his life, trod the sinful streets of the great city, and noted the mingled crowd of many nations and in many costumes that he met there, just as we infer from  Dante's vivid description of the dockyards of Venice ('Inf.,' 21:7-15) that he had visited that city. Apart from its poetic or prophetic interest, it is for us almost the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> as to the geography and commerce of that old world of which Tyre was in some sense the center. We may compare it, from that point of view, with the ethnological statements in <a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>; just as, from the standpoint of prophecy, it has to be compared with Isaiah's "burden" against Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13, 14</a>.), and with St. John's representation of Rome as the spiritual Babylon of the Apocalypse (<a href="../../par/revelation/18.htm">Revelation 18</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say unto Tyrus, O thou that art situate at the entry of the sea, <i>which art</i> a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O Tyrus, thou hast said, I <i>am</i> of perfect beauty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - We begin with the picture of the city, <span class="cmt_word">situate at the entry</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">entries</span>), or harbors of the sea. Of these Tyro had two - the northern, known as the Sidonian; the southern, as the Egyptian. There she dwelt, <span class="cmt_word">a merchant of the peoples</span>, that came, in the wider sense of the word (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-15.htm">Ezekiel 26:15</a>), from the <span class="cmt_word">isles</span> of the Mediterranean. <span class="cmt_word">I am perfect in beauty.</span> The boast here put into the mouth of the city appears afterwards as the utterance of its ruler, or as applied to him (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2, 15-17</a>). We are reminded of Genoa, <span class="accented">la superba</span>.

The words were true of the island-city, but Ezekiel has already present to his thoughts the idealized picture of the city under the figure of its stateliest ship. The builders are ship-builders, and in the verses that follow we have a picture of the Bucentaur of the Venice of the ancient world. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a></div><div class="verse">They have made all thy <i>ship</i> boards of fir trees of Senir: they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fir trees of Senti</span>. The name appears in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> and <a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a> as <span class="accented">Shenir</span>; in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a> it is spelt as here. From <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> we learn that it was the Amorite name for Hermon, as Sirion was the Sidonian name. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-10.htm">1 Kings 5:10</a> Hiram King of Tyro appears as supplying Solomon with the fir and cedar timber mentioned here for the erection of his palace, the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2</a>). The fir tree was more commonly used for ships, the cedar for houses (Virgil, 'Georg.,' 2:444). The Hebrew for "boards" is unique in its form as a plural with a dual form superadded to indicate that each plank had its counterpart on the other side of the ship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Of</i> the oaks of Bashan have they made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches <i>of</i> ivory, <i>brought</i> out of the isles of Chittim.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The high plateau of Bashan, the region east of the sea of Galilee and the Jordan, now known as the Hauran, was famous then, as it is now, for its oak forests and its wild cattle (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The company of the Ashurites</span>, etc.; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">they have made thy benches of ivory inlaid in boxwood</span>. The Authorized Version follows the present Hebrew text, but the name of the nation there is not the same as that of the Assyrians, and corresponds with the Ashurites of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9</a> - an obscure tribe of Canaanites, possibly identical with the Geshurites. A difference of punctuation or spelling (<span class="accented">Bithasshurim</span> for <span class="accented">Bath-asshu-rim</span>) gives the meaning which the Revised Version follows; <span class="accented">thasshur</span> being used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/41-19.htm">Isaiah 41:19</a> and Isaiah 60:13 for the box tree, or perhaps cypress, or larch, as forming part of the glory of Lebanon. The use of ivory in ship or house building seems to have been one of the arts for which Tyre was famous. So we have the ivory palace of Ahab, after he had married his Sidonian queen (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>) and those of the monarch who had married a Tyrian princess in <a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a> (see also <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>). For the use of such inlaid wood in later times, see Virgil, 'AEneid,' 10:137. Either the ivory or the wood is said to come from <span class="cmt_word">the isles of Chittim</span>. The word was about as wide in its use as the "Indies" in the time of Elizabeth. Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) identifies it with Cyprus, which perhaps retains a memorial of it in Citium. The Vulgate, as in <a href="../../par/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>, identifies it here with Italy, and in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a> translates the "ships of Chittim" as <span class="accented">trieres et Romani</span>, while in 1 Macc. 1:1, it is used of Greece as including Macedonia. In <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> the Kittim appear as descended from Javan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are classed as Greeks or Ionians. The ivory which the Tyrians used probably came from Northern Africa, and may have been supplied through Carthage or other Phoenician colonies. A supply may have come also from Ethiopia through Egypt, or from the Red Sea ports, with which the Phoenicians carried on a trade with Arabia. Inlaid ivory-work, sometimes in wood, sometimes with enamel, is found both in  Egyptian and Assyrian remains ('Dict. Bible,' <span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">v</span>. "Ivory").

This, which took the place of the coarse canvas of the common <span class="accented">ships</span>, was made more magnificent by being embroidered with purple or crimson, with gold borders. The ship of Antony and Cleopatra had purple sails, which, as they swelled out with the wind, served as a banner. The ancient ships had no flags or pennons. So the Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">of fine linen, was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign</span>. The word for "sail" in the Authorized Version is rendered" banner" in <a href="../../par/psalms/60-4.htm">Psalm 60:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-2.htm">Isaiah 13:2</a>, and "ensign" in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The isles of Elishah.</span> The name appears in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> as one of the sons of Javan. It has been identified, on the ground chiefly of similarity of sound, with Ells, Hellas, or AEolia. Laconia has been suggested as being famous for the murex which supplied the purple dye. The Targum gives Italy. Sicily also has been conjectured. The murex is common all over the Mediterranean, but Cythera and Abydos are named as having been specially famous for it. Probably, as in the case of "Chittim," the word was used with considerable latitude. The latter clause of the verse describes the awning over the deck of the queenly ship. Was Ezekiel describing what he had actually seen in the state-ship of Tyro?

It is scarcely a mile in circumference, but was prominent enough to be named here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-16.htm">1 Chronicles 1:16</a>.

The word is used in the sense of "elders" or "senators," the governing body. Gebal, for which the LXX. gives <span class="accented">Biblii</span>, is identified with the Greek Byblus.

Byblus was situated on an eminence overlooking the river Adonis between Beirut and Tripoli.

The work of the <span class="cmt_word">caulkers</span> was to stop the chinks of the ship, and the men of Gebal appear to have been especially skilful in this.

The Targum gives "watchmen;" Gesenius, "warriors:" Hitzig, "deserters." The name probably indicates that they were the flower of the Tyrian army - the life-guards (like the "Immortals" of the Persians) of the merchant-city. On the whole, we must leave the problem as one that we have no data for solving. The grouping with Arvad, however, suggests a Syrian or Phoenician tribe. <span class="cmt_word">They hanged their shields</span>. The custom seems to have been specially Phoenician. Solomon introduced it at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>). The sight of the walls thus decorated, the shields being sometimes gilt or painted, must have been sufficiently striking to warrant Ezekiel's phrase that thus the beauty of the city was "made  perfect" by it.

The description in detail that follows is so vivid as to give the impression that Ezekiel had seen the merchants of Sheba unloading their camels and bringing out their treasures as they arrived at Tyro. The blue clothes (<span class="accented">wrappings of blue, as</span> in the Revised Version) were the purple robes of Babylon, which were famous all over the world. The words that follow are somewhat obscure, but are probably rightly translated by Keil, "embroidered of twisted yarn, in-wound, and strong cords for thy wares." The yarn may have been used for the cordage of the Tyrian ships. The words, <span class="cmt_word">made of cedar</span>, are in this rendering taken as an adjective, equivalent to "firm" or "strong" (so Furst).

The ships of Tarshish are used generically for merchant-ships. The catalogue of the commerce ends with Ver. 24, and the more poetic imagery reappears. It was, as centering in herself all that they brought to her that the merchant-city was <span class="cmt_word">very glorious in the midst of the waters.</span> For <span class="cmt_word">sing of thee</span>, read, <span class="accented">the ships of Tarshish were thy caravans</span> (Revised Version). The word has also the sense of "wall," as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-10.htm">Jeremiah 5:10</a> and <a href="../../par/job/24-11.htm">Job 24:11</a>; and this, describing the ships as the "wooden wails" of Tyre, gives a tenable sense here.

The metaphor goes on its course. The state-ship is in the open sea, and the east wind, the Euroclydon of the Mediterranean (<a href="../../par/acts/27-14.htm">Acts 27:14</a>), blows and threatens it with destruction (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>). In that destruction all who contributed to her prosperity were involved. The picture reminds us of the description of the ship of Tarshish in <a href="../../par/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4, 5</a>.

As Tyre itself was the great state-ship, so the other ships may stand for the other Phoenician cities that beheld her downfall. Looking to the picture itself, it presents the rowers and others as feeling that, if the great ship had been wrecked, there was little hope of safety for them, and so they leave their ships and stand on the coast wailing.

He is described here as a" prince," in Ver. 12 as "king," and the combination of the two words points probably to some peculiarity of the Tyrian constitution. "Prince" it will be remembered, is constantly used by Ezekiel of Zedekiah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a>, <span class="accented">el al</span>.). The King of Tyro at the time was Ithobal or Ethbaal III. (Josephus, 'Contra Apion,' 1:21), who had taken part with Pharaoh-Hophra and Zedekiah in the league against Nebuchadnezzar, Ezekiel's description of what one may call his self-apotheosis may probably have rested on a personal knowledge of the man or of official documents. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thine heart <i>is</i> lifted up, and thou hast said, I <i>am</i> a God, I sit <i>in</i> the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou <i>art</i> a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am a God</span>. We are reminded of Isaiah's words (Isaiah 14:13, 14) as to the King of Babylon. Did Ezekiel emphasize and amplify the boasts of Ethbaal, with a side-glance at the Chaldean king, who also was lifted up in the pride of his heart (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>)? For like examples, see the boast of Hophra, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; and the praise given to Herod Agrippa by the Tyrians (<a href="../../par/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21</a>). It is noticeable that St. Paul's description of the man of sin (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a>) presents the same picture in nearly the same words. <span class="cmt_word">I sit in the seat of God</span>, etc. Tyro was known as the Holy Island (Sanchon., edit. Orelli, p. 36). The city was thought of as rising from its waters like the rock-throne of God. <span class="cmt_word">Though thou set thy heart</span>. The words remind us of the temptation in <a href="../../par/genesis/3-5.htm">Genesis 3:5</a>. To forget the limitations of human ignorance and weakness, to claim an authority and demand a homage which belong to God, was the sin of the Prince of Tyre, as it had been that of Sennacherib, as it was of Nebuchadnezzar, as it has been since of the emperors of Rome, and of other rulers.

Daniel was for Ezekiel - and there seems something singularly humble and pathetic in the prophet's reverence for his contemporary - the ideal at once of righteousness (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>) and of wisdom. He was a revealer of the secrets of the future, and read the hearts of men. His fame was spread far and wide through the Chaldean empire. And this was the man with whom the King of Tyro compared himself with a self-satisfied sense of superiority, and he found the proof of his higher wisdom in his wealth. Here, again, I venture to trace a side-thrust at Nebuchadnezzar and his tendencies in the same direction," Is not this great Babylon, which I have builded?"

In the use of the plural "deaths" we have a parallel to the "plurima morris imago" of Virgil ('AEneid,' 2:369).

Ezekiel returns to the phrase in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>.

The probable meaning is, <span class="accented">Thou settest the seal to thy completeness</span> (<span class="accented">perfection</span>). Thou deemest that thou hast attained the consummation of all beauty and wisdom. The LXX. and the Vulgate give, "Thou art a seal;" and this suggests a parallelism with Jeremiah's works to Coniah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>). The words were, of course, written with a keen irony. This was what the King of Tyro thought of himself.

(compare the mention of Noah, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>:14, 20). To him the King of Tyre seemed to claim a position like that of Adam before his fall, perfect in beauty and in wisdom, the lord of the creation. And in that fancied Eden he stood, so he thought, not like Adam, "naked and ashamed," but like one of the cherubim that guarded the gates of the primeval Paradise  (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>), covered with all imaginable splendor. Ezekiel returns to the phrase in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8, 16, 18</a> and Ezekiel 36:35. Other instances meet us in <a href="../../par/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Every precious stone.</span> All the stones named are found in the list of the gems on the high priest's breastplate (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-8.htm">Exodus 39:8-14</a>). Three, however, of those gems are wanting - those in the third row of the breastplate - which are not named elsewhere; and the order is not the same. The LXX. makes the two lists identical, apparently correcting Ezekiel by Exodus. St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-19.htm">Revelation 21:19</a>) reproduces his imagery in his vision of the foundation stones of the New Jerusalem, but naturally returns to the fullness of the symbolic number - twelve. Possibly the description of gold and bdellium and onyx (or beryl), as in <a href="../../par/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11, 12</a>, may have suggested the thought that Eden was a land of jewels. <span class="cmt_word">The workmanship of thy tabret and pipes</span>; better, <span class="accented">the service</span>. The Authorized Version and Revised Version follow Luther. Keil agrees as to "tabret" (so <a href="../../par/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; elsewhere, as in <a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a> and <a href="../../par/job/21-12.htm">Job 21:12</a>, the Authorized Version gives "timbrels"), but takes the latter word (not found elsewhere) as identical with its feminine form, and meaning "female." He sees in the clause, accordingly, a picture of the pomp of the Tyrian king, surrounded by the odalisques of the harem, who, with their timbrels, danced to his honor as their lord and king (camp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-16.htm">Isaiah 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). Havernick, who agrees with Keil, calls attention to a passage in Athenaeus (12:8. p. 531), in which Strafe, a Sidonian king, is said to have prepared for a great festival by bringing girls who played on the flute and harp from all parts of Greece. Others, however (Smend), find in both the words articles of jewelry, pearls perforated or set in gold (as in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-20.htm">Exodus 28:20</a>), and so see in them the conclusion of the description of the gorgeous apparel of the king. Furst takes the words as meaning musical instruments that were of gold set with jewels. Ewald, following out the Urim and Thummim idea, takes the gems as the subject of the sentence, and translates, "they were for the work of thine oracles and divining." On the whole, the interpretation given above seems preferable. <span class="cmt_word">In the day that thou wast created</span>. The words point to the time of the king's enthronement or coronation. It was then that he appeared in all his supreme magnificence. Had Ezekiel been a witness of that ceremony? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a></div><div class="verse">Thou <i>art</i> the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee <i>so</i>: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The anointed cherub that covereth</span>. The word for "anointed" is not found elsewhere, but is cognate in form with that which is commonly so rendered. The Vulgate, however, tracing it to another root, gives <span class="accented">extentus et protegens</span>, and is followed by Luther, Gesenius, Ewald, and others. Keil and Hengstenberg accept "anointed." The sequence of thought seems to be as follows: The splendor-of the King of Tyre had suggested the idea of Eden the garden of God. This, in its turn, led on to that of the cherub that was the warder of that garden (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>). The Paradise of God is pictured as still existing, and the cherub - we remember how prominent the word and the thing had been in Ezekiel's thoughts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-10.htm">Ezekiel 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-16</a>) - is there (according as we take the above words) either as its anointed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "consecrated," ruler, or as extending the protection of its overshadowing wings far and wide as the cherubim of the tabernacle extended their wings over the ark (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-7.htm">1 Kings 8:7</a>). Those cherubim, we may remember, were actually anointed (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>). The King of Tyro boasted that he was, like them, consecrated to his office as king "by the grace of God." In that earthly Paradise the prophet saw the "holy mountain of God," the Olympus, so to speak, of the Hebrews, the throne of the Eternal (compare the Meru of India, the Albard of Iran, the Asgard of German poetry). Isaiah's words as to the King of Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>) present a suggestive parallel. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the stones of fire.</span> The words receive their interpretation partly from <a href="../../par/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>; partly from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-9.htm">2 Samuel 22:9, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/120-4.htm">Psalm 120:4</a>. The cherub's sword of fire is identified with the lightning-flash, and that in its turn with the thunderbolts of God. Out of the throne of God went thunders and lightnings (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The "Flammantia maenia mundi" of Lucretius (1. 73) offers a suggestive parallel. The King of Tyre, like the King of Babylon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13, 14</a>), is painted as exulting in that attribute of the Divine glory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thou <i>wast</i> perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou wast perfect in thy ways</span>. The glory of the King of Tyre was, the prophet goes on to say, conditional. He began his reign in righteousness, but afterwards <span class="cmt_word">iniquity was found</span> in him. And the root of that iniquity was the pride of wealth engendered by the greatness of his commerce (Ver. 16). He was no longer like the cherub who guarded the Paradise of God, but like Adam when he was east out from it. Wealth and pride had tempted him to violence and to wrong, and he was no longer an "anointed" or consecrated, but a profaned and desecrated, king. The, "stones of fire," the thunders and lightnings of the Divine Majesty, should no longer protect him.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a></div><div class="verse">By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</div><div class="comm">

He had forfeited his <span class="cmt_word">beauty</span> and his <span class="cmt_word">wisdom</span> through the pride which sought for a yet greater glory by a false and counterfeit wisdom (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will cast thee</span>, etc. The words are better taken, as in the Revised Version, in the past tense, <span class="accented">I have cast thee</span>...  <span class="accented">I have laid thee before kings</span>. Pride was to have its fall, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-9.htm">Isaiah 23:9</a>. The very sanctuaries, the temples which made Tyre the "holy island," were defiled by the iniquities through which the wealth that adorned them had been gained. The "fire," instead of being a rampart of protection, should burst forth as from the center of the sanctuary to destroy him. Is there an implied allusion to the fiery judgment that fell on Nadab and Abihu (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>) and on Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>)? The doom of <span class="accented">Sic transit gloria mundi</span> was already passed on her.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-19.htm">Ezekiel 28:19</a></div><div class="verse">All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> any more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt be a terror</span>, etc. The knell of doom, as heard in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-36.htm">Ezekiel 27:36</a>, rings out again. The same judgment falls alike on the city and on its king. The question when and in what manner the prediction received its fulfillment has been much discussed. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10:11. 1; 'Contra Apion,' 1:19) states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged the island Tyre and Ithobal (Ethbaal III.) for thirteen years; that, on his father's death, leaving his Phoenician and other captives to be brought by slower stages, he himself hastened to Babylon, and that afterwards he conquered the whole of Syria and Phoenicia; but he does not say, with all the Tyrian records before him, that the city was actually captured by him. It has been inferred, indeed, from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a>, that Nebuchadnezzar's siege of Tyre ended in, at least, partial failure, that he and his army had no "wages" for their work, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that the spoil of the city was meager and disappointing. Possibly the merchant-princes of the city had contrived to carry off part of their treasures in their ships. On the other hand, it may be noted <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the national historians of the ancient world (perhaps not of that only) willingly minimized the disasters of their country; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Phoenician fragment quoted by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21) simply for synchronistic purposes, shows a significant change of government following on the siege. Ithobal was "king" during the thirteen years, but afterwards "judges" were appointed, and these ruled for periods of two, or three, or ten months. All this indicates a period of confusion and anarchy, the consequence of some great catastrophe. As a whole, too, we have to remember that it was with Tyre, as with Babylon and with other nations. The prophecies against them had "springing and germinant accomplishments." What the prophet saw in vision, as wrought out in a moment of time, was actually the outcome of the slow decay of centuries, and of catastrophes separated from each other by long intervals of a dwindling history. The main facts of that history may be briefly stated. There was, as implied in <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>, a revival of commerce under the Persian monarchy, and of this we have traces in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-16.htm">Nehemiah 13:16</a>. Two hundred and fifty years after Nebuchadnezzar, Tyre was still so strongly fortified that Alexander the Great did not take it till after a seven years' siege (Died. Sic., 17:20; Arrian., 2:17; Q. Curtius, 4:2-4). It rose again into wealth and power under the Selencidare, and the Romans made it the capital of their province of Phoenicia. It appears as a flourishing town in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-37.htm">Acts 21:37</a>, and is described by Strabo (16:2, 23), as having two harbors and lofty houses. From A.D.  to 1125 it was in the hands of the Saracens. Saladin attacked it without success in A.D. . In A.D. , after Acre had been taken by storm by El-Ashraf, Sultan of Egypt, Tyro passed into his hands without a struggle. When it again passed into the power of the Saracens, its fortifications were demolished, and from that time it sank gradually into its present obscurity. The present <span class="accented">Sur is a</span> small town of narrow, crooked, and dirty streets, and the ruins of the old Phoenician city cover the suburbs to the extent of half a league round. The harbor is choked up with sand, and with remains of the old palaces and walls and temples, and is available for small boats only. The sea has swallowed up its grandeur. The soft on which the traveler stands is a mass of <span class="accented">debris</span>, in which marble, porphyry, and granite mingle with coarser stones. So it has come to pass that it is little more than "a place for the spreading of nets" and  that the sentence, "Thou shalt never be any more," seems to be receiving its fulfillment. There was for it no prospect of an earthly restoration, still less that of a transfigured and glorified existence like that which, in the prophet's visions, was connected with Jerusalem.

The relation of this city to Tyre was one of sufficient independence to justify a separate oracle for the completeness of the prophet's arrangement of his messages (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-22.htm">Jeremiah 25:22</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2</a>). It was sufficiently identified with it not to call for any long description. It is assumed that her sins were of the same kind and required a like punishment. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, when I shall have executed judgments in her, and shall be sanctified in her.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will be glorified in... thee</span>. The thought and the phrase come from <a href="../../par/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>. Ezekiel reproduces it in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-13.htm">Ezekiel 39:13</a>. God is glorified, or, as in the next clause, <span class="cmt_word">sanctified</span>, when his power and holiness are manifested in righteous judgment. (For "sanctified," see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>: <a href="../../par/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a>.)

As in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-19.htm">Ezekiel 14:19</a>, blood probably points to death from this cause, as distinct from the slaughter threatened in the following clause. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a></div><div class="verse">And there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor <i>any</i> grieving thorn of all <i>that are</i> round about them, that despised them; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be no more a pricking brier</span>. There is a special appropriateness in Ezekiel's imagery. The words had been used in <a href="../../par/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a> of the Canaanites at large (comp. <a href="../../par/joshua/22-13.htm">Joshua 22:13</a>). Ezekiel applies them to the cities which were the most conspicuous survivors of the old Canaanite races. Israel, he implies, had been wounded with those thorns and briers, had caught (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the case of Jezebel) the taint of evil life and evil worship from those races; but for her there is, as in Ver. 25, the future of restoration, and when that future comes, the Canaanite cities, with their idolatries and vices, should have passed away forever. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My servant Jacob</span>. The use of "Jacob" for "Israel" is not common in Ezekiel, but <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-25.htm">Ezekiel 34:25</a> may be noted as parallels.

The restoration was to include also the blessing of confidence and hope; no longer a groundless and false confidence, like that of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-37.htm">Jeremiah 2:37</a> and Jeremiah 48:13, but one resting on the fact that God was in very deed the Judge of all the earth. We may note, at the close of the chapter, how its juxtaposition of the two Phoenician cities seems to have been present to the mind of the Christ in his references to the judgment that should come upon both of them (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-13.htm">Luke 10:13</a>). He himself, it will be remembered, passed through the coasts of Tyre and Zidon (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>), and probably, according to the best text of <a href="../../par/mark/7-24.htm">Mark 7:24</a>, actually trod the streets of the latter city.

It will be well, therefore, to begin with a Brief survey of the relations which existed at this period between Judah, Egypt, and Babylon. After the great defeat of Pharaoh-Necho by Nebuchadnezzar at Carchemish ( <span class="date">B.C. 604</span>), on which Jeremiah (46.) dwells fully, he was succeeded in  <span class="date">B.C. 594</span> by his son Psammetik II. the Psammis of Herodotus 2:160, who invaded Ethiopia, and died in  <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, leaving the throne to his son Uah-prahet, the Pharaoh Hophra of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a>, the Apries of Herod., 2:161. The Greek historian tells us that he attacked Tyre and Zidon, failed in an enterprise against Cyrene, and was deposed by Amasis ( <span class="date">B.C. 569</span>). Zedekiah and his counselors, following in the steps of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30</a>.) and Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/46.htm">Jeremiah 46</a>.), had courted his alliance against the Chaldeans. As Ezekiel had prophesied (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-11.htm">Ezekiel 17:11-18</a>), they found that they were once more leaning on a broken reed. We have now come to  <span class="date">B.C. 589</span>, when Jerusalem was actually besieged, but was still dreaming of being relieved by an Egyptian army.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt:</div><div class="comm">

The word is cognate with that used in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a> for the great "whales," monsters of the deep. The "dragon," probably the crocodile of the Nile (compare the description of "leviathan" in <a href="../../par/job/41.htm">Job 41</a>.) had come to be the received prophetic symbol of Egypt (<a href="../../par/psalms/74-13.htm">Psalm 74:13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-1.htm">Isaiah 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">rivers</span> are the Nile-branches of the Delta. <span class="cmt_word">My river is mine own</span>. The words probably imply that Hophra, like his grandfather Necho, in his plan of a canal from the Nile to the Red Sea, had given much time and labor to irrigation works in Lower Egypt. The boast which rose to his lips reminds us of that of Nebuchadnezzar as he looked on Babylon (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>). He, like the kings of Tyre and Babylon, was tempted to a self-apotheosis, and thought of himself as the Creator of his own power. The words of Herodotus (2. 169), in which he says that Apries believed himself so firmly established in his kingdom that there was no god that could cast him out of it, present a suggestive parallel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a></div><div class="verse">But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will put hooks in thy jaws</span>.

Jomard ('Description de <span class="accented">l'Egypt</span>,' 1:27) gives a similar account (comp. also <a href="../../par/job/41-1.htm">Job 41:1, 2</a>, though there the capture seems represented as an almost impossible achievement; probably the process had become more familiar since the date of that book). The fish that stick to the scales of the crocodile are, of course, in the interpretation of the parable, either the Egyptian army itself or the nations that had thrown themselves into alliance with Egypt, and the destruction of the two <span class="cmt_word">together in the wilderness</span> points to some great overthrow of the Egyptian army and its auxiliaries, probably to that of the expedition against Cyrene (Herod., 2:161) which led to the revolt of <span class="accented">Amasis</span>, and which would take the wilderness west of the Nile on its line of march. <span class="cmt_word">The beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven</span> (we note the recurrence of the old Homeric phrase, as in 'Iliad,' 1:4, 5) should devour the carcasses of the slain, the corpses of the fallen and prostrate nation.

Ezekiel reproduces the familiar image of <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-21.htm">2 Kings 18:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>. The proverb had not ceased to be true, though the rulers were different. Here, again, the imagery is strictly local. The reeds were as characteristic of the Nile as the crocodiles (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-3.htm">Exodus 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/40-21.htm">Job 40:21</a>). The image of the reed is continued in Ver. 7, and the effect of trusting to its support is described in detail.

The words are probably addressed to the nation personified rather than to the king. The sentence of doom is now pronounced, no longer figuratively. And the special guilt for which it was inflicted, a guilt which the nation shared with its ruler, is emphatically repeated in Ver. 9. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the land of Egypt shall be desolate and waste; and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD: because he hath said, The river <i>is</i> mine, and I have made <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm">

Better, with the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia</span>. The Migdol (equivalent to "tower") so named is mentioned in the 'Itinerarium' of Antoninus (p. 171, edit. Wafael), and was about twelve miles from Pelusium, and thus represented the northern extremity of Egypt; as Syene, identified with the modern <span class="accented">Assouan</span>, represented the southern, being the last fortified town in Egypt proper. The expedition of Psammis against Ethiopia, as above, had probably given prominence to the latter fortress. So taken, the phrase corresponded to the familiar "from Dan to Beersheba" of <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, etc. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-11.htm">Ezekiel 29:11</a></div><div class="verse">No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall it be inhabited forty years</span>. It need hardly be said that history reveals no such period of devastation. Nor, indeed, would anything but the most prosaic literalism justify us in looking for it. We are dealing with the language of a poet-prophet, which is naturally that of hyperbole, and so the "forty years" stand, as, perhaps, elsewhere (<a href="../../par/judges/3-11.htm">Judges 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-31.htm">Judges 5:31</a>, etc.), for a period of undefined duration, and the picture of a land on which no man or beast sets foot for that of a time of desolation, and consequent cessation of all the customary traffic along the Nile. Such a period, there is reason to believe, did follow on the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar. It is implied in Vers. 17-21, which carry us to a date seventeen years later than that of the verse with which we are now dealing; and also in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-10.htm">Jeremiah 43:10-12</a>. Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:20) speaks of Nebuchadnezzar as having invaded Libya. The reign of Amasis, which followed on the deposition of Hophra, was one of general prosperity as regards commerce and culture, but Egypt ceased to be one of the great world-powers after the time of Nebuchadnezzar and fell easily into the hands of the Persians under Cambyses. It is noticeable that Ezekiel does not, like Isaiah (Isaiah 19:18-25), connect the future of Egypt with any Messianic expectations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Ezekiel 29:12</a></div><div class="verse">And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries <i>that are</i> desolate, and her cities among the cities <i>that are</i> laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations</span>. As before, records are silent as to any such dispersion. All that we can say is that such a deportation was uniformly the sequel of the conquests of  an Oriental king, as in the case of the captivities of Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) and Jerusalem, and of the nations that were settled in Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>), and of the Persians by Darius; that if we find reason to believe that Egypt was invaded by Nebuchadnezzar after the destruction of Jerusalem, we may assume, with little risk of doubt, that it was followed by what Ezekiel describes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13</a></div><div class="verse">Yet thus saith the Lord GOD; At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the people whither they were scattered:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the end of forty years</span>. The restoration described may probably be connected with the policy of the Persian kings. There may have been a parallel, as regards Egypt, to the return of the Jewish exiles under Cyrus and his successors, though it has not left its mark on history. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-14.htm">Ezekiel 29:14</a></div><div class="verse">And I will bring again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return <i>into</i> the land of Pathros, into the land of their habitation; and they shall be there a base kingdom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into the land of Pathros</span>. (For <span class="cmt_word">the land of their habitation</span>, read, with the <span class="accented">Revised Version, the land of their birth</span>.) (For Pathres, see <a href="../../par/genesis/10-13.htm">Genesis 10:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-12.htm">1 Chronicles 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-1.htm">Jeremiah 44:1</a>.) Its position is somewhat doubtful, but the balance of evidence is in favor of placing it in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt, which Herodotus (2. 4, 15) describes as the original seat of the Egyptian monarchy. Its name may be connected with the Pathyrite name in which Thebes was situated (Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 5:9). The LXX. gives the form <span class="accented">Pathures</span>, and is followed by the Vulgate, with a slight change, <span class="accented">Phathures</span>.

The words describe vividly the condition of Egypt under the Persian monarchy, after its conquest by Cambyses. With the Ptolemies it rose again to something like eminence, but that, it must be remembered, was an alien dynasty. The nationality of Egypt was suppressed, and Alexandria, practically a Greek city, took the place of Memphis, Sais, and Thebes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-16.htm">Ezekiel 29:16</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, which bringeth <i>their</i> iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them: but they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel.</span> Throughout the history of the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah, as in the case of Hoshea (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>), Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-4.htm">Isaiah 36:4, 6</a>), and Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>), their temptation had been to place its "confidence" in the "chariots and horses" of Egypt as an ally. That temptation should not recur again. Egypt should not in that way <span class="cmt_word">bring the iniquity of Israel to the remembrance of the Judge</span>, acting, as it were, as a Satan, first tempting and then accusing. There should be no more <span class="cmt_word">looking after</span> Egypt instead of Jehovah, as their succor and defense. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first <i>month</i>, in the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the seven and twentieth</span>, etc. The section that follows has the interest of being, as far as the dates recorded enable us to determine, the latest of Ezekiel's prophecies, and brings us to  <span class="date">B.C. 572</span>. It was manifestly inserted at a later date, seventeen years after those which precede and follow it, either by the prophet, as he collected and revised his writings, or by some later editor, as a proof that his earlier predictions had already received, or were on the point of receiving, their fulfillment. The fact that the special <span class="cmt_word">word of the Lord</span> came on the first day of the year is not without significance. Then, as now, the beginning of a new year was a time for men generally to look before and after, for a prophet to ask himself what new stage in the order of the Divine government the year was likely to produce. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-18.htm">Ezekiel 29:18</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head <i>was</i> made bald, and every shoulder <i>was</i> peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadnezzar</span>, etc. The words carry us to the close of the thirteen years' siege of Tyre referred to in the notes on Ezekiel 28, and enable us to refer the commencement of that siege to the fourteenth year of Jehoiachin's captivity, circ.  <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>, two years after the destruction of Jerusalem. This agrees with the report of the Tyrian Annals given by Josephus ('Contra Apion,' 1:21), who gives the names of the kings of Tyro from Ithobal to Hirom, in the fourteenth year of whose reign Cyrus became King of Persia. Josephus, however, gives the seventh, in. stead of the seventeenth, year of Nebuchadnezzar as the date of the beginning of the siege. Here the point dwelt on is not the success of the siege, but its comparative failure. The labors and sufferings of the besiegers had been immense. Jerome (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) states (not, however, giving his authority) that these labors consisted mainly in the attempt to fill up the strait between the island-city and the mainland with masses of stone and rubbish. These were carried on the heads and shoulders of the troops, and the natural result was that the former lost their hair and the latter their skin, and the whole army was in a miserable plight. And after all, the king had no <span class="cmt_word">wages</span> for his labors. The city indeed, was taken, but the inhabitants made their escape by sea, with their chief possessions, and the hopes of spoil were disappointed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold I give the land of Egypt</span>, etc. For this disappointment, Ezekiel, writing, so to speak, the postscript which he incorporates with his earlier oracles, promises compensation. Egypt, as he had said seventeen years before, should be conquered, and its cities plundered, and so there should be <span class="cmt_word">wages</span> enough for the whole thirteen years of fruitless labor in the siege of Tyre. In that labor, the prophet adds (Ver. 20), they, though they knew it not, had been working out the will of the Supreme. They also had been servants of Jehovah, as Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:9) had described Nebuchadnezzar himself.

Jeremiah's use of it (<a href="../../par/lamentations/2-3.htm">Lamentations 2:3</a>) may well have been present to Ezekiel's thoughts. That horn had been cut off, but it should begin to sprout again, and the prophet himself should resume his work as the teacher of his people, which had apparently been suspended for many years after the closing vision of the restoration of the temple and of Israel. The words justify the conclusion that Ezekiel resumed his labors after  <span class="date">B.C. 572</span>.

There one like unto man in all things is called to share the sovereignty of the "Ancient of Days," the Eternal One. Here the prophet, nothing in himself, is called to be the messenger of God to other sons of men. It is in many ways suggestive that our Lord should have chosen the same formula for constant use when speaking of himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, and <span class="accented">passim</span> in the Gospels). <span class="cmt_word">Stand upon thy feet.</span> The attitude of adoration is changed, by the Divine command, into that of expectant service, that of awe and dread for the courage of a soldier of the Lord of hosts (compare the parallels of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-24.htm">Ezekiel 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>).

The two highest names of the God of Israel were 'used to denote the fulness of the prophet's inspiration. The same formula occurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11, 27</a>: 13:8; 22:28, and <span class="accented">passim</span>.

The same formula meets us in ver. 7; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11, 27</a>. The prophet is warned beforehand of the (at least) probable failure of his mission, wholly or in part. We note the parallelism of thought, though not language, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>. Such, at all times, has been the condition of the prophet's work. The expectation is grounded upon the antecedent fact of their being a "rebellious people." There is the consolation that in the end, partly through the fulfilment of his words, partly, it may be, through the witness of their own conscience, they shall know that there has been a prophet among them (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>). We note that it is the first time that Ezekiel claims that name for himself.

A cognate form of the first is found in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and there the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;</span>, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">spina.</span> A like figurative use of "scorpions" is found in <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-11.htm">1 Kings 12:11</a> (but here the reference may be to some scorpion like scourge) and Ecclus. 26:7 (compare also our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>). Be not afraid Compare the like command in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17</a>. The words imply, probably, a past as well as a future experience. Ezekiel had already known what it was to dwell among those whose hearts were venomous as scorpions. The comparison was a sufficiently familiar one among both Eastern and Greek writers.

Instinctively he shrank, as Moses had done (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10-13</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>), from his dread vocation of being a "mortal vessel of the Divine Word." In so shrinking he would identify himself with the very "rebellion" which he was sent to reprove, and would incur its punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Eat that I give thee.</span> As in the parallel of <a href="../../par/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>, the words imply that what was to be given him was no message resting, as it were, on the surface of the soul. It was to enter into the prophet's innermost life, to be the food and nourishment of his soul; to be, in our familiar phrase, "inwardly digested" and incorporated with his very flesh and blood. He was to live "not by bread only" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>), but by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of Jehovah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">And when I looked, behold, an hand <i>was</i> sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book <i>was</i> therein;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hand was sent</span> (<span class="accented">put forth</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">unto me,</span> etc. Apparently the hand was not that of the human form seated on the throne (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), nor of one of the four living creatures (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-8.htm">Ezekiel 1:8</a>), but one appearing mysteriously by itself, as in the history of Belshazzar's feast (<a href="../../par/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>). The words connect themselves with the use of the hand stretched out of a cloud as the symbols of the Divine energy both in Jewish and Christian art. The writer has in his possession a Jewish brass tablet, probably of the sixteenth century, commemorating the legend of the miraculous supply of oil at the Feast of the Dedication, in which such a hand appears as pouring oil into the seven-branched candlestick, or lamp, of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, a roll of a book,</span> etc. The words remind us of the volume, or roll, in <a href="../../par/psalms/40-7.htm">Psalm 40:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-2.htm">Jeremiah 36:2</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; like those which are still used in Jewish synagogues.

Jerome, Havernick, Hitzig, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Kliefoth, and others are in favor of the former view, chiefly on the ground that Ver. 3 speaks of the nearness of the coming judgment. That the day of the Lord should be "near" is, however, too vague and relative a term to be decisive. On the whole, the question must be left as one which we have no sufficient data for solving. The close parallelism with <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29.htm">Ezekiel 29</a>. seems to me slightly in favor of the second view.

The word is taken by Keil, Smend, and others of things rather than persons, the multitude of possessions. Hengstenberg renders "tumult" in the sense of the stir of a crowded city.

In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> the two nations are named among the auxiliaries of Egypt.

Now Ezekiel, following in the footsteps of Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46.htm">Ezekiel 46</a>.), specifies the Chaldean king and his people, the terrible of the nations (as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-7.htm">Ezekiel 28:7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.), as those who were to execute the Divine judgments.

The <span class="accented">rivers</span> are the Nile-blanches of the Delta, and their being <span class="accented">dried</span> up points, perhaps, literally to a failure in the inundation of the Nile on which its fertility depended; figuratively to a like failure of all its sources of prosperity.

The remains of an old fortress near the town are still known as <span class="accented">Tineh</span>, the "clay" of <a href="../../par/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41</a>. The fortress stood on the eastern branch of the Nile, surrounded by swamps, and its position made it, in modern phrase, the "key" of Egypt. Suidas and Strabo (<span class="accented">ut supra</span>) describe it as an obstacle to invaders from the East.

Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give "the scepters" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by "supports" or "props," the "red" being used as a "staff" rather than as a "scepter" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of her strength</span>. The phrase meets us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28</a>, and includes what we speak of as the parade of power, here probably with a view to the foreign forces that garrisoned both Daphne and Pelusium.

On the whole, looking to the mention of the "young men" in Ver. 17, the literal meaning seems preferable.

The metaphor was in itself one of the most familiar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>). What is characteristic in Ezekiel is the way in which he follows the figure, so to speak, into its surgical details. A man with a broken arm might be cured and fight again; but it was not to be so with Pharaoh. His arm was not to be bound with a roller (the equivalent of the modern process of putting it in "splints"). The Hebrew word for "roller" is not found elsewhere, and Ezekiel's use of it is one of the instances of his knowledge of surgery. The corresponding verb is used by him of the bandages or swaddling-clothes of infancy (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Ezekiel 16:4</a>).

The image is pressed yet further. A warrior whose sword-arm was broken might go on fighting with his left. Hophra might continue to struggle, though with diminished strength. Ezekiel's words shut out the hope of any such struggle. The left arm also should be broken as the right had been. The Chaldean king should wax stronger and stronger. The sword of Nebuchadnezzar should be as truly "the sword of Jehovah," as that of Gideon had been (<a href="../../par/judges/7-18.htm">Judges 7:18</a>). Figuratively, he should stand before him groaning as a man wounded to the death.

It opens with one of the customary formulae of an Eastern apologue (<a href="../../par/mark/4-30.htm">Mark 4:30</a>), intended to sharpen the curiosity and win the attention of the prophet's hearers or readers. It is significant that the question is repeated at the close of the parable, as if the prophet had left the interpretation to his readers, as our Lord does in saying, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, the Assyrian <i>was</i> a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon</span>. The Hebrew text, as rendered in all versions and interpreted by most commentators, gives us, in the form of the parable of the cedar, the history of the Assyrian empire in its glory and its fall. That had passed away in spite of its greatness, and so should Egypt. The question in Ver. 18 takes the place of "Thou art the man!" in Nathan's interpretation of his parable (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), or the <span class="accented">mutato nominee de te fabula, narratur</span> of the Roman satirist. Some recent commentaters, however, either like Ewald, taking the Hebrew word for, Assyrian" as describing a particular kind of cedar or fir tree, or, like Comill and amend, adopting a conjectural emendation of the text which actually gives that meaning (<span class="accented">Tasshur</span> for <span class="accented">Asshur</span>), refer the whole parable primarily to Egypt, and dwell on the fact that the words of Vers. 10, 18 are addressed to the living representative of a great monarchy, and not to a power that has already passed away into the Hades of departed glory. The former view seems to me the more tenable of the two, and I therefore adopt it throughout the chapter. It may be admitted, however, that the inner meaning of the parable at times breaks through the outward imagery, as was indeed to be expected, the prophet seeking to apply his apologue even before he had completed it. The "cedar in Lebanon" has already met us as the symbol of s kingdom, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The shadowing shroud</span> may be noted as a specially vivid picture of the peculiar foliage of the cedar rendered with singular felicity. <span class="cmt_word">His top was among the thick boughs</span>; better, <span class="accented">clouds, as</span> in the margin of the Revised Version.

The scenery is hardly that of Lebanon, but finds its counterpart in that of the Nile, perhaps also of the Tigris, with the waters of the river diverted into streams and channels by a careful system of irrigation. The cedar grew close to the river itself; the other <span class="cmt_word">trees of the field</span> were watered only by the smaller channels, and so were inferior to it in the fullness of their growth. (For the general imagery, comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-5.htm">Ezekiel 17:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-6.htm">Numbers 24:6</a>.)

Of this we have a special instance in the story of Xerxes, who decorated a plane tree near the Meander with ornaments of gold (Herod., 7:31; 'AElicon,' 5:14; also comp. Ecclus. 24:14; Virg., 'Georg.,' 4:146; Cicero, 'De Ont.,' 1:7, 28).

The second and third persons are curiously mixed; probably the former was in the nature of a warning addressed to the King of Egypt, while the latter continues the parable of the history of Assyria. For <span class="cmt_word">boughs</span> read <span class="accented">clouds</span>, as in Ver. 3. Ezekiel writes as with the feeling which led Solon to note that the loftiest trees are those which are most exposed to the strokes of the thunderbolts of Zeus (Herod., 7:10). The Assyrian's heart was "lifted up with pride" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>), and therefore he was delivered to the <span class="cmt_word">mighty one of the nations</span>; sc. to Nebuchadnezzar.

We note the recurrence of the phrase of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-11.htm">Ezekiel 30:11</a>, as pointing, here as there, to the Chaldean invaders. The branches of the tree were broken, the people of the earth no longer dwelt under its shadow (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a>).

The prophet, as it were, corrects his imagery. The birds and beasts are still there, but instead of dwelling in the boughs, they (vultures and owls, jackals and hyenas) hover and creep as over the carcass of the dead, decaying trunk. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a></div><div class="verse">To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the end that none</span>, etc. With a characteristic amplitude of style, Ezekiel preaches the great lesson of the mutability of earthly greatness. This was the lesson that the history of Assyria ought to have taught the nations of the earth, and it was just that lesson that they refused to learn. <span class="cmt_word">They are all delivered to death</span>. The scenery  of the parable passes from Eden to Sheol, the Hades of the nations, and the prophet gives the first stroke of the imagery afterwards more fully developed in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I covered the deep for him</span>. The face of the whole world of nature is painted by the prophet as sharing in the awe and terror of that tremendous fail Lebanon was made to <span class="cmt_word">mourn</span> (literally, to be <span class="accented">black</span>), the waters failed in their channels, the trees (all that drink water) shuddered. They formed part, as it were, of the pageantry of woe at the funeral of the fallen kingdom. It is as if the prophet felt, in all its intensity, what we have learnt to call the sympathy of nature with the sorrows of humanity. It would, perhaps, be over-literal to press details; but the picture, in one of its features at least, suggests a failure of the inundation of the Nile, like that indicated in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-12.htm">Ezekiel 30:12</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a></div><div class="verse">I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be comforted</span>, etc. The Dante-like imagination of the prophet points the contrasts between the impression made by the fall of Assyria on the nations that yet survived, and on those that had already perished. The former mourn and shako with fear, for it is a warning to them that their turn also may come. On the other hand, <span class="cmt_word">the tress of Eden</span> - the great monarchies that are already in Sheol - shall he "comforted" with the thought that yet another kingdom mightier than they has fallen as they fell (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4-20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17-32</a>, where the thought is elaborately expanded).

The two sections of the chapter, Vers. 1-16 and 17-32, belong to the same year, and probably, though the date of the month is net given for the second, were written within a fortnight of each other. The thoughts of the prophet still dwell upon the downfall of Egypt, and he is stirred, as by a special inspiration, to write an elaborate "lamentation" over its departed greatness. It would seem, from the repetition of the word in Ver. 16, as if the elegy had originally been intended to end there. Possibly it may have occurred to the prophet that what he had written was rather a prediction of coming evil than a lamentation, and therefore needed to be completed by a second, coming more strictly under that title. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-2.htm">Ezekiel 32:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou <i>art</i> as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou art like a young lion</span>; rather, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">thou wast likened unto a young lion</span>. The two clauses of the verse stand in direct contrast to each other. Flatterers, <span class="accented">orators</span>, courtiers, had used the usual symbolism of the animal world. The King of Egypt was as the king of beasts. Ezekiel rejects that comparison, and likens him rather to the <span class="cmt_word">whale</span>, the dragon (Revised Version), in the seas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the crocodile of his own river (compare the use of the "dragon" for the King of Egypt, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). Ewald and Smend, however, translate, "young lion of the nations, thou art brought to naught;" but there is no adequate reason for abandoning the Revised translation. <span class="cmt_word">Troubledst the waters</span>. As in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-18.htm">Ezekiel 34:18</a>, the act is used as the symbol of all selfish and aggressive rule, defiling the streams of righteousness and judgment. <span class="cmt_word">Thou camest forth with thy rivers.</span> Ewald and Smend translate, "Thou didst spurt out the water," as describing the act of the crocodile when it raises its head out of the water as in the "neesings," or "sneezings" of <a href="../../par/job/41-12.htm">Job 41:12</a>, Hebrew [English version, 18]. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will spread out my net.</span> The imagery of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> is repeated, with a variation as to the mode of capture. There is no evidence that the crocodile was ever taken with a net; but Ezekiel may have chosen the comparison for that very reason. What was impossible in the parable, according to its letter, was possible when it received its application. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-4.htm">Ezekiel 32:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The picture is carried out to its completion. The carcass of the crocodile becomes the prey of unclean birds and beasts. The carcass of the Egyptian greatness was to satiate the appetite of the invading hosts. Were the words of <a href="../../par/psalms/74-14.htm">Psalm 74:14</a>, as to leviathan being "given for meat to the people in the wilderness" floating in Ezekiel's mind (compare the strange reference to leviathan in 2 Esdr. 6:49, 52, and in later Jewish traditions)? Greek writers describe the ichthyophagi of Africa as  feeding on the flesh of sea-monsters (Died. Sic, 3:14; Herod., 2:69; Strabo, p. 773), and the word may possibly include the crocodile.

The verb is used of lamps in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-7.htm">2 Chronicles 29:7</a>. The change of metaphor is at first startling, but I follow Ewald, Hitzig, and Smend, in thinking that there is a traceable sequence of ideas. The "dragon of the Egyptian waters" suggested the "dragon" which was conspicuous between Ursa Major and Minor among the constellations of the heavens, and the name of which, probably derived by the Greek astronomers from a remote past, suggested that of an enemy of God (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9</a>). So taken, the new comparison finds a parallel in that of the King of Babylon to Lucifer, the morning star, in <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12</a>. Upon this there follows naturally the imagery of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34-4.htm">Isaiah 34:4</a>. As the other trees of the forest had mourned for the cedar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>), so the other lights of heaven mourn for that particular star which has been quenched for ever (comp. for the general imagery. <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, Hebrew ['English version, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2.htm">Ezekiel 2</a>:31].

The words intensify the bitterness of the downfall. The prophet passes out of the region of metaphors into that of facts. The fall of Egypt will cause pity among the nations. They shall simply be "vexed" in heart, terrified at the thought (Ver. 10) that the sword which had laid her low was "brandished" also against them.

Thus in Ver. 13 we are thrown back upon the thought of the "troubled waters" of Ver. 2. The Nile was no longer to be troubled by the foot of beasts; the streams of justice were no longer to be defiled with a selfish corruption, but were to run smooth and calm, even as the "rivers of oil" which were the symbols of ethical blessedness (<a href="../../par/job/29-6.htm">Job 29:6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>). So Ewald and Keil, for once agreeing. The rule of Nebuchadnezzar was to be a righteous rule, in spite of its severity. I am unable, however, to follow these commentators further in seeing in the words a prediction of the Messianic kingdom. The Egyptians were to "know the Lord," as the other nations addressed by Ezekiel were to know him, as a righteous Judge, not as yet as a Deliverer (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a>).

Taken together, the two passages give a vivid picture of the thoughts of the Hebrews as to the unseen world, and we find in them the germs of the later belief of Judaism in Paradise and Gehenna. What I have called the Dante element in Ezekiel it seen here raised to its highest power. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cast them down</span>, etc. The prophet thinks of himself as not only the predictor, but the minister, of the Divine judgments.

Glorious as Egypt had been, other nations had equaled her. They had passed away, and so should she. <span class="cmt_word">With the uncircumcised</span>. The words, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>, suggest the thought that Israel, so far as it was faithful to its calling, circumcised in heart as well as flesh (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>), had a higher and happier dwelling in Hades than the uncircumcised heathen. As the Egyptians practiced circumcision, the language of the prophet had a special significance. Their place in Hades was among the heathen to whom that hereto was unknown.

Jeremiah (Jeremiah 49:34-39) had uttered a special prophecy against it. From Ezekiel's point of view it might well take its place among the powers that had received their death-blow at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="cmt_word">Yet have they borne their shame</span>; sc. the disgrace of being uncircumcised, and therefore taking their place with the lower circles of the dead.

In the rest of the verse Ezekiel reiterates what had been said in Ver. 24 with an emphatic solemnity. In the Hebrew, as in the English, there is a constant variation in the pronouns used, now masculine, now feminine, now singular. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a></div><div class="verse">There <i>is</i> Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves <i>are</i> round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is Meshech, Tubal</span>. (On the ethnological relations of the two tribes, see note on Ezekiel 27:13, and later on in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, and 39.) Ezekiel obviously speaks of them as one of the powers that bad been conspicuous in his own time, and had been, in part at least, overthrown by the Chaldean monarchy. We may probably connect his words with the great irruption of the Scythians mentioned by Herodotus (1. 103; 4:11) as having swept over Asia even to Palestine and Egypt, in the time of Josiah, and which, after compelling Cyaxares to raise the siege of Nineveh, left traces of itself in the name of the city of Scythe-polls. Many commentators find a reference to that invasion in the "evil from the north" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-6.htm">Jeremiah 4:6</a>; and in <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-13.htm">Zephaniah 1:13-16</a>. They also, once the terror of the nations, are now represented by the prophet as in the shadow-world of Sheol. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Ezekiel 32:27</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall not lie with the mighty <i>that are</i> fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though <i>they were</i> the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they shall not lie with the mighty</span>. The words seem at first to contradict Ver. 26. The LXX. meets the difficulty by omitting the negative; Ewald and Havernick, by taking it as an interrogative, "Shall they not lie," etc.? Probably the explanation is laying stress on the word "mighty." Meshech and Tubal have a lower place in Hades; they are buried without the honors of war. Their swords are not placed beneath their heads (for the practice thus referred to, see Died. Sic., 18:26; Arrian, 1:5; Virg., 'AEn.,' 6:233). For the Scythians, who worshipped the sword (Herod., L 62), this would be the extremest ignominy. In this way their iniquities should be <span class="cmt_word">upon their bones</span> as they lay dishonored. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-28.htm">Ezekiel 32:28</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with <i>them that are</i> slain with the sword.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yea, thou shalt be broken</span>. The words are obviously addressed to Pharaoh. He must prepare himself for a like doom. His place, proud as he was of his magnificence, shall be with the wild nomad hordes of Scythia. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-29.htm">Ezekiel 32:29</a></div><div class="verse">There <i>is</i> Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by <i>them that were</i> slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There is Edom, her kings and her princes</span>. (For the political relations of Edom at this time, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>.) Whatever shadow of power might yet remain to it, Ezekiel, from his standpoint, could yet declare that her greatness had departed. The exultation which the Edomites had shown over the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>) would naturally tend to accentuate the prophet's language. The "princes" of Edom are probably identical with the "dukes" of <a href="../../par/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-43</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-51.htm">1 Chronicles 1:51</a>, where the word means literally the heads or captains of thousands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of tribes, as in <a href="../../par/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5</a>).

The noun for "princes" is different from that of Ver. 29, and has the sense of "vassal rulers," as in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>. So we have the "kings of the north" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>. The fact that they are coupled with the <span class="cmt_word">Zidonians</span> (it is suggestive that Ezekiel names these rather than the Tyrians) points in the direction of Northern Syria, including cities like Damascus, Hamath, Arpad, and others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-31.htm">Ezekiel 32:31</a></div><div class="verse">Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, <i>even</i> Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall be comforted</span>, etc. (comp. for the thought, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>). That shall be all that he will have to console him. As before, other nations were comforted by the downfall of Egypt, so Egypt in her turn finds her comfort in their downfall. All are sharers alike in the fiend-like temper which exults in the miseries of others.  Ewald and Hitzig, here as there, take the word as in the sense of "mourning over." As to the extent and manner in which the predictions of the chapter have been fulfilled, see notes on Ezekiel 29. - 31. Sufficient evidence has been given that Egypt was probably invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. The silence of the Greek historians, and notably of Herodotus, as to any such invasion goes for little or nothing. He could not read the Egyptian records, and derived his knowledge from the priests through an interpreter. They, after their manner, would draw a veil over all disasters, and so, while he records the revolution which placed Amasis upon the throne of Hophra, he is silent as to any invasion, and does not even mention the battle of Carchemish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

For upwards of two years the messages which it had been given him to write (how far they were in any sense published we have no means of knowing) in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25-32</a>, had dealt exclusively with foreign nations. Now his own people are again the object of his care. He resumes his pastoral office at once for warning and consolation. From this point onwards, with the exception of the strange Meshech-Tubal episode in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38, 39</a>, all is leading onwards to the final vision of the rebuilt temple, and the redistributed land of Israel, and through them to the times of the Messianic restoration. No date is given here for <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord</span> which now came to him, but it may, perhaps be inferred, from Vers. 21, 22, that it was immediately before the arrival of the messenger who brought the tidings that Jerusalem was taken. In the ecstatic state indicated by "the hand of the Lord" he knew that some great change was coming, that he had a new message to deliver, a new part to play.

(On the force of the possessive pronoun, see note on Ezekiel 3:1.) The formula is carried on throughout the chapter (Vers. 12, 17, 30). <span class="cmt_word">Set him for their watchman</span>. Ezekiel falls back upon the thought of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, but the image is expanded with characteristic fullness. The function of the watchman, in which he sees a parable of his own office, is to stand upon his tower (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), to keep his eye on the distant horizon, and as soon as the clouds of dust or the gleam of armor gives notice of the approach of the enemy, to sound the trumpet of alarm (<a href="../../par/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>), that men may not be taken unawares.

Has he warned the people of the destruction that is coming on them? The outward imagery vanishes in Ver. 7.

They trusted in the promises of the false prophets (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>). They laid to their soul the flattering unction that they were suffering, not for their own sins, but for the sins of their fathers (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2</a>). Now they stand face to face with the fulfillment of the prophet's words. They cherish no hopes, and they make no excuses. They have fallen into the abyss of despair. Admitting their own sin and the righteousness of their punishment, does not the very admission exclude hope? Who can bring life to those that are thus dead in trespasses and sins? The parallelism with <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39-42</a> is so striking that it can scarcely be accidental 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a></div><div class="verse">Say unto them, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say unto them</span>, etc. To meet that despair the prophet has to fall back on the truth which he had proclaimed once before (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>). He must appear as uttering a message of pardon resting on the unchanging character of the great Absolver. Now, as ever, it is true that he willeth not the death of the wicked, that all punishment (in this world, at least) is meant to lead to repentance, and that for those who repent there is the hope of restoration and of life. No righteousness in the past avails against the transgression of the present (Ver. 12); but then also no wickedness of the past prevails to shut out the penitent's claim to pardon. As a man is at any given moment, when the judgment comes on him, so is he dealt with. In some sense, as in Ver. 13, the righteousness of the post may become a stumbling-block. The man may trust in it, and be off his guard, ceasing to watch and pray, and so the temptation may prevail.

In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7, 12, 16</a>, this and its opposite  had been grouped with other forms of good and evil. Here it stands out in solitary preeminence. The reason may possibly be found in the fact that a time of exile and suffering was likely to make the sin, which the penitent thus showed that he had renounced, a specially common one. The starving man pledged his garment or his tools for the loan of money or of food at a price far below its value. There was a real self-sacrifice, a proof of the power of the faith that worketh by love, when the creditor restored it. The primary duty, when a man turned from evil, was, as far as in him lay, to overcome his besetting sin and make restitution for the past. Compare the words of the Baptist (<a href="../../par/luke/3-12.htm">Luke 3:12-14</a>), and those of Zacchaeus (<a href="../../par/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The statutes of life</span>. The words are used as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>, on the assumption that, if a man kept the statutes, he should (in the highest sense of the word) live in them. It was reserved for the fuller illumination of St. Paul, taught by a representative experience to proclaim the higher truth that the <span class="accented">Law</span>, ordained for life, was yet the minister of condemnation and death unless there was something higher than itself to complete the work which it could only begin (<a href="../../par/romans/7-10.htm">Romans 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>).

The prophet now proclaims what he had been taught, perhaps then, without proclaiming it, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25-30</a>. Men are dealt with by the Divine Judge, not as their fathers have Been before them, not even as they themselves have been in times past, but exactly as they are. Where could there be a more perfect rule of equity? The question how far Ezekiel thinks of the judgment itself as final, whether there is the possibility of repentance and pardon after it has fallen, and during its continuance, is not directly answered. He is speaking, we must remember, of a judgment on this side the grave, and therefore what we call the problems of eschatology were not before him. But the language of the document which lies at the basis of his theology (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>) asserts that if men repented and, "accepted" their earthly punishment, then Jehovah would remember his covenant, and would not destroy them utterly. And his own language as to Sodom and Samaria (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53</a>) indicates a leaning to the wider hope. If the problems of the unseen world had been brought before him, we may believe that he would have dealt with them as with those with which he actually came in contact, and that there also his words would have been, "O house of Israel, O sons of men, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?"

Are we to assume some error of transcription? or is it within the limits of probability that eighteen months would pass without any direct communication from Jerusalem of what had passed there? There is, I conceive, nothing improbable in what is stated. The exiles of Tel-Ahib were not on the high-roads of commerce or of war. All previous communications were cut off by the presence of the Chaldean armies. In the words, <span class="cmt_word">one that had escaped</span>, the prophet clearly referred to the intimation given him at the time of his wife's death (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26</a>). When the fugitive entered he saw that the hour had at last come. One would give much to know who the fugitive was, but we can only conjecture. Had Baruch been sent by Jeremiah to bear the tidings to his brother prophet? Such a mission would have been a fulfillment of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/45-5.htm">Jeremiah 45:5</a>. A later tradition ascribes to Baruch a prominent part as a teacher among the exiles of Babylon (Bar. 1:2) shortly after the destruction of Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a></div><div class="verse">Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the hand of the Lord</span>. When the messenger arrived he found the prophet in a state of ecstasy. This was in the evening. In that prophetic ecstasy his mouth was opened, and the long silence broken, and though he had not heard the message with his outward ears, he had taken, as it were, that message as his text. It was not till his discourse was ended, and the morning came, that he himself heard the terrible tidings from the lips of the messenger. Then a change came over him. He was no more dumb. The long silence was broken. Had the silence lasted, we ask, from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> onward? Had the whole intervening period been one of simply symbolic action, and of written but unspoken prophecies? The words at first suggest that conclusion; but it is traveled by the facts; by the commands of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10, 23</a>; by the order to "prophesy" in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>; by the message to speak unto the elders in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>; by the question, "Doth he not speak parables?" of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>. I infer, therefore, that, though the silence had been dominant, it had not been unbroken. To some, at least, a message had been spoken. Others may have been allowed to read the written prophecies. The death of the prophet's wife tended, probably, to the continuance of the silence, and it seems a legitimate inference from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a> that it had continued from that date onward. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-23.htm">Ezekiel 33:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">

The utterance that follows was probably the direct result of what  Ezekiel heard from the messenger. He it was who reported the boastful claims of those who had been left in the land by the Chaldean armies - the "bad figs" of Jeremiah's parable, the least worthy representatives of the seed of Abraham. the assassins of Gedaliah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</a>), who in these "waste places," the dens and eaves in which they found a refuge (or, it may be, the phrase describes the condition of the whole country), led the lives of outlaws and bandits. The very words of their boast are reproduced: "Abraham, when he was yet but one, received the premise of inheritance. We are comparatively many, and are left as the true seed of Abraham (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-9.htm">Matthew 3:9</a>). The land is ours, and we will take possession of the estates of the exiles." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-25.htm">Ezekiel 33:25</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye eat with the blood</span>. It is characteristic of Ezekiel that the first offence which he names with horror should be a sin against a positive commandment. He felt, as it were, a sense of loathing at what seemed to him a descent into the worst form of pollution, forbidden, not to the Jews only (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>), but to mankind (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>); compare the scene in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>. The same feeling shows itself in <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20, 29</a>. The prohibition of blood took its place, in later Judaism, as among the precepts of Noah, which were binding even on the proselytes of the gate, upon whom, as distinct from the proselytes of righteousness, the rite of circumcision was not enforced; and as such were accepted by the council at Jerusalem, as binding also among Christian converts. Not for such as these was the inheritance of Israel, and the prophet asks indignantly, after naming yet . more hateful offenses, <span class="cmt_word">Shall ye possess the land?</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-26.htm">Ezekiel 33:26</a></div><div class="verse">Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour's wife: and shall ye possess the land?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye stand upon your sword</span>. The words point to the open assertion of the law that might is right. Men relied on the sword, and on that only, for their support. Assassinations, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41.htm">Jeremiah 41</a>, were, so to speak, as the order of the day. <span class="cmt_word">Ye work abomination</span>. The noun, Ezekiel's ever-recurring word, indicates both the act of idolatry and the foul orgiastic rites that accompanied it. The verb, curiously enough, has the feminine suffix. Was it used intentionally, either as pointing to the prominence of women in those rites (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>), or to the degrading vices which involved the loss of true manhood (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>)? So some have thought; but I agree with Keil, Smend, and others, in seeing only an error of transcription. Once more, after heaping up his accusations, Ezekiel asks the question, "Shall ye possess the land?" "Are you the seed of Abraham?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-27.htm">Ezekiel 33:27</a></div><div class="verse">Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; <i>As</i> I live, surely they that <i>are</i> in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that <i>is</i> in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that <i>be</i> in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that are in the wastes</span>. The words paint, with a terrible vividness, what was passing in Ezekiel's fatherland. Did the fugitives of Judah seek the open country? they were exposed to the sword of the Chaldeans or of marauding outlaws. Did they seek safety in fortresses or caves? they were exposed, crowded together as they were under the worst possible conditions, to the ravages of pestilence.

The words, like those of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and Ezekiel 20:1, 49, throw light on the prophet's relations to his people. Now that the long silence was broken, and the prophet spoke with greater freedom than he had ever done before, he acquired a fresh notoriety. The character of his last utterance, vindicating, as it might seem, the claim of the exiles to "possess the land," as against that of the remnant "in the wastes," may even have made him popular. The Authorized Version <span class="cmt_word">against</span> is misleading; read, with the margin and the Revised Version, <span class="accented">about</span>. There was for the time no open hostility. They talked much, in places of private or public resort, of the prophet's new action. Each invited his neighbor to go and hear the prophet as he spake to them his message from Jehovah. And they came <span class="cmt_word">as the people cometh</span>, in crowds, even <span class="cmt_word">as my people</span>, the people of Jehovah, with reverent gestures and listening eagerly. Never before, we may well believe, had the prophet had so large or so promising a congregation. But he was taught to look below the surface and to read their thoughts, and there he read, as preachers of all ages have too often read after him, that they were hearers, and not doers (<a href="../../par/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-23.htm">James 1:23-25</a>). In words they <span class="cmt_word">showed much love</span> (the LXX. gives "falsehood"), spoke pleasant things, but the root-evil, the besetting sin, was still there. Their heart went after their covetousness (camp. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>).

Yet this was the meaning of the large gathering. They came to hear the prophet, as they would to hear a hired singer at a banquet, like those of <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>. The prophet's words passed over them and left no lasting impression. All that they sought was the momentary tickling of the sense. The words receive a special significance from <a href="../../par/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3</a>. The Jewish exiles were famous among their conquerors for the minstrel's art. The nobler singers refused to "sing the songs of Zion in a strange land;" others, it may be, were not so scrupulous. Had the prophet seen his people gather to listen to such a singer? Were they better occupied when they were listening to his message from Jehovah.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-33.htm">Ezekiel 33:33</a></div><div class="verse">And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When this cometh to pass</span>. The words can scarcely refer to the immediately preceding predictions in Vers. 27, 28, which were primarily addressed to "the people in the waste places," the remnant left in Judah, and we have to go back to the wider, more general teaching of Vers. 10-20. That was the prophet's message of judgment, his call to repentance. When the judgment should come, as it surely would, then they would know, in the bitterness of self-condemnation, that they had been listening, not to a hireling singer, but to a prophet of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/32.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 32"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 32" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/34.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 34"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 34" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm"><title>Ezekiel 34 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/34.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/34.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/34-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/33.htm" title="Ezekiel 33">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 34 <a href="../ezekiel/35.htm" title="Ezekiel 35">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-1.htm">Ezekiel 34:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the word of the Lord</span>, etc. As no date is given, we may infer that what follows came as an almost immediate sequel to that which precedes it. The kernel of the chapter is found in the Messianic prophecies of vers. 23, 24, as the first stage in the restoration of Israel which is beginning to open to the prophet's gaze. We can hardly avoid seeing in it the deliberate expression of words that had been spoken by Ezekiel's master (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-4</a>), and which in his case also were followed by a directly Messianic announcement. In <a href="../../par/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>, still more in <a href="../../par/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>, we can scarcely avoid recognizing the distinct appropriation of the words to himself by him of whom they both had spoken. So far as we may venture to speculate on the influence, so to speak, of the words of the prophets of the Old Testament on our Lord's human soul, we may think of these as having marked out for him the work which he was to do, just as we may think of <a href="../../par/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>. and <a href="../../par/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. as having pointed out to him the path of suffering which he was to tread. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe <i>be</i> to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy against the shepherds of Israel</span>, etc. Our modern associations with the words, our use of terms like" the pastoral office," "the pastoral Epistles," lead us to think of the priests and prophets, the spiritual guides of the people, as being those whom the prophet has in view. In the language of the Old Testament, however, as in that of Homer ('Iliad,' 1:1. 263; 2:1. 85, etc.), the shepherds of the people are always its kings and other civil rulers (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/77-20.htm">Psalm 77:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-6</a>), and those whom Ezekiel had in his thoughts were the tyrannous rulers of the house of David, like Jehoiakim and Zedekiah and their satellites. Our Christian thoughts of the word are the outcome of the leading of <a href="../../par/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; but it is probably true that even there the original thought is still dominant. Christ is the "good Shepherd," because he is the true King. His ministers are shepherds as being officers in his kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Should not the shepherds feed the flocks?</span> The question is an appeal to the universal conscience of Israel and of mankind. No shepherd was worthy of his name who did not do that which the very name implied. He that neglects that duty is simply as a hireling or a robber (<a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10, 12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3</a></div><div class="verse">Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: <i>but</i> ye feed not the flock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye eat the fat</span>. The LXX. and the Vulgate, following a different reading, give <span class="accented">milk</span>, and, as "killing" comes in the next clause, this is probably preferable (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-22.htm">Isaiah 7:22</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a></div><div class="verse">The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up <i>that which was</i> broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The diseased have ye not strengthened</span>.

So the broken are the sheep that have fallen from a rock and thus maimed themselves. Each case required its appropriate treatment, and none had met with it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a></div><div class="verse">And they were scattered, because <i>there is</i> no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they were scattered</span>. The words are an echo of <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>, and are, in their turn, echoed by <a href="../../par/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>. The words that follow paint the sufferings of the exiles who left their homes and were scattered among the heathen in the days of Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. Of these the kings took no heed, and shut themselves up in the luxurious seclusion of their palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a></div><div class="verse">My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek <i>after them</i>.</div><div class="comm">

Both chapters should be studied as throwing light on the teaching of the earlier prophet. It may be noted also how the thought enters into Ezekiel's vision of the restored Israel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8-10</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a></div><div class="verse"><i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because <i>there was</i> no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;</div><div class="comm">

Not the sweet psalmist of Israel only, but the lowest outcast, might use the language of <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, and say, "The Lord is my Shepherd." He will gather the sheep that have been scattered in the "cloudy and dark day," the day of the Lord's judgment (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-3.htm">Ezekiel 30:3</a>). For the prophet the words pointed to that vision of a restored Israel, which was dominant in the expectations both of Isaiah (or the Deutero-Isaiah) in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40-48</a>, and in Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-12.htm">Jeremiah 33:12-18</a>), which floated before the minds of the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>), and to which even St. Paul looked forward as the solution of the great problems of the world's history (<a href="../../par/romans/9.htm">Romans 9-11</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-12.htm">Ezekiel 34:12</a></div><div class="verse">As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep <i>that are</i> scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.</div><div class="comm">

The picture of the pleasant pasture-lands of Judah, almost, as it were, an expansion of <a href="../../par/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, of the mountains which are not barren and stony, of the streams that flow calmly in the <span class="cmt_word">inhabited</span> <span class="cmt_word">places of the country</span>, serves as a parable of that which is to follow on the restoration of Israel. The sheep that had been wandering so long in the wilderness should at last lie down in a <span class="cmt_word">fat pasture</span> (ver. 15), and the tender care of the Shepherd should watch with an individualizing pity over each sheep that had been brought back. Every broken limb should be bound up. Every sickness should be treated with its appropriate means of healing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a></div><div class="verse">I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and <i>in</i> a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</div><div class="comm">

What follows introduces another feature into the parable, and is hardly less than an anticipation of the great scene of judgment in <a href="../../par/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>. The "fat and the strong," as contrasted with the "broken" and the "sick," are, when we interpret the Darable, the noble and wealthy who, under the kings of Judah, had been allowed to work their evil will upon the people. Of these he says that <span class="cmt_word">he will feed them with</span> (better, in) <span class="cmt_word">judgment</span>, that for them there must be the discipline of punishment. They too are his sheep, but they require a different treatment from the others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>as for</i> you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle</span>. It may be worth while to note, as modern English usage tends to limit the range of the word, that it is commonly used in the Old Testament of sheep rather than of kine (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-34.htm">Genesis 30:34-42</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-8.htm">Genesis 31:8-12</a>). In <a href="../../par/genesis/30-32.htm">Genesis 30:32</a> we have the same Hebrew word as that which Ezekiel uses. <span class="cmt_word">Between the rams and the he-goats</span>. The words, at first, seem to point to a division like that of <a href="../../par/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>, and may, perhaps, have suggested it. Here, however, the contrast lies, not between the sheep and goats as such, but between the strong and the weak of each class. The "rams" are as much the object of the shepherd's discipline of judgment as the "he-goats." Both stand as the representative of the rapacious self-seeking classes who oppressed the poor and needy, and, not content with being the first to feed on the pastures and to drink of the waters, trampled on the former and defiled the latter. So in the next verse the contrast lies between the "fat cattle," whether sheep or goats, and the "lean."

Here, more than ever, we have an anticipation of our Lord's teaching in <a href="../../par/john/10-1.htm">John 10:1-18</a>. He claims to be the Fulfiller, as of the prediction of <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-3</a>, so also of this. He, the "Son of David," is the David that inherits that among other promises. It has to be noted, however, that Ezekiel's words paint, less distinctly than those of the earlier prophets, the picture of an individual Messianic king, and seem rather to point, as do those of <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> (I do not now discuss the date of that prophecy), to a line of true rulers, each faithfully representing the ideal David as the faithful Ruler, the true Shepherd of his people (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-71.htm">Psalm 78:71</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a></div><div class="verse">And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm">

The whole verse is an echo of <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, in part also of <a href="../../par/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a> [English version, ver. 18]. The words are less definite as to the nature of the covenant than those of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, but probably the same thought underlies both. Sins are pardoned, the capacity for righteousness, righteousness itself, are given. In bright contrast with the picture of a country haunted by the lion, the jackal, and the wolf - the "evil beasts" of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a> - so that no man could pass through without risk, we have that of a land from which such evil boasts have been cleared out, so that men may sleep safely even in the <span class="cmt_word">wilderness and the woods</span>. The language, however, is figurative rather than literal. As the "sheep" are the people of the true Israel, so the evil beasts must, at least, include the enemies, Chaldeans, Edomites, Philistines, and others, that had before made havoc of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-26.htm">Ezekiel 34:26</a></div><div class="verse">And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Round about my hill</span>. Ezekiel's thoughts, like those of <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, cluster round the hill of Zion, the mountain of Jehovah, as the center of the restored Israel. In that land, as the prophet saw it here, and still more in the closing vision of his book (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-12.htm">Ezekiel 47:12</a>), there were, outwardly as well as spiritually, to be <span class="cmt_word">showers of blessing</span> (the phrase is peculiar to Ezekiel), and the land should yield its fruits.

The words at first suggest the thought that Ezekiel was reproducing the ideal picture of the "branch," the "root," the "stem," the "plant." of <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-12.htm">Zechariah 6:12</a>. Here, however, the word is collective, and is translated "plantation" in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-7.htm">Ezekiel 17:7</a>, "planting" in <a href="../../par/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-21.htm">Isaiah 60:21</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>. It can hardly be taken as speaking of more than the general fertility of the land. The rendering of the LXX., "a plant of peace," obviously implies a different reading (<span class="accented">shalom</span> instead of <span class="accented">shem</span>), and this Cornill has adopted in his text. So taken, the words naturally lead on to what follows - the promise that men should <span class="cmt_word">no more be consumed with hunger</span>.

Having announced the future restoration of Israel, as Jehovah's flock, to her own land under the leadership of Jehovah's servant David, who should feed them like a shepherd and rule them like a prince (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13, 23, 24</a>), the prophet proceeds to contemplate the existing hindrance to this return in the occupation of Palestine by the Edomites, who had probably been allowed by the Chaldeans to take possession of it in payment of services rendered by them against Judah in the siege of Jerusalem - to predict the entire removal of this hindrance. (vers. 1-15), and to administer to Israel the comfort which, as a consequence, would ensue (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1-15</a>).

Although already the prophet has pronounced a threatening doom against Edom (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>), he once more directs against, it the judgments of Heaven, on this occasion viewing it as the representative of all those hostile world-powers which from the first had been opposed to Israel as the theocratic nation, and which even then, by their antagonism, hindered her return (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-1.htm">Isaiah 63:1-8</a>).

Against the mountains of Israel had been denounced a similar fate, which the idolatrous remnant that lingered in the laud after the Captivity had commenced began to experience (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-28.htm">Ezekiel 33:28, 29</a>). The doom, however, connected with the day of Israel's return was to fall upon Edom, whose cities should be emptied of their inhabitants and whose fields should be cursed with barrenness (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-13.htm">Ezekiel 25:13</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8, 10</a>).

By this expressive formula Ezekiel intimates the moral effect which should be produced upon the nations of the earth, whether by beholding or by experiencing the Divine judgments (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-10.htm">Ezekiel 11:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-9.htm">Ezekiel 13:9, 14, 21, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a>, <span class="accented">et passim</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7</a>:50 17; 29:46; 31:13; all of which passages belong to Wellhausen's <span class="accented">grundschrift</span>, which it is supposed had no existence in the time of Ezekiel). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a></div><div class="verse">Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed <i>the blood of</i> the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time <i>that their</i> iniquity <i>had</i> an end:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred</span>; literally, <span class="accented">hatred of</span> old, or eternal enmity (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>). This was the first of the two specific grounds upon which Eden should feel the stroke of Divine vengeance. Edom had been Israel's hereditary foe from the days of Esau and Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.; and Genesis 27:37) downwards. Inspired with unappeasable wrath (<a href="../../par/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>), during the period of the wandering he had refused Israel, "his brother," a passage through his territory (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>), and in the days of Jehoshaphat had combined with Ammon and Moab to invade Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-10.htm">2 Chronicles 20:10, 11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/83-1.htm">Psalm 83:1-8</a>). His relentless antipathy to Israel culminated, according to Ezekiel (cf. <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>), in the last days of <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem, in the time of her calamity</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar's armies encompassed her walls, in the time that her <span class="cmt_word">iniquity</span> <span class="cmt_word">had an end</span>; or, in <span class="accented">the time of the iniquity of the end</span> (Revised Version); meaning, according to Keil, "the time of Judah's final transgression;" or, according to Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' the time when the capture of the city put an end to her iniquity; but, with more probability, according to Hengstenberg, Plumptre, and others, the time of that iniquity which brought on her end (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-29.htm">Ezekiel 21:29</a>). Ewald translates, "at the time of her extremest punishment," taking <span class="accented">avon</span> in the sense of punishment - a rendering the Revisers have placed in the margin. Then, according to Obadiah (vers. 11-14), the Edomites had not only stood coolly by, but malevolently exulted when they beheld Jerusalem besieged by the Babylonian warriors; and not only joined with the foreign invaders in the sacking of the city, but occupied its gates and guarded the roads leading into the country, so as to prevent the escape of any of the wretched inhabitants, and even hewed down with the sword such fugitives as they were not able to save alive and deliver up to captivity. To this Ezekiel refers when he accuses Edom of having <span class="cmt_word">shed</span> the <span class="cmt_word">blood of the children of Israel</span> by the fores of the sword; literally, of having <span class="accented">poured the children of Israel upon the hands of the sword; i.e.</span> of having delivered them up to the sword (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will prepare thee unto blood</span>. This peculiar expression was probably selected because of the suggestion of the name <span class="accented">Edom</span> ("red") contained in the term <span class="accented">dam</span> ("blood") - though Smend doubts this - and designed to intimate that Edom's name would eventually be verified in Edom's fate. <span class="cmt_word">And blood shall pursue thee</span>. "As blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and delivers him up to punishment" (Havernick), so should blood follow in the steps of Edom. The translation of Ewald, who reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5da;</span>, "And because thy inclination is after blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee," is hardly an improvement, and is besides unnecessary. <span class="cmt_word">Sith thou hast not hated blood</span>. So render Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Schroder, Plumptre, and the Revised Version, meaning that Edom had loved bloodshed. Kimchi, Hitzig, Hengstenberg, Smend, and Fairbairn regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> as a particle of strong affirmation, equivalent to "forsooth," "verily," and understand the prophet to say that 'Edom <span class="accented">had</span> hated blood. As to the precise import of this rendering, diversity of sentiment prevails. Some, with Theodoret, explain "blood" as an allusion to the blood-relationship of Esau and Jacob, Edom and Israel, and hold the charge to be that Edom had hated his "brother" Israel. Others, with Hengstenberg, take the blood Edom hated to be the blood he had shed. Hitzig and Fairbairn suppose the sense to be that Edom hated the idea of his own blood being shed. <span class="cmt_word">Even</span> - better, <span class="accented">therefore</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">blood shall pursue thee</span>. A parallel to this expression is supplied by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-22.htm">Deuteronomy 28:22, 45</a>. According to the first or commonly accepted exposition of the preceding clause, the sense is that Edom would ultimately fall beneath the great law of retribution, and reap as she had sown - blood for blood; according to the second, the allusion is to the fact that what Edom now most dreaded, the shedding of his own blood, would be that which should ultimately overtake him (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-8.htm">Ezekiel 11:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-25.htm">Job 3:25</a>).

The physical features of Edom here specified by the prophet have often been attested by travelers. "Idumea embraces a section of a broad mountain range, extending in breadth from the valley of the Arabah to the desert plateau of Arabia. The ravines which intersect these sandstone mountains are very remarkable. Take them as a whole, there is nothing like them in the world, especially those near Petra. The deep valleys and the little terraces along the mountain-sides, and the broad downs upon their summits, are covered with rich soil, in which trees, shrubs, and flowers grow luxuriantly" (Porter, in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art. "Idumea").

The second ground of Edom's punishment lay in this, that she had presumptuously as well as confidently exclaimed, not concerning Idumea and Judah, as Jerome conjectured, but concerning Israel and Judah when she saw them stripped of their inhabitants, <span class="cmt_word">These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it</span>; "it" meaning either the region over which the two countries extended, or, as Schroder suggests, Jerusalem their common capital (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/83-4.htm">Psalm 83:4-12</a>). And what constituted the gravamen of Edom's offense was that she had so spoken, <span class="cmt_word">whereas</span> (or, <span class="accented">though</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the Lord was there</span>. It is not necessary, with the LXX. and Kliefoth, to read "is there," to guard against the supposition that Ezekiel designed to suggest that, though Jehovah had formerly been in the land, he was there no longer. But, in point of fact, Jehovah had for a time withdrawn his visible presence from the temple and the city (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22, 23</a>), though he had by no means renounced his right to the land; and Edom's error lay in not regarding this, but in acting as if Jehovah had departed from Israel for ever (Havernick); or (better, "and") in thinking he could appropriate to himself what really belonged to Jehovah, viz. the territory out of which Israel and Judah had been cast (Hengstenberg).

Edom's wickedness should be requited by his being made to suffer the indignities he designed to heap on Israel. In him the <span class="accented">lextalionis</span> should have full sway. Edom's misconception as to Jehovah's relation to the land and people should be corrected when Jehovah should rise up in judgment against him. Those judgments should in the first instance be a revelation to Israel and Judah, who should discern therefrom that they had not been utterly abandoned by Jehovah (ver. 11; cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>); and in the second instance should open Edom's eyes to perceive that Jehovah had been a silent listener to all the blasphemies she had uttered against the mountains of Israel (ver. 12), and had reckoned these as blasphemies uttered against himself (ver. 13).

In this case the sense is that, as the whole land of Edom had previously exulted with joy, so should it in the future be made completely desolate. Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Kliefoth, Smend, and Plumptre, however, more correctly interpret the phrase as signifying the whole human race, with the exception of Edom. Accordingly, the thought seems to be, not that of Ewald and Smend, that Jehovah would make Edom's devastation a sport or comedy (<span class="accented">freudespiel</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> the whole world; or that of Kliefoth and Hitzig, that God would make Edom desolate, whilst all the earth rejoiced over her downfall; but that of Keil, Plumptre, and others, that just as Jehovah was preparing for the whole earth of redeemed humanity a glorious future of joy, so certainly would Edom and all whom Edom represented be excluded from participation in that joy.

Note: That the prediction here uttered concerning Edom received literal fulfillment, the following extract relative to the present state of the country will show: "Idumea, once so rich in flocks, so strong in its fortresses and rock-hewn cities, so extensive in its commercial relations, so renowned for the architectural splendor of its palaces, is now a deserted and desolate wilderness. Its whole population is contained in some three or four miserable villages. No merchant would now dare to enter its borders; its highways are untrodden, its cities are all in ruins" (J.L.

The ground of Jehovah's purposed proceeding against Edom and the surrounding heathen peoples (vers. 3, 5) is expressly declared to be the jubilation over the downfall of Israel, and the eagerness with which they sought to appropriate to themselves her forsaken land. <span class="cmt_word">Aha</span>! Exulting over Israel's misfortune (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-3.htm">Ezekiel 25:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-16.htm">Psalm 40:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ancient high places</span>, which Israel's enemies fancied had become theirs in possession, were probably "the everlasting hills" of <a href="../../par/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>, the principal mountains of Palestine, which, as Havernick finely observes, were "the honorable witnesses and indestructible monuments of that ancient blessing spoken by Israel's ancestor, and still resting on the people;" and to assail which was, in consequence, not only to sin against Jehovah, but to attempt an enterprise foredoomed to failure and shame. At the same time, Plumptre's suggestion ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 8:284; and Unpublished Notes) is not without plausibility, that, considering the special significance of the term bamoth in Ezekiel, the phrase should be held as referring to the sanctuaries which stood upon those heights - including, of course, the chief sanctuary, or temple (Schroder); in support of which the dean cites the frequency with which the enemies of Israel, as, for instance, the Assyrians and the Moabites, in their inscriptions, boasted that they had captured these sanctuaries (see 'Records of the Past,' 2nd series, tel. 1. p. 107; 2:203).

Ewald calls attention to the fivefold repetition of this conjunction, saying, "It repeats itself five times, the reasons [for God's judgments] against these enemies thrusting themselves forward, before the discourse calmly dwells upon the mountains of Israel, of which it is strictly intended to treat." As it were, the prophet's emotion is so strong, and his indignation against Israel's enemies so vehement, that, though he three times in succession begins to prophesy to the mountains of Israel, he on each occasion breaks off before he can get his message told, to expatiate upon the wickedness of Israel's foes. In the prophet's estimation that wickedness was so heinous as to inevitably carry in its bosom appropriate retribution. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span> - literally, <span class="accented">because and because</span>, or <span class="accented">even because</span>, a reduplication for the sake of emphasis, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a> and <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-43.htm">Leviticus 26:43</a> - <span class="cmt_word">they have made you desolate</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and swallowed you up on every side</span>; literally, <span class="accented">wasting of and panting after you</span> (are) <span class="accented">round about</span>.

Keil sees in "the tongue" a personification for the "tongue-man" or talker of <a href="../../par/psalms/140-11.htm">Psalm 140:11</a>; and Gesenius considers the two clauses as tautological.

"The law [of retribution] is demanded by the absolute righteousness of God. The judicial visitations of God cannot possibly be one-sided.

Keil and Plumptre make the subject of the verb the material blessings in which Israel's prosperity is depicted as consisting, viz. the foliage and fruit her mountains were soon to bear for the people of Jehovah. The majority of expositors believe the subject to be the people whose return from exile was in this way declared to be approaching. Nor is there any reason why Ezekiel should not have represented the return from exile as an event soon to take place, since of the seventy years of captivity predicted by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>) at least twenty years had passed, if its commencement be dated from the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>); and the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise was to the prophet so much a matter of certainty (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>) that his fervent imagination conceived it as at hand.

The charge preferred against the country by her enemies was that she had been a land that devoured men and "bereaved its nations" (or, "nation," Revised Version); literally, <span class="accented">an eater-up of men and a bereaver of thy nations; i.e.</span> of Israel and Judah, perhaps also of the Canaanites, their predecessors (Fausset), the image being that of a wild beast which ravages the population and makes them childless, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a> and Ezekiel 14:15 (Smend), rather than that of an unnatural mother, a <span class="accented">Rabenmutter</span>, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-29.htm">2 Kings 6:29</a>, who devours her offspring (Ewald). This charge, in which, perhaps, the prophet detected an allusion to <a href="../../par/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>, had certainly in times past been true; not, however, as Hengstenberg suggests, because the land had been "an apple of discord for the Asiatic and African powers," or, as Ewald explains, because "the tremendous restlessness, the excited push and hurry of such a mentally active city must in any case have used up its inhabitants more rapidly;" but, as Keil, Plumptre, and others interpret, because of the judgments of sword, famine, and pestilence sent upon the land by Jehovah for its sins. These judgments had so destroyed its inhabitants, first the Canaanites, and latterly the two peoples of Israel and Judah, that "those who looked upon it deemed it a fatal land, which brought destruction to all who should occupy it" (Currey). In the golden age to which the prophet looked forward, no such reproach should be possible. Not only should the laud not bereave its nations (according to the Keri, followed by the Authorized and Revised Versions, as well as by Ewald and Smend), but (according to the Chethib, preferred by Keil, Kliefoth, Havernick, Heugstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre) it should not even cause them (or it) to stumble; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should no more cause its inhabitants to lapse into those sins, amongst which idolatry stood prominent, which entailed on them ruin. Hengstenberg's idea, that "moral stumbling is not to be thought of in this connection," is certainly to be rejected.

This prophecy clearly looked beyond the return from exile under Zerubbabel and Joshua, Ezra and Neherajah, since under these leaders only a portion of the whole house of Israel re<span class="accented">established</span> themselves in Canaan, while the land was often afterwards subjected to reproach and oppression under heathen powers.

Their ways and doings, i.e. their violent deeds and idolatrous practices (ver. 18), were as morally loathsome in Jehovah's sight as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation was materially disgusting. The comparison may have been derived from <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, but was as likely to have been original, seeing Ezekiel was a priest-prophet, to whom the details of the Levitical Law must have been familiar (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>).

As a woman in her separation was not only defiled, but separated from the congregation <a href="../../par/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), so Israel, having defiled both herself and her land, required to be removed from it (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a>). And she was. Jehovah scattered her among the heathen and dispersed her through the countries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a></div><div class="verse">And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These <i>are</i> the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They profaned my holy Name</span>; or, <span class="accented">the name of my holiness</span>. According to Kliefoth, the subject of the verb is "the heathen," but expositors generally regard it as "the house of Israel" of ver. 17. Plumptre thinks that "while grammatically the words may refer to either the heathen or the exiles of Israel, possibly the sentence was purposely left vague, so as to describe the fact in which both were sharers," and cites in support of this view similar constructions in <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-5.htm">Isaiah 55:5</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>. What led to the profanation of Jehovah's Name by the heathen was the arrival among them, not of the news of the calamity which had befallen Israel (Kliefoth, Hengstenberg), but of the house of Israel itself; and the actual profanation lay in this, that, having beheld the exiles, they said, <span class="cmt_word">These are the people of the Lord, and they are gone forth out of his land.</span> As the heathen recognized only local divinities, they concluded Jehovah had either behaved capriciously towards his people and east them off (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-40.htm">Jeremiah 23:40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>), or had proved unequal to the task of protecting them so that they had been driven off (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-5.htm">Ezekiel 20:5</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-9.htm">Jeremiah 14:9</a>). In either case, the honor of Jehovah had been lessened in the minds  and tarnished by the words of the heathen, and inasmuch as this result had been brought about by Israel's sin, on Israel properly the blame lay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a></div><div class="verse">But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I had pity for mille holy Name</span>. Havernick, after the LXX., wrongly renders, "I spared (them, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Israel) for my holy Name s sake; but the preposition for or "upon" following the verb usually marks the object upon which the action of the verb terminates (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a>). Gesenius translates, "I will be sparing of my holy Name;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> I will care for its honor.

Thus Jehovah repudiates the claim of merit on Israel's part (comp. ver. 32); and if Israel had no claim on Jehovah for deliverance from the Babylonish exile any more than she had at first to be put in possession of Canaan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>), much less has fallen man a claim on God for salvation from the condemnation and dominion of sin (<a href="../../par/romans/11-6.htm">Romans 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>). As the essential holiness and righteousness of God were the real reason of Israel's exile and dispersion among the nations, so were these qualities in God the ultimate grounds to which Israel's recovery and restoration should be traced. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a></div><div class="verse">And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will sanctify my great Name</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the name of my holiness (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-11.htm">Malachi 1:11</a>). As Israel's dispersion had caused that Name to be profaned, so Israel's restoration would secure that it should be magnified among the heathen (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-23.htm">Ezekiel 38:23</a>), who should learn from this event that their previous ideas of Jehovah, as a feeble and local divinity, had been wrong. The question whether your eyes, as in the Hebrew text, or "their eyes," as in many ancient versions, should be read is debated. The latter reading appears to be demanded by the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of Ezekiel (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-27.htm">Ezekiel 39:27</a>), and is adopted by both English versions as well as by interpreters of eminence; but other expositors of equal name adhere to the former reading on the ground that the sanctifying of Jehovah's Name in the eyes of Israel was an indispensable preliminary to its sanctification in the eyes of the heathen. Havernick regards "their eyes" as "an obvious emendation to relieve a difficulty," to which in no case should criticism accord the preference; while Keil gives it the preference, though admitting that "your eyes" can be justified. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a></div><div class="verse">For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will take you from among the heathen</span>; or, <span class="accented">nations</span>. The first step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name. A promise already given (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-17.htm">Ezekiel 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-41.htm">Ezekiel 20:41, 42</a>), and afterwards repeated (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>). The mention of "all countries" shows the prophet's gaze to have been directed beyond the present or immediate future. The Israel of Ezekiel's time had not been scattered among and could not be gathered from all, countries; yet in the years that have passed since then Ezekiel's language as to Israel's dispersion has been literally fulfilled. Wherefore the inference is reasonable that the reassembling to which Ezekiel refers is an event that has not yet occurred, at least in its fullest measure and degree, but will only then be realized completely and finally when the scattered members of the house of Israel shall have been received into the Christian Church (<a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25, 26</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="cmt_word">I will sprinkle clean water upon you</span>. The second step in the sanctification of Jehovah's Name, and one absolutely necessary to render the preceding either permanent or valuable, was the moral renovation of the people; and in this the first stage was the forgiveness of the people's sins. The image under which this is set forth, "sprinkling with clean water," would naturally present itself to a priest-prophet such as Ezekiel. Jarchi, Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hengstenberg, and others suppose the allusion to be to the water of purification prepared by mixing running water with the ashes of a red heifer (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-17.htm">Numbers 19:17-19</a>), and in the account given of this rite the verb for "sprinkle" is that used by Ezekiel, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>. Havernick prefers the rite performed in the consecration of the Levites (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-7.htm">Numbers 8:7, 21</a>). Smend, who holds the priest-code had no existence in Ezekiel's day, traces the image to <a href="../../par/zechariah/13-1.htm">Zechariah 13:1</a> or <a href="../../par/psalms/51-2.htm">Psalm 51:2</a>, though he also cites <a href="../../par/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>. Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Currey think of the lustrations of the Law in general; and perhaps this best explains the prophet's language, since the element sprinkled is not "blood" or "water mixed with ashes," but "clean water," "the best known means of purification" (Schroder). As to whether legal or moral cleansing were intended by the prophet, possibly Ezekiel drew no sharp distinction between the two, such as the New Testament draws between justification and sanctification; if he did, then the figure in the text must be taken as alluding rather to the former than to the latter - rather to the forgiveness of Israel's sin than to the regeneration of Israel's heart, which is next referred to. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a></div><div class="verse">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you.</span> The third step in the progress of sanctifying Jehovah's Name (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>, where a similar promise is made, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>, where the new heart is represented as a thing Israel must make for herself). This antinomy frequently occurs in Scripture, which never shrinks from holding man responsible for the production of that, as e.g. faith, for which he is incompetent without the help of Divine grace. Besides the cleansing of her guilt and her restitution in consequence to Jehovah's favor, Israel is promised such an inward renovation of her moral and spiritual disposition as to secure that she shall in future adhere to the worship and service of Jehovah. This change is described in a fourfold way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Negatively</span>, as a removal of the old, stony, unsusceptible heart, which had remained impervious to all appeals and insertsible to all higher feelings (<a href="../../par/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Positively</span>, as a new heart and a new spirit, called elsewhere "one heart" and "a heart of flesh" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-39.htm">Jeremiah 32:39</a>), "a heart to know God" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">Causally</span>, its existence being traced to the indwelling of God's Spirit, who writes God's Law upon the new heart, and inclines it to a life of obedience thereto (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Practically</span>, by its manifestation, walking in God's statutes and keeping God s judgments (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-20.htm">Ezekiel 11:20</a>).

The absence of the customary "and" (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14, 22</a>), wanting only once again (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), appears to indicate something extraordinary and unusual in the prophet's experience. In the words of Ewald, such a never-beheld sight one sees freely (by itself) in a moment of higher inspiration or never;" and that in this whole vision the prophet was the subject of a special and intensified inspiration is evident, not alone from the contents of the vision, but also from the language in which it is recorded. <span class="cmt_word">And carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord.</span> So the Vulgate and Hitzig - a translation which Smend thinks might be justified by an appeal to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, in which the similar phrase, "Spirit of God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>)," occurs; though, with Grotius, Havernick, Keil, and others, he prefers the rendering of the LXX., "And Jehovah carried me out in the Spirit." The Revised Version combines the two thus: "And he carried me out in the Spirit of the <span class="accented">Lord</span>." Keil suggests that the words, "of God," in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>, were omitted here because of the word "Jehovah" immediately following. <span class="cmt_word">And set me down in the midst of the valley.</span> As the article indicates, the valley in the neighborhood of Tel-Abib, where the prophet received his first instructions concerning his mission (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>); although Hengstenberg holds, wrongly we think, that "the valley here has nothing to do with the valley in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>." <span class="cmt_word">Which</span> (literally, <span class="accented">and it</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>was full of bones</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of men who had been slaughtered there (ver. 9; comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-11.htm">Ezekiel 39:11</a>), and whose corpses had been left unburied upon the face of the plain (ver. 3), so that they were seen by the prophet. Whether these bones were actually in the valley, or merely formed part of the vision, can only be conjectured, though the latter opinion seems the more probable. At the same time, such a plain as is here depicted may well have been a battle-ground on which Assyrian and Chaldean armies had often met. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-2.htm">Ezekiel 37:2</a></div><div class="verse">And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, <i>there were</i> very many in the open valley; and, lo, <i>they were</i> very dry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he caused me to pass by them round about</span>. Not over, as Keil, Klie-foth, and Plumptre translate, but round about them, so as to view them from every side. The result of the prophet's inspection of the bones was to excite within him a feeling of surprise which expressed itself in a twofold behold; the first occasioned by a contemplation of their number, <span class="cmt_word">very many</span>, and their situation, <span class="cmt_word">in the open valley</span>, literally, <span class="accented">upon the face of the valley; i.e.</span> not underground, where they could not have been seen, but upon the surface of the soil, and not piled up in heaps, but scattered over the ground; and the second by a discernment of their condition as <span class="cmt_word">very dry</span>, so bleached and withered as to foreclose, not the possibility alone, but also the thought of their resuscitation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-3.htm">Ezekiel 37:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Son of man, can these bones live?</span> Whether or not this question was directed, as Plumptre surmises, to meet despairing thoughts which had arisen in the prophet's own mind, it seems reasonable to hold, with Havernick, that the question was addressed to him as representing "ever against God the people, and certainly as to this point the natural and purely human consciousness of the same," to which Israel's restoration appeared as unlikely an occurrence as the reanimation of the withered bones that lay around. The extreme improbability, if not absolute impossibility, of the occurrence, at least to human reason and power, is perhaps pointed at in the designation "Son of man" here given to the prophet. The prophet's answer, <span class="cmt_word">O Lord God, thou knowest</span>, is not to be interpreted as proving that to the prophet hitherto the thought of a resurrection had been unfamiliar, if not completely absent, or as giving a direct reply either affirmative or negative to the question proposed to him, but merely as expressing the prophet's sense of the greatness of the wonder suggested to his mind, with perhaps a latent acknowledgment that God alone had the power by which such a wonder could, and therefore alone also the knowledge whether it would, be accomplished (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-4.htm">Ezekiel 37:4</a></div><div class="verse">Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prophesy upon</span> (or, over) <span class="cmt_word">then bones</span>. This instruction - which shows Jehovah regarded the prophet's answer as equivalent to an admission that the revivification of the bones lay within his (Jehovah's) power - was not a mere command to predict, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2</a> and Ezekiel 11:4, but an injunction to utter the Divine word through which the miracle (of creation, as it really was) should be performed. "The significance of the command lies in the fact that it taught the prophet that he was himself to be instrumental in the great work of resuscitation. He who had been so often troubled with the sense of impotence and failure, who had heard the people say of him, 'Both he not speak parables?' who had been to them as the lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and nothing more than that, was at last to learn that the word of the Lord,' spoken by his lips, was mighty, and would not return to him void" (Plumptre).

The real agent, therefore, in the resuscitation of the bones was to be, not the prophet or the word, but Jehovah himself; and that the end aimed at by the Divine activity was "life" shows the breath spoken of (ruach) was not to be the wind, as in ver. 9, or the Spirit, but the breath of life, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a> and Genesis 7:22 (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>).

The words uttered were without doubt those of vers. 4-6. The effect produced is depicted in its various steps. First, there resulted a noise - literally, a <span class="accented">voice</span> - which the Revisers take to have been "a thundering;" and Havernick, Keil, Smend, and others, "a sound" in general; but which Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, with more propriety, regard as having been an audible voice, if not, as Kliefoth supposes, the trumpet-blast or "voice of God," which, according to certain New Testament passages, shall precede the resurrection and awaken the dead (<a href="../../par/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>); perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, the "counterpart" thereof. <span class="cmt_word">Next, a shaking</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.); which the Revisers, following Klie-foth, understand to have been an earthquake, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), and Ewald explains as "a peal of thunder running through the entire announcement," as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-12.htm">Ezekiel 3:12, 13</a> and Ezekiel 38:19, 20; but which is better interpreted by Keil, Smend, and others as a rustling proceeding from a movement among the bones. Thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the bones came together</span> in the body as a whole, and in particular bone to his bone; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> each <span class="cmt_word">bone to the bone</span> with which it was designed to be united, as e.g. "the upper to the lower part of the arm" (Schroder). <span class="cmt_word">Lastly, the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above</span>; or, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">there were sinews upon them</span>, <span class="accented">and flesh came up and skin covered them above</span>; precisely as Jehovah had announced to the prophet would take place (ver. 6). Yet, though the external framework of the bodies was finished, there was <span class="cmt_word">no breath in them</span> - <span class="accented">ruach</span> having still the same import as in ver. 5. With this the preliminary stage in the reanimating process terminated.

"Four winds" are mentioned, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a>, to indicate the four quarters of heaven (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>), and perhaps also to suggest the immense quantity of vitalizing force demanded by the multitude of the dead (Smend), "the fullness and force of the Spirit's operations" (Hengstenberg), or the notion that the Spirit, in resuscitating Israel, would make use of all the varied forces that were then working in the world (Plumptre). The designation of the dead as slain reveals that the resurrection intended was not that of men in general, but of the nation of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-10.htm">Ezekiel 37:10</a></div><div class="verse">So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An exceeding great army</span>. This harmonizes with the feature in the vision which describes the bones as those of slain men, while also it may be viewed as foreshadowing the future destiny of Israel. "The bones of the slain on the field of battle, having been brought together, clothed with flesh, and a new life breathed into them, now they stand up, not as 'a mixed multitude,' but as 'an exceeding great army' prepared to take their part in the wars of Jehovah under new and happier conditions" (Plumptre). (On the phrase, "to stand upon the feet," comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-1.htm">Ezekiel 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-12.htm">Zechariah 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11</a>.)

On the principle that "God is his own best interpreter," it should not be difficult to see that, whatever foreshadowings of the final resurrection of the just may be contained in the vision, its primary intention was to depict the political and national restoration of Israel (Ephraim and Judah) whose condition at the time the field of withered bones appropriately represented. That Hitzig errs in supposing the "bones" alluded to in this verse symbolized the portions of Ephraim and Judah then dead, instead of the portions still living (in exile), who considered themselves as practically dead, is apparent from the words that follow. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they say</span>. The complaint was manifestly taken from the popular sayings current among the people of the exile. Broken up, dispersed, expatriated, and despairing, the members of what had once been "the whole house of Israel" felt there was no hope more of recovering national life and unity. The cheerless character of the outlook they expressed by saying, Our bones (not the bones of the dead, but of the living) are dried - meaning, "The vital force of our nation is gone" (the bones being regarded in Scripture as the seat of the vital force comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">our hope is lost</span> -  our hope, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of ever again returning to our own land or regaining national existence - and <span class="cmt_word">we are out off for our parts</span>; literally, <span class="accented">we are cut off for ourselves</span>; which Gesenius explains to mean, "We are <span class="accented">lost</span>," taking <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;&#x5e1;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5da;&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>; Hitzig, "We are reduced to ourselves;" Delitzsch and Keil, "We are cut off from the land of the living," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is all over with us; Hengstenberg, "We are cut off - a sad fact for us;" Revised Version, "We are clean cut off;" any one of which renders the force of the words (scrap. <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-54.htm">Lamentations 3:54</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-12.htm">Ezekiel 37:12</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will open your graves</span>. That this is not exact interpretation of the foregoing symbol may be argued from the fact that in the vision no mention is made of graves; yet the discrepancy to which it is supposed to point is more apparent than real. If the prophet was to see the bones, it was requisite that these should be above ground rather than beneath. On the other hand, when one speaks of a grave, it is not needful to always think of an underground tomb. To all intents and purposes a person is in his grave when, life being extinct, his body has returned to the dust. So, the opening of graves promised in Scripture is not so much, or always, the cleaving asunder of material sepulchers, as the bringing back to life of those whose bodies have returned to the dust. Hence the opening of Israel's graves could only signify the reawakening of the politically and religiously dead people to national and spiritual life. This was the first step in the restoration of the future held up before the minds of the despairing people. The second, indicated by the clause, and allah put my Spirit in you, pointed, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26, 27</a>, to their future endowment with higher moral and spiritual life than they had previously possessed, and not merely, as in vers. 5, 6, to their political and national resuscitation (Smend). The last step, the re-establishment of the reconstructed nation in Palestine, was guaranteed by the word, <span class="cmt_word">I will place you in your own land.</span> The circumstance that this is twice repeated (vers. 12, 14) shows that whatever view be entertained of the ultimate occupation of Canaan by Israel, this was the goal towards which the vision looked. That it received partial, limited, and temporary fulfillment of a literal kind in the restoration under Zerubbabel and Ezra, is undeniable; that it will ever obtain historical realization of a permanent sort is doubtful; that it will eventually find its highest significance when God's spiritual Israel, the Church of Christ, takes possession of the heavenly Canaan, is one of the clearest and surest announcements of Scripture. <span class="cmt_word">NOTE</span>. - On the above nine verses (6-14) Plumptre writes, "We can scarcely fail to find, in our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/john/5.htm">John 5</a>, something like an echo of Ezekiel's teaching. There also, though the truth of the general resurrection is declared more clearly, the primary thought is that of a spiritual resurrection. Further, we may note that the complement of Ezekiel's message is found in the language of <a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a>. Taking the two together, we find both reproduced in the teaching of <a href="../../par/john/5.htm">John 5</a>." (manuscript notes).

Its connection with this is apparent, treating as it does of the union of the then severed branches of the house of Israel, and of the subsequent prosperity which should attend united Israel under the rule of the Messianic King of the future. That this oracle, like the former, had only a temporary and partial accomplishment in the return from captivity is so obvious as to stand in no need of demonstration. Its true fulfillment must be sought in the future ingathering of Israel to the Christian Church. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and <i>for</i> all the house of Israel his companions:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee one stick, and write</span>. The symbolic action thus prescribed to the prophet was manifestly based on the well-known historical fact that the tribes of Israel, in Mosaic times, had been represented by a rod, on which was inscribed the name of the tribe (<a href="../../par/numbers/17-2.htm">Numbers 17:2</a>); but whether the stick Ezekiel was instructed to take was a staff, <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX., Hirernick, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend), or a block (Ewald), or simply a piece (Keil, Schroder) of wood on which a few words might be traced, cannot be decided. On the first stick the prophet was directed to write, <span class="cmt_word">For Judah, and the house of his companions</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the southern kingdom and those of the northern tribes who adhered to it, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Benjamin, Levi, and part of Simeon, with those devout Jehovah-worshippers who from time to time emigrated from other tribes and settled in the land of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-11.htm">2 Chronicles 30:11, 18</a>, 31; 31:1; though by Wellhausen, Smend, and others, such passages are pronounced unhistorical). On the second stick also the prophet was directed to write; but whether <span class="cmt_word">For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and</span> for (or, <span class="accented">of</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>all the house of Israel his companions</span> (Authorized and Revised Versions), or "For Joseph and the whole house of Israel" (Keil), or simply "For Joseph" (Ewald, Havernick, Smend), cannot be determined. Each interpretation can be supported by quite reasonable considerations. For the first may be pleaded that it best accords with the natural sense of the text; for the second, that the phrase, <span class="accented">the stick of Ephraim</span>, appears to be explanatory of and in opposition to "For Joseph;" for the third, that <span class="accented">all the house of Israel</span> stands, like "Ephraim," under the regimen of "stick." The introduction of Joseph as the representative of the northern kingdom rests, not on the fact that Joseph's was the most honorable name among the ten tribes (Havernick), but on the circumstance that the tribe of Joseph, as represented by Ephraim and Manasseh, constituted the main body of the northern kingdom. The addition of Ephraim's name is best accounted for by remembering that in his hand lay the hegemony of the kingdom. "All the house of Israel his companions" signified the rest of the ten tribes. That the two sticks, when joined together in the prophet's hand, were to become one cannot signify that they were then and there to be miraculously united. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-17.htm">Ezekiel 37:17</a></div><div class="verse">And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand.</div><div class="comm">

The suggestion that such a request would be preferred to Ezekiel makes it clear he was meant to perform the symbolic action in public. That his countrymen should fail to understand this action accorded with their proverbial dullness of apprehension (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-9.htm">Ezekiel 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a>). In explanation, the prophet was enjoined to <span class="cmt_word">say unto them</span>, while holding the sticks in his hand, that just as he had made the sticks one in his hand, so would God make one in his hand the two kingdoms symbolized by the sticks. The union of the sticks was to be Ezekiel's work (ver. 17, "in thy hand"); the union of the kingdoms should be Jehovah's (ver. 19, "in my hand"). The separation of the kingdoms had been Ephraim's doing ("in the hand of Ephraim"); their combination should be God's ("in my hand"). Their severance had been effected, on the part of Ephraim, by an unlawful breaking off from the house of Judah, and the establishment of an independent kingdom; their unification should be brought about by the putting down of Ephraim, and the confirming of the crown rights of Judah. The translation, <span class="cmt_word">And will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah</span>, signifying "And will put the tribes of Israel with him." <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the tribe of Judah, supported by the LXX., and preferred by Ewald, Smend, and others, is superior to that of the Revised Version margin, "And will put them together with it, unto [or, ' to be'] the stick of Judah." Keil s rendering, "I will take the stick of Joseph... and the tribes of Israel his companions, which I put thereon [literally, 'and I put them,' viz. the tribes, 'upon <span class="accented">it</span>,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the stick of Joseph] with the stick of Judah," is too involved.

The first step should be the bringing of the people home to their own land (vers. 21, 22); the second, their purification from idolatry (ver. 23); the third, the installation over them, thus united and purified, of one King, the ideal David of the future, or the Messiah (vers. 24, 25); the fourth, the establishment with them of Jehovah's covenant of peace (ver. 26), and the permanent erection amongst them of Jehovah's temple (vers. 27, 28). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21, 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will take the children of Israel from among the heathen</span>. That tills promise was intended to find an initial and partial fulfillment in the return from Babylon is undoubted. That it was also designed to look across the centuries towards the final ingathering of God's spiritual Israel into their permanent inheritance, the heavenly Canaan, an examination of its terms shows. These clearly presuppose a wider dispersion of Israel than had then, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in Ezekiel's day, taken place; and that Israel has never yet been made <span class="cmt_word">one nation upon the mountains of Israel</span>, is incontestable. Nor is there ground for expecting she ever will be. Not even after the exile closed did all Israel return to Palestine. Nor did it ever come true in their experience that one king was king to them all, since, in point of fact, they never afterwards had an earthly sore-reign at all who was properly independent. If, therefore, the prince who in the future should shepherd them was not to be a temporal monarch, but the Messiah, the probability is that the Israel he should shepherd was designed to be, not Israel after the flesh, but Israel after the spirit, who should walk in his judgments and observe his statutes, and <span class="accented">who</span>, in the fullness of the times, should develop out into the Christian Church. Hence it seems reasonable to conclude that <span class="cmt_word">their own land</span>, into which they should eventually be brought, would be not so much the veritable soil from which their ancestors had been expelled, as the country or region in which the new, rejuvenated, reunited, and reformed Israel should dwell, which, again, should be n territory cleansed from sin and idolatry, so as to render it a fit abode for a people devoted to righteousness. Viewed in this light, <span class="accented">their own land</span> was first Canaan, in so far as after the exile it was cleansed from idolatry; now it is those portions of the earth in which the Christian Church has been planted, so far as these are influenced by the holy principles of religion; finally, it will be the new heavens and the new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness (scrap. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-24.htm">Ezekiel 34:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>).

The idea is, as Schroder suggests, the localization of transgression which is viewed as proceeding from the dwelling-places in which it is committed; or, according to Plumptre, the conception is that, as their habitations had formerly been contaminated by their detestable things, "the worship of teraphim and such like, if not worse," so Jehovah would save them from that contamination.

Although this oracle is unaccompanied by any note of time, it was obviously delivered before the twenty-fifth year of the Captivity (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), and most likely in immediate succession to the preceding prophecy, with which also it has a close relation in respect of purport, being designed to show that against restored and united Israel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> against the Church of God of the future, the strongest combinations of hostile force would not prevail, but would fall back defeated and self-destroyed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set thy face against</span> (or, toward) <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. Although occurring in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-4.htm">1 Chronicles 5:4</a> as the name of a Reubenite, Gog was probably a title formed by Ezekiel himself from the word <span class="accented">Magog</span>, the syllable <span class="accented">ma</span> being treated as equivalent to "land." A similar freedom appears to have been exercised by the author of the Apocalypse, who out of Magog, here a territorial designation, makes a military power co-ordinate with Gog (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>). That Gog was not an actual person - though the name reminds one of that of the Lydian king Gyges, as it appears on the monuments, <span class="accented">Gu-gu</span>, <span class="accented">Gu-ug-gu</span>, aud of that of one <span class="accented">Sa-gi</span>, or <span class="accented">Sa-agi</span>, the ruler of another Eastern territory not yet identified (see Schrader, 'Die Keilinschriften und dos Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' first series, vol. 9:46) - but an ideal character, must be held as proved by the composite structure of his army, which was drawn from the four comers of the globe, as well as by the highly imaginative texture of the whole prophecy, which, as Hengstenberg properly remarks, has a thoroughly "utopian [perhaps better, 'ideal'] character," showing that it moves "in the region of holy fancy." The words, <span class="cmt_word">the land of Magog</span>, are not, with Havernick, Ewald, and Smend, to be interpreted as the local or geographical terminus of the prediction, as if the word of God had said, "Set thy face toward Gog, toward the laud of Magog;" but, with the majority of expositors, as a territorial designation signifying that Gog was in or of the laud of Magog, which is here marked with the article, probably to identify it with the well-known Magog mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>, along with Tubal and Mesech as among the descendants of Japheth. From the circumstance that in the table of nations Magog stands between Gomer (the Cimmerians) and Madai (the Medians), and that Gomer appears in Gog's army, it has been not unreasonably concluded that to Ezekiel Magog represented a fierce Northern tribe, most likely, as Josephus ('Ant.,' 1:06. 1) asserts, the Scythians, whose territories lay upon the borders Of the sea of Azov and in the Caucasus. Plumptre even thinks that, "placed as Ezekiel was, he may well have come into contact with these Scythian tribes, either as part of Nebuchadnezzar's army or by a journey on his part into the regions north of Ararat" ('Ezekiel: an Ideal Biography,' <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 8. p. 291, second series). Yet, could both of these hypotheses be established, it would not follow that Ezekiel was thinking merely, as Knobel and Gesenius suppose, of a future struggle which Israel should have to maintain against these <span class="accented">genres Scythicas immanes et innumerabiles</span>, as Jerome in his day described them. In addition to being named from his land, Gog is further distinguished by the peoples over whom he rules, Ezekiel styling him <span class="cmt_word">the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal</span> - a translation adhered to by Hengstenberg, Ewald, and Smend; or, according to the LXX., which most expositors and the Revised Version follow, <span class="accented">the prince of Rosh</span>, <span class="accented">Meshech</span>, <span class="accented">and Tubal</span>. The former rendering is obtained by interpreting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> after the analogy of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "chief priest," or "minister," in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>; and is supported by a similar use of the word <span class="accented">rosh</span> on coins under the government of the Persian satraps; yet the second rendering is not devoid of considerations that may be urged in its favor. Besides being grammatically possible, it yields a souse which is not improbable. Byzantine and Arabian writers of the tenth century were acquainted with a people called <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3a1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, who were Scythian mountaineers, dwelling north of the Taurus, on the shores of the Black Sea and on the banks of the Volga. The Koran speaks of a land of Ras not far from the Araxes. Whether either of these can be connected with present-day Russians, as Gesenius suggests - an hypothesis which Hengstenberg protests deals hardly with the poor Russians - must be left undecided. So must the question whether the people inquired after can be identified, as Delitzsch suggests, with the inhabitants of the land of Raseh (<span class="accented">mat Ra-a-si</span>) of the Inscriptions, which was Situated on the confines of Elam on the Tigris (see Schrader, 'Die Keilin-schriften und das Alto Testament,' p. 427; and comp. 'Records of the Past,' vol. 9. p. 84, 11. 122, 124). At the same time, Jerome's objection will scarcely hold good against understanding Resh as the name of a people, viz. that the Bible elsewhere has no knowledge of any such people, since, as Havernick observes, "one cannot know beforehand whether to Ezekiel, in his then place of abode, the knowledge of such a people was not likely sooner to come than to any Old Testament writer," and it is certain that the Book of Ezekiel is not wanting in names that occur only once, as e.g. Chilmad (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-23.htm">Ezekiel 27:23</a>) and Chub (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a>). Hitzig points out that in <a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>, along with Mesech and Tubal, is mentioned a third nation, <span class="accented">Tiras</span>, which Yon Hammer has attempted to connect with Rosh; while Schroder sees in Rosh (allied to Ross, "horse") an indication that the people were equestrian in their habits, like the Scythians. The other peoples, Meshech and Tubal, were undoubtedly the Mosohians and Tibarenes, <span class="accented">who</span>, according to Herodotus (3:94; 7:78), dwelt south of the Black Sea. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-3.htm">Ezekiel 38:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am against thee, O Gog</span>. Just because Gog was against Israel, Jehovah was against Gog. Gog's invasion of Israel's land would be a declaration of war against Israel's God. so that the conflict would rather be between Jehovah and Gog than between Israel and Gog. Hence throughout this prophecy Jehovah is represented as the principal actor on the side of Israel, who seeks her defense not in walls and bulwarks or in earthly alliances and military combinations, s in the days of the monarchy before the exile, but in the presence of Jehovah in her midst. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts <i>of armour, even</i> a great company <i>with</i> bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will turn thee back</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> (pilel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, and signifying "to cause to return") has by Hitzig, Havernick, Ewald, and Keil, been interpreted in the sense of "enticing," "misleading," decoying to a dangerous enterprise, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/47-10.htm">Isaiah 47:10</a>; but the ordinary meaning seems sufficient, that Jehovah would turn him back from his own self-devised career, or turn him about like a wild beast, putting hooks into his jaws (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-29.htm">Isaiah 37:29</a>), and so compelling him to follow the lead of a power superior to himself. It is as evident that a turning back from the Holy Land cannot be intended, as it is that a turning back to the Holy Land is unsuitable, unless, with Hengstenberg and Ewald, one regards Gog as the Chaldeans, or, with Hitzig, and Schroder, as the Scythiaus, though these latter never were in Palestine, having left it unvisited in their campaign in  <span class="date">B.C. 626</span>, and had not as yet formed the design of invading Israel. Smend is not wide of the mark in suggesting that the thought expressed in the verb is simply that of the superior might of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">I will bring thee forth</span>. That the power which stirs up Gog is here represented as that of Jehovah, while in <a href="../../par/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a> it is affirmed to be that of Satan, need occasion no more difficulty than the similar statements, in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>, about God and in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a> about Satan, stirring up David to number Israel. The enumeration of <span class="cmt_word">horses and horsemen</span> in Gog's army points to the Scythians, who, according to Herodotus (4:46, 136), were mostly equestrian tribes, although the Scythian remains discovered at Kerteh do not give an example of a Scythian horse-archer (see Rawlinson's 'Herodotus,' vol. 3. p. 34, note 6). <span class="cmt_word">All of them clothed with all sorts</span> of armor, better, <span class="accented">clothed with perfection</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> splendidly attired, <span class="accented">all of them</span>. A characteristic of the Assyrian army (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-12.htm">Ezekiel 23:12</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>). The arms of the warlike host - <span class="cmt_word">a great company</span>, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>, "the number of whom is as the sand of the sea")  - are described as consisting of bucklers, <span class="accented">or</span> shields large enough to cover the whole of the soldier, and not so suitable for cavalry as for infantry (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-24.htm">Ezekiel 23:24</a>); shields, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> bucklers of smaller size than the proceeding, such as Assyrian warriors were accustomed to carry (Sayce, 'Assyria, its Princes, Priests, and People,' p. 126); and swords, or weapons for laying waste. The Assyrian soldiery employed "the short dagger, or dirk, and the sword, which was of two kinds. The ordinary kind was long and straight, the less usual kind being curved, like a scimitar" ('Assyria, its Princes,' etc.). In connection with the allied nations in ver. 5, only the small "shield" and "helmet" are mentioned.

The first three are portrayed as armed <span class="cmt_word">with</span> <span class="cmt_word">shield and helmet</span>, or more accurately as being <span class="accented">all of them shield and helmet</span>, which might signify that they should serve as a shield and helmet to Cog, who in truth should be unto them and their confederates a guard; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Keil and Schroder, one who keeps watch over them; according to Miehaelis and Havernick, one who gives them law; according to Hengstenberg, one who is their authority; according to Ewald and Smend, one who serves to them as an ensign, t.&cent;. acts to them as a leader or commander. The LXX. translation, with which Hitzig agrees, "And thou shalt be to me for a guard," is manifestly wrong.

The principal controversy raised by these words is as to whether they signify, as Hitzig, Fairbairn, and Kliefoth suppose, that after many days Gog should be entrusted with the command of the aforementioned nations, or, as Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, Plumptre, and Currey  translate, that Gog, who intended to visit Israel, should himself be visited, in the sense of being punished. In support of the former rendering appeal is taken to <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>; and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>; but the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> when used in this sense is commonly followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> with the accusative of that or those with reference to which or whom the appointment is made or commission issued, and in addition no such commission with reference to these other nations was ever given by God to Gog. In vindication of the second meaning of the words, <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a> and Isaiah 29:6 are ordinarily quoted: while in answer to the objection that it is too soon to talk of punishment for an offense not yet committed, it is customary to reply that, as Jehovah's stirring up of Gog was the first step towards his ultimate overthrow, that stirring up might fairly be described as at least the beginning of his judicial visitation. Havernick's translation, "For a long time thou wilt be missed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> considered as a people that has utterly vanished," is forced; Smend's is better, "After many days thou shalt be mustered," or numbered. In any case Gog's first movement should take place <span class="cmt_word">in the latter years</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at the end of the years</span> - a frequent prophetic phrase (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>), here denoting the Messianic era, and should assume the form of an invasion of the land of Israel, which is next described by a threefold characterization. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As a land brought back from the sword</span>, not in the sense of its people having been made to desist from war, through being henceforth peacefully inclined (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>), or of their having ceased to expect war, because of living ever after securely (ver. 11), but in that of having been recovered from its devastations (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3-5</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a land whose inhabitants had been <span class="cmt_word">gathered out of many nations</span> - a phrase, which while starting from and including the return from Babylon, manifestly looked beyond that event to the wider dispersion of Israel that should precede the final ingathering; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a land whose <span class="cmt_word">mountains had been always waste</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for a waste continually</span>. If such was their condition prior to the return from captivity, it is undeniable that such has practically been their condition ever since, and such it is likely to continue to be, until the final ingathering of the dispersed of Israel.

Taken together, the images suggest that Gog's invasion should burst forth suddenly, rage violently, spread quickly, alarm greatly, but cease finally. Storms roar and crash, alarm and destroy, but do not continue. Clouds diffuse gloom and fear, but ultimately disperse.

All are depicted as following in the wake of Gog, like vultures in the rear of an army, and as inquiring whether Gog had come simply for the purpose of destruction or in the hope of trading with the booty he should capture. In this case they intimate their wish to be partakers of the spoil This (Plumptre), rather than the thirst for booty which characterized them (Keil), their question to Gog signified; Schroder's idea, that they purposed ironically to ridicule the smallness of the spoil which would reward so gigantic an expedition, has as little to recommend it as Kliefoth's suggestion, that they designed to intimate their sympathy with Gog's invasion of Israel.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-17.htm">Ezekiel 38:17</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; <i>Art</i> thou he of whom I have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which prophesied in those days <i>many</i> years that I would bring thee against them?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou he of whom I have spoken in old time</span>? As no existing prophecy, prior to Ezekiel's time, mentions Cog by name, it must be concluded either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that Ezekiel refers to prophecies known in his day, though no longer extant; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that his words simply mean that earlier prophets had predicted such an invasion of Israel in the last times as that which he announces under the leadership of Gog. The former opinion, though countenanced by Ewald, Kuenen, and Smend, is less probable than the latter, which expositors both ancient and modern favor. Schroder considers the hypothesis that earlier prophets had spoken of Gog by name as excluded by the interrogatory form of the sentence, since, had Cog been thus explicitly pointed out, there would, he thinks, have been no need to ask, "Art thou he?" But it is doubtful if the interrogatory form of the words had any other intention than to lend emphasis to the assertion that Gog was he to whom the earlier prophets had unconsciously referred. As to which earlier prophets he alluded opinions vary. Ewald cites <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-4.htm">Isaiah 17:4</a>; Smend adding <a href="../../par/micah/5-11.htm">Micah 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; Keil, <a href="../../par/isaiah/25-5.htm">Isaiah 25:5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-23.htm">Jeremiah 30:23</a>, 25; Joel 4:2, 11, etc.; Hengstenberg, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24.htm">Isaiah 24-27</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>; and Fairbairn, <a href="../../par/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17-24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-28.htm">Isaiah 14:28-32</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/18.htm">Isaiah 18</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3.htm">Joel 3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44, 45</a>; though Schroder is probably correct in holding that all should be included which represent the hostility of the heathen world as culminating in the latter days in a grand concentrated attack upon Israel. Smend sees in the unusual phenomenon that Ezekiel reflects upon earlier prophecies an indication of the declining spirit of prophetism; it should, however, rather be regarded as a sign of superior spiritual insight on the part of Ezekiel, who could discern that from the first the prophets had been guided in their utterances by One who was intimately acquainted with the whole world-program, and knew the end from the beginning, so that however dark and enigmatical their predictions might be when taken separately, when viewed in connection they were recognized as forming parts of a harmonious whole. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, <i>that</i> my fury shall come up in my face.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - Vers. 18 and 19 are not, as Hitzig, Kliefoth, and others explain, on the ground of the perfect, "I have spoken" (ver. 19), which, however, is rather a prophetical present - a free recapitulation of the earlier predictions, but a direct announcement through Ezekiel that when Gog should arrive upon the scene Jehovah should take the field against him, so that he should have to fight against Jehovah rather than against Israel. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">my fury shall come up in my face</span>; or, <span class="accented">my</span> wrath <span class="accented">ascends in rail nose</span>, has parallels in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-8.htm">Ezekiel 24:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>; and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, and describes the vehement breathing (inhalation and exhalation) of an angry man through his nose. <span class="cmt_word">The fire of Jehovah's wrath</span> (comp.

Grounding upon what occurred at Sinai (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>), Hebrew writers generally depicted special interpositions of Jehovah as being witnessed to and accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-13</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>); and in the same manner does Ezekiel delineate Jehovah's intervention in behalf of Israel and against Gog, as so alarming that all living creatures, irrational as well as rational - <span class="cmt_word">fishes of the sea, fowls of the heaven, beasts of the field, creeping things that creep upon the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">ground - adamah</span>), and men upon the face of the earth; or, <span class="accented">ground</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>) - should shake at its accompanying manifestations, and that even the mightiest objects in nature, such as the <span class="cmt_word">mountains, steep places</span>, or, "reek-clefts" (Ewald), such elevations as can only be ascended by means of steps as by a ladder (comp. <a href="../../par/songs/2-14.htm">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and walls</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>), including natural ramparts as well as humanly constructed erections, should be overthrown (ver. 20).

The consternation produced by Jehovah's interposition should be such that the ranks of Gog should fall into utter confusion, and his warriors exterminate each other, as did the Midianites in the days of Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>), and the Moabites, Ammonites, and Seiritea, who invaded Judah in the reign of Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-23.htm">2 Chronicles 20:23</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-9.htm">Ezekiel 39:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven years:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10</span> set forth as the first proof of the greatness of Gog's overthrow the immense booty in the shape of weapons of war which should be obtained by the inhabitants of the cities of Israel. So huge should be the quantity of weapons left behind by the slain, that the Israelites should <span class="cmt_word">burn them with fire seven years</span>. This burning of the weapons has been explained by Havernick, on the ground that weapons of war, as incompatible with Messianic times, should be no more required (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>); by Ewald, as in accordance with the custom of the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-5.htm">Isaiah 9:5</a>) and other ancient peoples (Livy, 38:23; Virgil, 'AEneid,' 8:562); by Hitzig and Smend, as prompted by the consideration that Israel, for whom Jehovah had fought, should have no further need of weapons; by Schroder, as indicating that for Israel these warlike instruments should then so completely lose their power to terrify that they might be looked upon simply as so much firewood; and by Keil, as designed to annihilate the enemy and remove every trace of him. Kliefoth appears nearest the mark, in suggesting that the emphasis lies upon the length of time the burning should continue; and that this was intended, by conveying an idea of the vastness of the spoil, to represent the thoroughness of Gog's destruction and of Israel's deliverance. That the whole delineation is symbolical appears from the number of years the weapons are said to serve for fuel, viz. seven, and from the character of the weapons themselves, which, if not entirely wooden, were at least all combustible. Of the "armor" generally (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>, "something joined," from a root signifying "to join") the pieces mentioned - <span class="cmt_word">the shields and the bucklers</span> (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>), <span class="cmt_word">the bows and arrows</span> (see ver. 3), <span class="cmt_word">the hand-staves</span>, or, <span class="accented">javelins</span> (margin), perhaps, as Hitzig and Smend suggest, the staff with which a horseman strikes his beast (see <a href="../../par/numbers/22-27.htm">Numbers 22:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and the spears</span> - were mostly composed of timber. When all should have been given to the flames, it would then appear that on their late owners the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span> had worked out its literal avengement, that they who had intended to despoil Israel were themselves spoiled; and they who hoped to plunder Israel were themselves plundered (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-14.htm">Isaiah 17:14</a>).

Concerning both the designation and the site of this divinely provided sepulcher controversy has arisen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">As to its site</span>. The notion of Michaelis and Eiehhom, that <span class="cmt_word">the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea</span> was in some way related to the mountains of Abarim mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-49.htm">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>, and that of Hitzig, that it signified "the valley of the opposite heights," as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a>, and was to be sought for in the "very great valley" of <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, may at once be dismissed - the former as untenable, and -the latter as far-fetched. The suggestion of Hengstenberg and Kliefoth, that by the burial-place of Gog was meant the valley of Megiddo, where Josiah fell in battle against Pharaoh-Necho (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>), derives support from these considerations, that the very name of Megiddo points to battles, that in its vicinity are found such passes as are here described, and that its modern designation <span class="accented">Lejun</span> (<span class="accented">Leqio</span>), in all probability contains a reminiscence of the present passage. It is, however, open to the obvious objections that the place of Gog's burial was not contiguous to the field of his overthrow, and that the clause locating it "on the <span class="accented">east of the sea</span>," by which on this hypothesis must be understood the Mediterranean, is rather descriptive of the entire land than of any particular spot therein. Hence the view of Havernick, Ewald, Keil, and Smoud, which finds the valley in the neighborhood of the Dead Sea, is to be preferred, though, even with agreement as to this, interpreters are not unanimous as to the spot intended. Ewald thinks of "the horrible, unwholesome valley over against the sea, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-8.htm">Ezekiel 47:8</a>) the Dead Sea, that valley which covers the ancient overbearing ones (<span class="accented">die Zerreisenden</span>), the Sodomites, who resemble these;" Keil, translating <span class="accented">kidmath</span> as "in front of," holds by "the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea;" Havernick and Smend advocate "a place outside the Holy Land," though the clause, "a grave in Israel," seems against this. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' hints, net without reason, that the valley was "imaginary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">As to its designation</span>. That in the word "passengers" lies a paronomasia is apparent; but whether threefold or only twofold is uncertain. In the present verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> may signify either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> such travelers as were wont to pass through the valley (Keil), which is the obvious and natural interpretation; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the warriors of Gog (Ewald, Hitzig), who intended to pass through the land, but whose invasion had only proved a passing storm; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the commissioners who should be appointed to pass through the land in search of bones (ver. 15). The notion of Ewald, who derives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and translates "haughty," "overbearing," meaning the Gogites, is countenanced by no ether expositor. If the first sense be taken, then the verse will read, "The valley of the passers through, and it (the valley, in consequence of having become the grave of Gog) stops (the way of) the passers through;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it becomes thereafter impassable for travelers (Rosenm&uuml;ller, Keil); or, it stops the noses, or breath, of such travelers by reason of its horrible stench (Ewald, Havernick). If the second meaning be selected, the valley must be understood to have afterwards received its name from the fact that Gog's warriors lay entombed beneath its sod, and "the stopping of the passengers" to signify that whereas Gog purposed to overrun the land, his destructive career was there ignominiously arrested (Schroder). If the third rendering be preferred, then the valley will be held to have derived its designation, after the event, from the passing through it or through the land of the searchers, in which case the stepping of the passengers can only have alluded to the fact that, as the "buriers" proceeded with the work of interment, they were compelled to turn away their faces and stop their noses because of the noisome effluvium which arose from the corpses. The first interpretation is the best, though the first and second might be combined by making the first "passengers" stand for the travelers and the second for the invaders, whose career should there be stopped; and to this view a certain countenance is lent by the statements which follow, that there should <span class="cmt_word">Gog and all his multitude</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all his noisy tumult - be</span> buried, and that the valley ever afterwards should bear the name of <span class="cmt_word">Hamon-gog</span>, or, <span class="accented">Gog</span> <span class="accented">s multitude</span>.

It is impossible to decide dogmatically in a question of so much difficulty; but the Revised Version appears to present the most exact rendering of the Hebrew, and upon the whole the most intelligible account of what was intended to take place, viz. the appointment of a special body of commissioners, who should be designated both "passengers," in ironical allusion to Gog who had meant to pass through the land, and "buffers," from the nature of the task delegated to them, viz. the interment of the "passengers," i.e. the Gogites, and who should begin their work after the main body of the slain had been removed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the end of the seven months of burying.

They should learn that if Israel had for a season been abandoned to the sword and driven into exile, it was not because of Jehovah's inability to protect them, but because of their wickedness which had caused him to hide his face from them - an expression which in Ezekiel occurs only here and in ver. 29, though it is found in the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17, 18</a>) and in the older prophets (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-8.htm">Isaiah 54:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-17.htm">Isaiah 57:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-7.htm">Isaiah 64:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-5.htm">Jeremiah 33:5</a>).

It is in substance a recapitulation of God's gracious promise to bring again the captivity of Israel, of which the prophet had just been reminded in ver. 23, and to which accordingly he now in thought goes back. It traces the whole course of the Divine dealings with the nation from the point of the exile onwards. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will bring again the captivity of Jacob</span>. (For the use of "Jacob" as a designation of the people, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>.)

That its fulfillment began with the return from Babylon is not inconsistent with the view that its fulfillment will terminate with the final ingathering of Israel out of the nations by her conversion to Christianity, and her consequent admission to the Church. That its first cause will be "mercy" to the whole house of Israel will not prevent that cause from being at the same time a jealous regard for the Divine holiness (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21, 22</a>).

The captivity of Israel would not be brought back until her people had been thoroughly chastised for their iniquities, and that chastisement had wrought in them a spirit of penitence and a disposition towards obedience. Then should Jehovah interpose for their deliver-ante by gathering them out of their enemies' lands and leading them back to their own land; and these two experiences, the  Captivity and the Restoration, the driving out and the bringing in, should complete their conversion to Jehovah, and secure their perpetual enjoyment of Jehovah's favor.

Already Jehovah had promised to put his Spirit in his people (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-14.htm">Ezekiel 37:14</a>); now the fact that he has implemented that promise by a copious effusion of the same he cites as a proof that Israel shall no more forfeit his favor because no more shall she forsake his ways (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-21.htm">Isaiah 59:21</a>). The same promise had been previously given by Joel (<a href="../../par/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>), and was afterwards renewed by Zechariah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). The citation of Joel's words by Peter on the Day of Pentecost (<a href="../../par/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>) shows that he regarded the remarkable effusion of the Holy Ghost on that memorable occasion as a fulfillment of the premise here recorded by Ezekiel. Yet the promise was not then exhausted. Rather it has often since been implemented, and will doubtless receive its consummation in the New Jerusalem. "No historical Church, Jewish or Gentile," writes Plumptre, "has ever yet realized the picture here sketched by Ezekiel. We ask, as before - Will it ever be realized on earth? or must we look for it only in the heavenly city whose Builder and Maker is God?" <span class="cmt_word">NOTE.</span> - In addition to what has been stated at the beginning of this prophecy (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-1.htm">Ezekiel 38:1</a>) with reference to the general significance of this invasion by and overthrow of Cog, that it points to some tremendous conflict in the latter days between the powers of the world and the Church of Christ, a few words may be offered in support of the preposition that nevertheless there is no reason to expect that this conflict will take the form of an actual invasion of the land of Israel or of a real fire-and-sword battle with the Church, or that Gog will step upon the field as a veritable flesh-and-blood personality, and his armies find a grave in the manner sketched by the prophet. That the whole delineation is symbolic, and embodies spiritual truths under material emblems, will hardly be doubted by one who impartially weighs the following considerations, which have been admirably brought together by Fairbairn. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The designation given to the great assailant of the latter times -  Gog, which discovers itself to be an ideal name, if by nothing else by the manner in which it has been formed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The composition of his army, which is drawn from the four quarters of the globe, in fact, from the extremities of the earth, and consists of peoples not only remote from one another, but "the most unlike naturally to act in concert for any particular purpose." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The object of his attack - the land of Israel, a territory so small that it is inconceivable a host so great should have been required to capture it, and so poor that had the invaders got all it contained it "could not have served to maintain them for a single day." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The fruits of Israel's victory - firewood for seven years out of the enemies' weapons, and seven months of labor in burying their corpses. "It would be but a very moderate allowance, on the literal supposition, to say that a million of men would thus be engaged, and that on an average each would consign two corpses to the tomb in one day; which for the hundred and eighty working days of the seven months would make an aggregate of three hundred and sixty millions of corpses! Then the putrefaction, the pestilential vapors arising from such masses of slain victims, before they were all buried. Who could live at such a time?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The impossibility of harmonizing prophecy on the hypothesis that Ezekiel's picture must receive a literal interpretation, since Isaiah (Isaiah 34.), Joel (Joel 3:12, 14), and Zechariah (Zechariah 14), who all appear to depict the same conflict as Ezekiel portrays, each pitches its scene in a different locality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The gross carnality of the whole picture on the assumption that it must be literally interpreted, which is wholly inconsistent with that spirituality one associates with the Messianic times.

In substance the command was equivalent to that of <a href="../../par/revelation/22-18.htm">Revelation 22:18, 19</a>. The true prophet does not choose his message (<a href="../../par/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>); his "meat" is to do his Lord's will (<a href="../../par/john/4-34.htm">John 4:34</a>), and he takes what he "finds" as given to him by that will.

They are reproduced yet more closely by St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/10-9.htm">Revelation 10:9</a>). There is, after the first terror is over, an infinite sweetness in the thought of being a fellow worker with God, of speaking his words and not our own. In the case of St. John, the first sweetness was changed to bitterness as soon as he had eaten it; and this is, perhaps, implied here also in ver. 14. The first ecstatic joy passed away, and the former sense of the awfulness of the work returned.

The thought implied is that Ezekiel's mission, as to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), was outwardly easier than if he had been sent to the heathen. With Israel there was at least the medium of a speech common both to the prophet and his hearers. In ver. 6 the thought is enlarged by the use of "many peoples." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-6.htm">Ezekiel 3:6</a></div><div class="verse">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand.

The margin of the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">If I had sent thee to them, would they not have hearkened</span>, etc.? expresses the same meaning, but is less tenable as a translation. The thought in either case finds its analogue in our Lord's reference to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Tyre and Sidon (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12-14</a>).

Those who had despised the voice of Jehovah, speaking in his Law, or directly to the hearts of his people, were not likely to listen with a willing ear to his messenger. We are reminded of our Lord's words to his disciples in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24, 25</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Impudent and hard-hearted;</span> literally (the word is not the same as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>), in Revised Version, <span class="accented">of an hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</span> The word "hard" is the same word as the first half of Ezekiel's name, and is probably used with reference to it as in the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-8.htm">Ezekiel 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have made thy face strong;</span> literally, as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">hard.</span> Ezekiel's name was at once <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> Hard as Israel might be, he could be made <span class="accented">harder, i.e.</span> stronger, than they, end should prevail against them (compare the parallels of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-7.htm">Isaiah 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>). The boldness of God's prophets is a strictly supernatural gift. Whatever persistency there may be in evil, they will be able to meet it, perhaps to overcome it, by a greater persistency in good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-9.htm">Ezekiel 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they <i>be</i> a rebellious house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Adamant</span>. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">shemir</span> is used in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> (where the Authorized Version gives "diamond" for a stone used in engraving on gems. In <a href="../../par/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> it appears, as it does here, as a type of exceeding hardness. It is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament. It is commonly identified with the stone known as <span class="accented">corundum</span>, which appears in some of its forms as the sapphire and the Oriental ruby, and also as the stone the powder of which is used as emery. The special point of the comparison is, of course, that the adamant was actually used to cut either flint itself or stones as hard as flint. <span class="cmt_word">Neither be dismayed at their looks.</span> The words indicate the extreme sensitiveness of the prophet's natural temperament. He had shrunk not only from the threats and revilings of the rebellious house, but even from their scowls of hatred.

The prophet was not to pick and choose out of the message, but was to deliver "all the counsel of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Take into thine heart,</span> etc. An inverted order of the two commands would, perhaps, have seemed more natural. What we actually find, however, is sufficiently suggestive. The message of Jehovah is first received into the inner depths of the soul, but in that stage it is vague, undefined, incommunicable. It needs to be clothed in articulate speech before it can be heard with the mental ear and passed on to others. The mouth speaks out of the fulness of the heart.

He is sent "to them of the Captivity." They are the rebellious house. There is an obvious significance in the phrase, "<span class="accented">thy</span> people." Jehovah can no longer recognize them as his. The words of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a> are repeated. Here also, even among the exiles, who were better than those that remained in Judah, he was to expect partial failure, but he was not, on that account, to shirk the completion of his task. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord God;</span> <span class="accented">Adonai Jehovah</span>, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>.

Luther, however, gives "a wind lifted me up." The parallels of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a> (where, however, we have the addition, "in the visions of God") and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a> suggest the conclusion that this was a purely subjective sensation, that it was one of the phenomena of the ecstatic state, and that there was no actual change of place. On the other hand, the use of like language in the cases of Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-12.htm">1 Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-16.htm">2 Kings 2:16</a>), of our Lord (<a href="../../par/mark/1-12.htm">Mark 1:12</a>), of Philip (<a href="../../par/acts/8-39.htm">Acts 8:39</a>), would justify the inference that the prophet actually passed from one locality to the other. The language of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a> probably points to the true solution of the problem. The ecstatic state continued, and in it Ezekiel went from the banks of Chebar to the dwellings of the exiles at Tel-Abib (see note on ch. 1.), at some distance from it. <span class="cmt_word">I heard behind me,</span> etc. The words imply that the prophet, either in his vision or in very deed. had turned from the glory of the living creatures and of the wheels, and set his face in the direction in which he was told to go. As he does so, he hears the sounds of <span class="cmt_word">a great rushing</span> (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Luther, "earthquake"), followed by words which, though in the form of a doxology, uttered, it may be presumed, by the living creatures, were also a message of encouragement. His readiness to do his work as a preacher of repentance calls forth the praise of God from those in whose presence there is "joy over one sinner that repenteth." We are reminded of the earthquake in the Mount of Purification and the <span class="accented">Gloria, in excelsis</span> of Dante ('Purg.,' 20:127-141; 21:53-60). The words, <span class="cmt_word">from his</span> <span class="cmt_word">place</span> (belonging, probably, to the narrative rather than the doxology), point, not to the sanctuary at Jerusalem, which Jehovah had forsaken, but to the region thought of as in the north (see note on Ezekiel 1:4), to which he had withdrawn himself. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-13.htm">Ezekiel 3:13</a></div><div class="verse"><i>I heard</i> also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard</span>, etc. There is no verb in the Hebrew, but it may be supplied from ver. 12. We lose in the English the kissing, or touching, poetry of the original, "each its sister." The attitude as of wings raised for flight, and the sound of both the wings and wheels, implied the departure of the glorious vision, presumably to the region from which it came. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-14.htm">Ezekiel 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit lifted me up</span> (see note on ver. 12). Here the LXX. has the more definite phrase, "the Spirit of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">For bitterness</span> (see note on Ezekiel 2:3). <span class="cmt_word">The heat of my spirit.</span> The first noun is here translated literally. Elsewhere it is rendered as "wrath" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), "fury" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>). Here probably it points to the conflict of emotions - indignation against the sins of his people, the dread of failure, the consciousness of unfitness. <span class="cmt_word">The hand of the Lord,</span> etc. The word for "strong" is the same as that which enters into Ezekiel's name. Taking this and ver. 9 into account, there seems sufficient reason for translating as the Vulgate does, <span class="accented">confortans</span> (so Luther, "held me firm"), at least for thinking of that meaning as implied (comp. <a href="../../par/ezra/7-9.htm">Ezra 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a>). There was a sustaining power in spite of the "bitterness" and the "heat." In a more general sense, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>, it is used as implying a special intensity of prophetic inspiration, as in the case of Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-15.htm">2 Kings 3:15</a>); but this is the only case in which it occurs with the adjective "strong." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Tel-Abib,</span> etc., We now enter on the first scene of the prophet's ministry. The LXX. leaves the proper name. The Vulgate rightly translates it as <span class="accented">acervus novarum frugum</span>, the "mound of ears of corn" (the meaning appears in the name of the Passover month, Abib). Luther gives, strangely enough, "where the almond trees stood, in the mouth Abib"). Jerome's suggestion, that here also there was a <span class="accented">nomen et omen.</span> and that those who shared Ezekiel's exile were regarded as the "firstfruits" of the future, is at least ingenious, and finds some support in <a href="../../par/psalms/126-5.htm">Psalm 126:5, 6</a>. The place has not been identified, and its position depends on that of the river with which it is connected (see note on Ezekiel 1:1). The word "Tel" is commonly applied to the mounds formed out of masses of ruins, which are common all over the plains of Mesopotamia. The name in this case may suggest that the earth had gathered over it, and that it was cultivated. <span class="cmt_word">I sat where they sat</span>, etc. The ministry begins not with speech, but silence. Our Western habits hardly enable us to enter into the impressiveness of such a procedure. The conduct of Job's friends (<a href="../../par/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>) presents a parallel, and as Ezekiel seems to have known that book (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</a>), he may have been influenced by it. Like actions meet us in <a href="../../par/ezra/9-3.htm">Ezra 9:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-19.htm">Daniel 4:19</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-16.htm">Ezekiel 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A watchman unto the house of Israel</span>. The seven days' session of amazement came to an end, but even then there was at first no utterance of a message. The word of the Lord came to his own soul, and told him what his special vocation as a prophet was to be. He was to be a "watchman unto the house of Israel." He was, like the watchman of a city on his tower, to be on the look out to warn men against coming dangers, not to slumber on his post. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24-27</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17-20</a> we have vivid pictures of such a work. It had already been used figuratively of the prophet's work by Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-17.htm">Jeremiah 6:17</a>). The cognate verb, with the image fully  developed, meets us in <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. Its use in <a href="../../par/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a> is doubtful as to meaning, and in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-8.htm">Isaiah 52:8</a> and Isaiah 56:10 it may be, if we accept the theory of a Deutero-Isaiah, an echo from Ezekiel. It is reproduced with special emphasis in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2-7</a>. More than any word it describes the special characteristic of Ezekiel's work. He is to watch personally over individual souls. So in a like sense, a corresponding word is used of the Christian ministry in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a> (compare also for the thought, though the word is not the same, <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-11.htm">Isaiah 21:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>). A vivid picture of the work of such a watchman is found, it may be noted, in the opening speech of the 'Agamemnon' of AEschylus. <span class="cmt_word">Give them warning,</span> etc. It is, I think, a legitimate inference that the prophet acted on the command while he was with the exiles and before the departure of ver. 22, not by harangues or sermons addressed to the whole body of the exiles, but by direct warning to individuals. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Ezekiel 3:18</a></div><div class="verse">When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked <i>man</i> shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou givest him not warning,</span> etc. The word, as in the parallels already referral to, is characteristic of Ezekiel, almost indeed, peculiar to him. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-11.htm">Psalm 19:11</a> may be noted as another instance of its use. When the watchman saw danger coming, he was to blow the trumpet (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-3.htm">Ezekiel 33:3-6</a>). The prophet was to speak his warnings. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt surely die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">dying thou shalt die</span>. Were the words of <a href="../../par/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> in the prophet's mind? <span class="cmt_word">To save his life;</span> literally, <span class="accented">for his life</span>, or <span class="accented">that he may live.<span class="cmt_word"></span> Shall die in his iniquity.</span> Do the words refer only to physical death coming as the punishment of iniquity? or do they point onward further to the judgment that follows death, the loss of the inheritance of eternal life which belongs to those whose names are written in the book of life? Looking to the tremendous responsibility implied in the words, we can hardly, I think, in spite of the questions which have been raised as to the belief of the Hebrews in the immortality of the soul, hesitate to accept the latter meaning. Ezekiel anticipates the teaching of <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>, if, indeed, that meaning was not already familiar to him in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32, 33</a>. For "in" his iniquity we may, perhaps, read "because of." The negligence of the watchman does not avail to procure a full pardon for the evil doer. The degree in which it may extenuate his guilt depends on conditions known to God, but not to us. In any case, as in our Lord's words (<a href="../../par/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47, 48</a>), a man's knowledge and opportunities are the measure of his responsibility. But the unfaithful watchman has his responsibility. It is as though the blood of the sinner had been shed. His guilt may be described in the same words as that of Cain (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>). Compare St. Paul's words in <a href="../../par/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a> and Acts 20:26 as echoes of Ezekiel's thought. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-19.htm">Ezekiel 3:19</a></div><div class="verse">Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast delivered thy soul,</span> etc. This phrase is again an eminently characteristic one (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-9.htm">Ezekiel 33:9</a>). Here also, though the words do not necessarily imply more than deliverance from bodily death, thought of as a judgment for negligence, it is, I think, scarcely possible to avoid finding in them a "springing and germinant" sense, analogous to that which we have found in the preceding verse. The dread warning has for its complement a message of comfort. The judgment passed on the prophet does not depend on the results of his ministry. "Whether men will bear, or whether they will forbear," he has "delivered his soul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> saved his life, when he has done his duty as a watchman. The phrase is noticeable as having passed out of the language of Scripture into familiar use. A man can say, "Liberavi animam meam," when he has uttered his conviction on any question of importance affecting the well being of others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-20.htm">Ezekiel 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">Again, When a righteous <i>man</i> doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From his righteousness.</span> The Hebrew gives the plural, "his righteousnesses" - all his single righteous acts that lie behind. <span class="cmt_word">I lay a stumbling block,</span> etc. The word is again characteristic (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3, 4</a>). It occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>, and Ezekiel may have learnt the use of the word from him. It is found also in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-14.htm">Isaiah 57:14</a>; but the date of these, according to the so called higher criticism, may be later than Ezekiel. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>: the word is different. The English word sufficiently expresses the sense. One of the acts of Eastern malignity was to put a stone in a man's way, that he might fall and hurt himself Here the putting the stone is described as the act of Jehovah, and is applied to anything that tempts a man to evil, and so to his own destruction (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-21.htm">Jeremiah 6:21</a>). The thought is startling to us, and seems at variance with true conceptions of the Divine will (<a href="../../par/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13</a>). The explanation is to be found in the fact that the prophet's mind did not draw the distinction which we draw between evil permitted and the same evil decreed. All, from this point of view, is as God wills, and even those who thwart that will are indeed fulfilling it. Glimpses are given of the purpose which leads to the permission or decree. In the case now before us the man has turned from his righteousness before the stumbling block is laid in his way. The temptation is permitted that the man may become conscious of his evil (so <a href="../../par/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>). If the prophet preacher does his duty, the man may conquer the temptation, and the stumbling block may  become a "stepping stone to higher things." If, through the prophet's negligence, h<span class="cmt_word">e</span> comes unwarned, and stumbles and falls, he, as in the case of the wicked, bears the penalty of his guilt, but the prophet has here also the guilt of blood upon his soul. The "righteousnesses" of the man (here, as before, we have the plural), his individual acts of righteousness, shall not be remembered, because he was tried, and found wanting in the essential element of all righteousness. The highest development of the thought is found in the fact that Christ himself is represented as a "stumbling stone" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-32.htm">Romans 9:32, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>). St. Paul's solution of the problem is found in the question, "Have they stumbled that they should fall?" (<a href="../../par/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11</a>). Was that the end contemplated in the Divine purpose Will it really be the end? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-21.htm">Ezekiel 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous <i>man</i>, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a></div><div class="verse">And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of the Lord was there upon me,</span> etc. There is obviously an interval between the fact thus stated and the close of the message borne in on the prophet's soul. Psychologically, it seems probable that the effect of the message was to fill him with an overwhelming, crushing sense of the burden of his responsibility. How was he to begin so terrible a work? What were to be the nearer, and the remoter, issues of such a work? Apparently, at least, he does not then begin it by a spoken warning. He passes, at the Divine command borne in on his soul, from the crowd that had watched him during the seven days' silence, and betakes himself to the solitude of the "plain," as distinct from the "mound" where the exiles dwelt, and there the vision appears again in all points as he had seen it when he stood on the river's bank. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-23.htm">Ezekiel 3:23</a></div><div class="verse">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</div><div class="comm">

There was a time to keep silence, as well as a time to speak (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:7</a>), and for the immediate future silence was the more effective of the two. It would, at least, make them eager to hear what the silence meant. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a></div><div class="verse">But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall put bands</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon thee,</span> etc. Did the warning mean that the prophet's hearers would treat him as the men of Jerusalem treated Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-3.htm">Jeremiah 32:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-1.htm">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>)? Of this, at all events, we have no record, and so far we are led to the other alternative of taking the words (as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-8.htm">Ezekiel 4:8</a>) in a figurative sense. The prophet would feel, as he stood in the presence of the rebellious house, as tongue tied, bound hand and foot by their hardness of heart, teaching by strange and startling signs only, and, it may be, writing his prophecies. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>, four years later, and again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-21.htm">Ezekiel 29:21</a>, we have a distinct reference to a long period of such protracted silence. We may compare, as in some sense parallel, the silence of Zacharias (<a href="../../par/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>). That silence unbroken for nine months was a sign to those who "were looking for redemption in Jerusalem," more eloquent than speech. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a></div><div class="verse">And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they <i>are</i> a rebellious house.</div><div class="comm">

He was to speak out of his own heart. When the "time to speak" came words would be given him (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-19.htm">Matthew 10:19</a>). And those he would then speak would be as the echo of those in ver. 11.

As the last note of time was the twelfth year (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-17.htm">Ezekiel 32:17</a>), it may be assumed the interval was largely occupied in receiving and delivering the prophecies that fall between those dates, though it is more than likely a period of silence preceded the vision of which this last section of the book preserves an account. If not the last of the prophet's utterances (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17</a>), it was beyond question the grandest and most momentous. Accordingly, the prophet notes with his customary exactness that the vision came to him <span class="cmt_word">in the beginning of the year</span>, which Hitzig, whom Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary' follows, believes to have been a jubilee year, which began on the tenth day of the seventh month. As, however, the practice of commencing the year with this month was not introduced among the Jews till after the exile, and as Ezekiel everywhere follows the purely Mosaic arrangement of the year, the presumption is that the beginning of the year here alluded to was the month Abib, and that <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">tenth day of the month</span> was the day on which the Torah enjoined the selection of a lamb for the Passover. Indeed, the two clauses in Ezekiel read like an abbreviation of the Mosaic statute (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2, 3</a>) - a circumstance sufficiently striking and probably significant, though emphasis should not, with Hengstenberg, be laid upon the fact that every word in Ezekiel's copy is found in the Exodus original. On that day, which was the anniversary of the beginning of a merciful deliverance to Israel in Egypt, of the initial step in a gracious process of transforming Pharaoh's captives into a nation, - on that day (for emphasis <span class="cmt_word">the selfsame day</span>, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>), the prophet's soul was rapt into an ecstasy (see on Ezekiel 1:3), in which he seemed to be transported thither, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> towards the smitten city, and a disclosure made to him concerning that new community which Jehovah was about to form out of old Israel.

That this mountain, though resembling the temple hill in Jerusalem, was not that in reality, but "the mountain of the Lord's house" of Messianic times (see on Ezekiel 43:12; and comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-22.htm">Ezekiel 17:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-40.htm">Ezekiel 20:40</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/4-6.htm">Micah 4:6</a>), may be inferred from its greater altitude than that of either Moriah or Zion, which pointed obviously to the loftier spiritual elevation of the new Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">As the frame of a city on the south.</span> What Ezekiel beheld was not "beside" or "by" (Authorized Version), but "on" the mountain, and was not, as Havernick, Ewald, and Kliefoth suppose, the new city of Jerusalem, though this might with a fair measure of accuracy be described as lying south of Moriah on which the temple stood, but the temple itself, which, with its walls and gates, chambers and courts, rose majestically before the prophet's view, with all the magnificence, and indeed (as the particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. indicates), with the external appearance of a city. That the prophet should speak of it as "on the south" receives sufficient explanation from the circumstance that he himself came from the north, and had it always before him in a southerly direction. The idea is correctly enough expressed by the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> of the LXX., which signifies "over against" to one coming from the north.

In his hand he carried a line <span class="cmt_word">of flax and a measuring-reed</span> (<span class="accented">kaneh hammidah</span>, or "reed of measuring," reed having been the customary material out of which such rods were made; compare the Assyrian for a measuring-reed <span class="accented">qanu</span>, the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, and the Latin canna). Possibly he carried these as "emblems of building activity" (Hengstenberg), and because "he had many and different things to measure" (Kliefoth); but most likely the line was meant to measure large dimensions (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>) and such as could not be taken by a straight stick, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the girth of pillars, and the rod to measure smaller dimensions, like those of the gates and walls of the temple. Hitzig's conjecture, that the line was linen because the place to be measured was the sanctuary, whose priests were obliged to clothe themselves in linen, Kliefoth rightly pronounces artificial and inaccurate, since the line was made, not of manufactured flax, or linen, but of the raw material. That the "man" was Jehovah or the Angel of the Presence (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>) the analogy of <a href="../../par/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7, 8</a> and the statement of Ezekiel in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-2.htm">Ezekiel 44:2, 5</a> would seem to suggest; only it is not certain in the last of these passages that the speaker was "the man" and not rather "the God of Israel," who had already taken possession of the house (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-2.htm">Ezekiel 43:2</a>), and whose voice is once at least distinguished from that of the man (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-6.htm">Ezekiel 43:6</a>). Accordingly, Kliefoth, Smend, and others identify the "man" with the ordinary <span class="accented">angelus interpres</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-9.htm">Revelation 21:9</a>). The <span class="cmt_word">gate</span> in which he stood "waiting for the new comer" was manifestly the north gate, since Ezekiel came from the north, though Havernick and Smend put in a plea for the east gate, on the grounds that it was the principal entrance to the sanctuary, and the distance between it and the north gate, five hundred cubits, was too great to be passed over so slightly as in ver. 6.

The "wall" belonged to the outer court; that of the inner court being afterwards mentioned (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-7.htm">Ezekiel 42:7</a>). In having a "wall round about" Jehovah's sanctuary resembled both Greek and Babylonian shrines (see Herod., 1:18; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:126), but differed from both the tabernacle, which had none, and from the Solomonic temple, whose "wall" formed no essential part of the sacred structure, but was more or less of arbitrary erection on the part of Solomon and later kings. Here, however, the wall constituted an integral portion of the whole; and was designed, like that in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-20.htm">Ezekiel 42:20</a>, "to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place," as the Greeks distinguished between the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> (see Thucyd., 4:95). Its breadth and height were the same (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>) - one reed, of <span class="cmt_word">six cubits by the cubit and an hand-breadth</span>; that is to say, each cubit measured an ordinary cubit and a hand-breadth (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>). Hengstenberg suggests that the greater cubit of Ezekiel was borrowed from the Chaldeans; and certainly Herodotus (1. 178) speaks of a royal cubit in Babylon which was three finger-breadths longer than the ordinary measure, while in Egypt also two such cubits of varying lengths were current (Bockhart, 'Metrol. Untersuch,' p. 212); "from which it might be supposed," says Smend, "that the same thing held good for Asia Minor." Still, the hypothesis is likelier that the cubit in question was the old Mosaic cubit - the cubit of a man (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>), equal to the length of the forearm  from the elbow to the end of the longest finger - which was employed in the building of the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>). Assuming the cubit to have been eighteen inches, the height and breadth of the wall would be nine feet - no great elevation, and presenting a striking contrast to the colossal proportions of city walls in Babylon and in Greece (see Herod., 1:170; ' Records of the Past,' vol. 5:127, 1st series), and even of the walls of the first temple in Jerusalem (see Josephus, 'Wars,' 5:1); but in this, perhaps, lay a special significance, since, as the city-like temple stood in no need of walls and bulwarks for defense, the lowness of its walls would permit it the more easily to be seen, would, in fact, make it a conspicuous object to all who might approach it for worship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, <i>which was</i> one reed broad; and the other threshold <i>of the gate, which was</i> one reed broad.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">east gate</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The gate which looketh toward the east</span>; literally, <span class="accented">whose face was toward the east</span>. That this was not the gate in which the angel had been first observed standing seems implied in the statement that he came to it.

The same reasons will explain the fullness of description accorded to it rather than to the others. It was ascended by <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span>, or <span class="accented">steps</span>, of which the number <span class="accented">seven</span> is omitted, though it is mentioned in connection with the north (ver. 22) and south (ver. 26) gates. "The significance was obvious," writes Plumptre. "Men must ascend in heart and mind as they enter the sanctuary, and the seven steps represented the completeness at last of that ascension." The steps lay outside the wall, and at their head had a <span class="cmt_word">threshold</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, properly an "expansion," or "spreading out") <span class="cmt_word">one reed broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> measuring inwards from east to west, the thickness of the wall.

The second portion of the verse, <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gate thirteen cubits</span>, is explained by Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, Keil (with whom Plumptre agrees), as signifying the length of the covered way from the east entrance, since it is supposed the whole length of forty cubits (the length of the gate without the porch) would hardly be roofed in; so that assuming a similar covered way of thirteen cubits at the other end of the gate-building, as one came "from the house," there would be an open space, well, or uncovered courtyard, of fourteen cubits in length and six broad, enclosed on all sides by gate-buildings. The roofs extending from the east and west would be supported on the "posts" of the chambers mentioned in ver. 10. Smend, however, infers, from the windows in the posts within the gate (ver. 16), that the whole extent was roofed in, and accordingly can offer no explanation of the clause; Kliefoth and Schroder prefer to regard the thirteen cubits as the height of the gate, although the word translated "length" never elsewhere has this meaning.

As the barrier projected one cubit on each side of the ten-cubit way, only eight cubits remained for persons going in or out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a></div><div class="verse">He measured then the gate from the roof of <i>one</i> little chamber to the roof of another: the breadth <i>was</i> five and twenty cubits, door against door.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The breadth</span> of the gate from the roof of one little chamber or lodge to another, measuring from door to door, was <span class="cmt_word">five and twenty cubits</span>, which were thus made up: 10 cubits of footway + 12 (2 &times; 6) cubits for the two guard-rooms + 3 (2 &times; say 1.5) cubits for the thickness of the two side walls   =   25 cubits in all. According to ver. 42, the length of a hewn stone was one cubit and a half. The doors from which the measurements were taken must have been in the side walls at the back of the guard- looms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-14.htm">Ezekiel 40:14</a></div><div class="verse">He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the court round about the gate.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made also posts</span>. In using the verb "made" the prophet either went back in thought to the time when the man who then explained the building had fashioned it (Hengstenberg); or he employed the term in the sense of <span class="accented">constituit</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> fixed or estimated, "inasmuch as such a height could not be measured from the bottom to the top with the measuring-red" (Keil). The "posts," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of ver. 9, were sixty cubits high, and corresponded to the towers in modern churches. To the objection sometimes urged against what is called the "exaggerated" height of these columns, Kliefoth replies, "If it had been considered that our church towers have grown up out of gate-pillars, that one can see, not merely in Egyptian obelisks and Turkish minarets, but also in our own hollow factory chimneys, how upon a base of two cubits, square pillars of sixty cubits high can be erected, and that finally the talk is of a colossal building seen in vision, no critical difficulties would have been discovered in this statement as to height." The last clause, <span class="cmt_word">even unto the post of the court round about the gate</span>, should read, <span class="accented">and the court</span> reached <span class="accented">unto the post</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> being used collectively), <span class="accented">the gate</span> being <span class="accented">round about</span> (Revised Version); or, <span class="accented">the court round about the gate</span> reached to <span class="accented">the pillars</span> (Keil); or, <span class="accented">at the pillar the court</span> was round <span class="accented">about the gate</span> (Kliefoth). The sense is, that the court lay round about the inner egress from the gate. The Authorized Version, with which Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' agrees, thinks of an inner hall between the porch of the gate and the two most western guard-chambers, round the sides of which the sixty-cubit columns stood. Ewald, following the corrupt text of the LXX., translates, "And the threshold of the outer vestibule twenty cubits, the gate court abutting on the chambers round about."

That these "windows" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, so called from being perforated) were intended to impart light to the gateway, either in whole or in part, is apparent, though it is difficult to form a clear idea of how they were situated. They were in the chambers, and in their posts and in the arches, or <span class="accented">colonnades</span> (Revised Version margin). In the chambers, or "lodges," they were most likely in the back walls, and in or near the posts, or pillars, belonging to the doors of these chambers, the clause, "and in their posts," being  regarded as epexegetic of the preceding, and designed to furnish a more precise explanation of the particular part of the guard-room in which the windows were. Similar windows existed in the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-4.htm">1 Kings 6:4</a>). The "arches," or "colonnades" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span>), were probably wall-projections on the sides of the chambers, to that light was admitted from three sides. Thus to one standing within, the whole gateway appeared studded round and round with windows. The description of the gate closes with the statement that upon each post were palm trees, which may signify either that the shaft was fashioned like a palm tree, as is sometimes seen in ancient buildings in the East (Dr. Currey, Plumptre) or that it was ornamented with representations of palm branches or palm trees (Keil, Ewald, Kliefoth). Hengstenberg's idea, that "whole palms beside the pillars are meant," is favored by Smend, who cites, in addition to ver. 26, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a>, etc., and <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, <i>there were</i> chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers <i>were</i> upon the pavement.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17-19.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">outer court</span>. Emerging from the doorway inwards, the prophet, accompanied by his celestial guide, stepped into the outward court, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the area surrounding the temple buildings. There the first thing observed was that <span class="cmt_word">chambers and a pavement</span> ran round the court. The chambers were cells, or rooms - <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> always signifying single rooms in a building (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-1.htm">Ezekiel 42:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-26.htm">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>) - whose dimensions, exact sites, and uses are not specified, though, as they were thirty in number, it is probable they were arranged on the east, north, and south sides of the court, five upon each side of the gate, and standing somewhat apart from each other; that they were large enough to contain as many as thirty persons (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>); and that they were designed for sacrificial meals and such-like purposes (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>, etc.). In pre-exilic times such halls had been occupied by distinguished person s connected with the temple service (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8-12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>, etc.; Jeremiah 36:10; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-6.htm">Ezra 10:6</a>). The pavement was a tessellated floor (comp. <a href="../../par/esther/1-6.htm">Esther 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>), which ran round the court and was named <span class="cmt_word">the lower pavement</span>, to distinguish it from that laid in the inner court which stood at a higher elevation than the outer. As another note of position, it is stated to have been by the side (literally, <span class="accented">shoulder</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the gates over against</span>  - or, <span class="accented">answerable to</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">the length of the gates</span>. This can only mean that the breadth of the pavement was fifty cubits (the length of the gates, ver. 15) less six cubits (the thickness of the wall, ver. 5), or forty-four cubits, and that it ran along the inner length of the wall on either side of the gates. The breadth of the court <span class="cmt_word">from the forefront of the lower gate</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the inner end of the east gate or the edge of the pavement, <span class="cmt_word">unto the forefront of the inner court</span> <span class="cmt_word">without was an hundred cubits</span>. Whether the measurement was up to the wall of the inner court, within which, on this hypothesis, its gate must have wholly lain, or only up to the door of the inner court, which, on this understanding, must have projected beyond its wall, is obscure. The first interpretation derives support from the circumstance that the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span> of the measurement is said to have been, not the inner gate, but the inner court; while the second finds countenance in the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span>, which seems to indicate that the measuring proceeded from the western extremity of the outer gate to the eastern extremity of the inner gate, and appears to be confirmed by vers. 23 and 27, as well as by the consideration that in this way the symmetry of the building would be better preserved than by making the outer gate project into the court and the inner gate lie wholly within the inner wall. In this way the hundred cubits marked the distance between the extremities of the gates, the whole breadth of the court being two hundred cubits, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a hundred cubits between the gates, with two gates' lengths of fifty cubits each added. The same measurements applied to the north gate, which the seer next approached. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The difference in the number of the steps was doubtless of symbolic significance, and pointed not only to the higher sanctity in general which attached to the inner court, but to the truth that, as one approached the dwelling-place of Jehovah, an increasing measure and degree of holiness were demanded - what Plumptre styles "an ever-ascending <span class="accented">sursum corda</span>." The seven steps of the outer door added to the eight steps of this amount to fifteen, with which corresponds the number of the pilgrim-psalms (<a href="../../par/psalms/120.htm">Psalm 120-134</a>.), which are supposed to have been sung, one upon each step, by the choir of Levites as they ascended first into the outer and then into the inner court. The statement that the wall-projections were towards the outer court showed that, in walking through the inner gateway, one would reverse the order of the outer gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> would first pass through the porch, then cross the threshold to the guard-rooms, next step upon the second threshold, and finally enter the inner court.

Whether such a cell stood at each of the three gates, as the plural seems to indicate, although described only in connection with the north (Keil, Kliefoth, Plumptre), or merely at one gate, and that the north - because, according to the Law (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-11.htm">Leviticus 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/6-18.htm">Leviticus 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-2.htm">Leviticus 7:2</a>), on the north side of the altar burnt, sin, and trespass offerings were to be killed (Havernick, Hengstenberg) - or the east, which is alluded to in vet, s. 39, 40 (Hitzig, Ewald, Smend), is controverted, though the former view seems the preferable, seeing that, according to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 2</a>, the priests were to prepare burnt offerings and peace offerings for the prince at the posts of the east gate.

The third quaternion of tables appears to have been planted at the steps, presumably two on' each side, i.e. if with Kliefoth, Keil, and Schroder, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> be translated "at the ascent," or "going up," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the staircase (comp. ver. 26). If, however, with the Authorized and Revised Versions, Ewald, Hengstenberg, Smend, and others, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> be read "for the burnt offering," then the exact position of the tables is left undetermined, though in any case they must have been near the slaughtering-tables. As they were designed for heavy instruments, they were constructed of hewn stones a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; from which it may be argued the eight previously mentioned were made of wood.

As this sense is unsuitable, recourse must be had to its derivation (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, "to put, set, or fix"), which suggests as its import here either, as Ewald, Kliefoth, Hengstenberg, Havernick, and Smend, following the LXX. and Vulgate, prefer, "ledges," or "border guards," on the edge of the tables, to keep the instruments or flesh from falling off; or, as Kimchi, Gesenius, Furst, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre, after the Chaldean paraphrast, explain, "pegs" fastened in the wall for hanging the slaughtered caresses before they were flayed. In favor of the first meaning stand the facts that the second clause of this verse speaks of" tables," not of "walls," and that the measure of the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> is one of breadth rather than of length; against it are the considerations that the dual form, <span class="accented">shephataim</span>, fits better to a forked peg than to a double border, and that the <span class="accented">shephataim</span> are stated to have been fastened "in the house" (<span class="accented">ba-baith</span>), which again suits the idea of a peg fastened in the outer wall of the porch, rather than of a border fixed upon a table. The last clause of this verse is rendered by Ewald, after the LXX., "and over the tables" (obviously those standing outside of the porch) "were covers to protect them from rain and from drought;" and it is conceivable that coverings might have been advantageous for both the wooden tables and the officiating priests; only the Hebrew must be changed before it can yield this rendering. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a></div><div class="verse">And without the inner gate <i>were</i> the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which <i>was</i> at the side of the north gate; and their prospect <i>was</i> toward the south: one at the side of the east gate <i>having</i> the prospect toward the north.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 44-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">chambers of the ringers</span> According to ver. 44, these, of which the number is not recorded, were situated in the inner court, outside of the inner gate, at the side of the north gate, and looked towards the south, one only being located at the side of the east gate with a prospect towards the north. Interpreted in this way, they cannot have been the same as the "priests' chambers" mentioned in vers. 45, 46, though these also looked in the same direction. The language, however, seems to indicate that they were the same, and on this hypothesis it is difficult to understand how they should be called "the chambers of the singers," and at the same time be assigned to the priests, "the keepers of the charge of the house" and "the keepers of the charge of the altar." Hengstenberg. Kliefoth, Schroder, and others hold that Ezekiel purposed to suggest that in the vision-temple before him the choral service was no longer to be left exclusively in the hands of the Levites as it had been in the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33-47</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-19.htm">2 Chronicles 20:19</a>), but that the priests were to participate therein. Dr. Currey imagines the chambers may have been occupied in common by the singers and the priests when engaged on duty at the temple. The LXX. text reads, "And he led me unto the inner court, and behold two chambers in the inner court, one at the back of the gate which looks towards the north, and bearing towards the south, and one at the back of the gate which looks towards the south, and bearing towards the north;" and in accordance with this Rosenm&uuml;ller, Hitzig, Ewald, Keil, and Smend propose sundry emendations on the Hebrew text. Since, however, it cannot be certified that the LXX. did not paraphrase or mistranslate the present rather than follow a different text, it is safer to abide by the renderings of the Authorized and Revised Versions. Yet one cannot help feeling that the LXX. translation has the merit of clearness and simplicity.

Hence the priests alluded to by Ezekiel as the keepers of the charge of the house were most likely those who superintended the Levites in the execution of their tasks.

The distance from north to south of the inner court being a hundred cubits, if to these be added twice two hundred cubits, the space between the outer court wall and that of the inner court, the result will give five hundred cubits as the breadth of the outer court, from north gate to south gate. Then as the length of the inner court was a hundred cubits, if to these be added first the hundred cubits lying before the inner court towards the east, secondly, the hundred cubits covered by the temple (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), and thirdly, the one hundred cubits which extended behind the temple (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13, 14</a>), the total will amount to five hundred cubits for the length of the outer court from east to west. The outer court, therefore, like the inner, was a square.

The measurements in ver. 49 of the length of the porch (from east to west) twenty cubits, and the breadth (from north to south) eleven cubits, he harmonizes with this view by assuming that the pillars, which were five cubits bread in front, were only half that breadth in the inside, the side wall dividing it in two, so that, although to one entering the opening was only six cubits, the moment one stood in the interior it was 6 cubits + 2 &times; 2.5 cubits   =   11 cubits. Kliefoth, however, rejects this explanation, and understands the three cubits to refer to the portion of the entrance on either side which was closed by a gate, perhaps of lattice-work, leaving for the ingress and egress of priests a passage of five cubits. In this view the whole front of the porch would he 5 cubits of passage + 6 (2 &times; 3) cubits of lattice-work + 10 (2 &times; 5) cubits of pillar, equal in all to 21 cubits. Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' includes the three cubits of door in the five cubits of post, and, supposing the temple entrance to be ten cubits, makes the whole front to have been twenty cubits. We prefer Kliefoth's opinion.

It is sufficient to understand the phrase as signifying that the measurements noted had a special relation to the entire breadth of the temple, here styled "tabernacle," or "tent," to indicate the covered portion of the edifice, which, in this respect, and in respect of its being the place of meeting between Jehovah and Israel, resembled the ancient sanctuary of the wilderness.

Kliefoth and Keil take the six as the height and the seven as the breadth of the entrance into the holy of holies; but as no other measurement of height occurs throughout this description, Dr. Currey regards "six" as the distance from "pest" to "post," and "seven" as the actual width of the door, each post projecting half a cubit beyond the hinge of the door, which opened inward. Ewald and Villalpandus, after the LXX., read, "the entrance six cubits and the flanks of the entrance seven cubits;" and these figures, 7 + 6 4- 7, certainly make up the breadth of the interior; only it is impossible to extract this meaning from the Hebrew without tampering with the text.

It is not needful to alter the text, as Bottcher, Hitzig, Havernick, and Ewald propose to do, in order to make it read, with the LXX., "chamber against chamber, thirty and (this) three times," on the ground that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> and not <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is the preposition, because in Ezekiel <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> often stands for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). How the chambers were arranged along the three sides is not stated; but most likely there were twelve threes on each of the longer sides, the north and the south, and six threes on the shorter or western side. Like the chambers in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-6.htm">1 Kings 6:6</a>). those in Ezekiel's were not fastened to "the wall of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the temple proper; the only question is whether they were built against the temple wall, as Kliefoth, Keil, Smend, and Schroder suppose, or, as Ewald and Dr. Currey seem to think, against another wall, five cubits thick (ver. 9), which ran parallel to the temple wall, and which, having been built expressly for the support of the side chambers, might properly enough be said to be "of the house," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> belonging to it. In the former case the chambers would doubtless be fastened to the temple wall by means of "ledges," "holds," "rebates," as in the temple of Solomon: in the latter case, as Ewald translates, there would be "a light passage between the wall of the house and the side chambers around." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-7.htm">Ezekiel 41:7</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>there was</i> an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house <i>was still</i> upward, and so increased <i>from</i> the lowest <i>chamber</i> to the highest by the midst.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - In the side chambers <span class="cmt_word">an enlarging</span> took place as they went up, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the floorage of the second story exceeded that of the first, and the floorage of the third that of the second; though how this was effected can only be conjectured. If the chambers were built against the temple wall, then probably the wall at each story went in, say a cubit or a cubit and a half from the outside, so as to admit the beams; or, if the chambers were built against an outside wall, a similar recession of the wall from the inside may have taken place. In either ease, <span class="cmt_word">the</span> (interior) <span class="cmt_word">breadth of the house</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the side chambers, would be <span class="cmt_word">upward</span>, and would increase from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst. Plumptre, after Kliefoth, suggests that the increasing size of the chambers in the three stories may have been due to projecting galleries. Ewald, taking "house" as "the temple," supposes that it gradually became bigger. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> broader, as it rose, which could be the case only if the side chambers were built against the temple wall, and the increased width of the stories was scoured By projecting galleries or corridors. Greater obscurity attaches to the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">and a winding about still upward to the side chambers</span>, which the Authorized Version and some expositors regard as an indication that Ezekiel's temple had a spiral staircase like that in Solomon's temple (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-8.htm">1 Kings 6:8</a>); and probably some such mode of passing from story to story did exist in Ezekiel's temple; yet the clause, when properly rendered, does not refer to this. The Revised Version reads, "And the side chambers were broader as they encompassed <span class="accented">the house</span> higher and higher; for the encompassing of the house went higher and higher round about the house; therefore the breadth of the house <span class="accented">continued</span> upward; and so one went up (most likely by a spiral stair) from the lowest chamber to the highest by the middle chamber." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a></div><div class="verse">I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers <i>were</i> a full reed of six great cubits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8</span> explains that "the house" did not stand upon the level ground, but, like many temple buildings in antiquity (see Schurer, in Riehm's 'Handworterbuch,' art.

In consequence of this, the foundations of the side chambers were <span class="cmt_word">a</span> <span class="cmt_word">full reed of six great cubits</span>; or, <span class="accented">of six cubits to the joining</span> (Revised Version); "six cubits to the story" (Ewald); literally, <span class="accented">six cubits to the armpit</span>. This can hardly mean six cubits each equal to the distance from the elbow to the wrist, which would be a new definition of the length of the reed; but as Havernick and Kliefoth propose, must be taken as an architectural term indicative of the point where one portion of the building joined on to another. Accordingly, by most interpreters the six cubits are considered to be a statement of the height of the ceiling above the floor in each story, which would give an elevation of eighteen cubits for the three stories; but probably they mark only the height of the temple and side chamber basis above the ground. Kliefoth includes both views, and obtains an altitude of twenty-four cubits from the ground to the temple roof.

Accepting these measurements, Kliefoth and Keil regard the free space as a walk of five cubits broad on the outside of the side chambers. Ewald, and Dr. Currey, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' place the five cubits between the temple wall and the side chambers.

Plumptre, commenting on this, writes, "Possibly Ezekiel shared the feelings of Daniel (Daniel 9:25), that the rebuilding would be 'in troublous times,' and did not contemplate an abundance of gold as likely to be the outcome of the scant offerings of an impoverished people." The dimensions of this altar in the tabernacle were two cubits high and one cubit long and broad; in the Solomonic temple, though not stated, they were probably the same as in the tabernacle; in Ezekiel's temple they were three cubits high, two cubits long (and probably two cubits broad). <span class="cmt_word">The corners of the altar</span> were most likely "the horns, or horn-shaped points projecting at the cornets." <span class="cmt_word">The length.</span> Ewald, Keil, Smend, and others, after the LXX., change into "base," "stand," or "pedestal," on the  ground that the length has been already mentioned, and that one does not usually speak of a length being of wood; but it does not strike one as peculiarly objectionable to say that the altar had corner pieces, a length, and walls (or sides) of wood, meaning thereby to intimate that it was wholly constructed of timber. When the prophet's attention had been directed to it, the guide <span class="accented">who</span> accompanied him observed, <span class="cmt_word">This is the table that is before the Lord</span>, not because, as Bottcher conjectured, the altar was regarded as including the table of showbread, but because in the Law the offerings laid upon the altar had been spoken of as the bread of God (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 8, 17, 21, 22</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7</a>); and because in this vision table and altar appear to be used inter-changeably (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-16.htm">Ezekiel 44:16</a>).

The last verse states that narrow or closed (as in ver. 16) windows admitted light into the porch, while carvings of palm trees adorned its walls on each side. The cherubic figures, Plumptre hints, were absent, because the porch was a place of less sanctity than the temple. Hengstenberg notes that the words, "thick planks," "thick beams," or "steps," as he translates, fitly close this description, "as placing the extreme east over against the extreme west with which it began." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

Those in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-44.htm">Ezekiel 40:44</a> were in the inner, while these were in the outer; and if the cells spoken of in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a> were in the outer court, they were also on the pavement by the outer wall, while the chambers now alluded to were "over against," or <span class="accented">in front of</span>, the gizrah, or separate place (see on Ezekiel 41:12), and "over against," or in <span class="accented">front of</span>, "the building toward the north." This building Kiel, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre hold to have been the erection on the gizrah; Ewald, Kliefoth, Smend, and Currey believe it to have meant the temple. The question as to which view is correct is immaterial, since the row of chambers extended in front of parts of both buildings. Ewald, as usual, follows the LXX., and translates, "brought me to the fifteen (another Greek text has five) cells;" but of this the Hebrew contains nothing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-2.htm">Ezekiel 42:2</a></div><div class="verse">Before the length of an hundred cubits <i>was</i> the north door, and the breadth <i>was</i> fifty cubits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - With this verse the Authorized and Revised Versions begin a new sentence, and are in this at one with Smend; but the majority of expositors place the second verse under the regimen of the verb, "he brought me," in ver. 1, and understand the seer to state that he was planted down <span class="cmt_word">before the length</span> (or, long side) <span class="cmt_word">of an hundred cubits</span>, <span class="accented">with the door toward the north</span>, <span class="accented">and the breadth fifty</span> cubits. That is to say, the building which contained the sacristies, or priests' chambers, was a hundred cubits long and fifty bread. As the building on the separate place was also a hundred cubits long (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13</a>), it might seem as if this erection ran exactly parallel to that, and this view is taken by Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Plumptre; but Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, on the authority of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>, locate a priests' kitchen behind the priests' chambers towards the west, and reserve for it forty cubits, on the plausible ground that it would not likely be smaller in size than the sacrificial kitchen for the people (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-22.htm">Ezekiel 46:22</a>). Hence, if the building under consideration began forty cubits east of the gizrah wall, it would extend twenty cubits over the end and along the length of the temple. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-3.htm">Ezekiel 42:3</a></div><div class="verse">Over against the twenty <i>cubits</i> which <i>were</i> for the inner court, and over against the pavement which <i>was</i> for the utter court, <i>was</i> gallery against gallery in three <i>stories</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - Considerable difficulty attaches to the words of this verse. <span class="cmt_word">The twenty cubits which were for the inner court</span> (better, <span class="accented">the twenty which belonged to the inner court</span>) have been taken by Kliefoth to signify the watchers' coils in the inner court, west of the north door (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a>), and by Plumptre to indicate an inner area of twenty cubits square, round which the galleries in three stories ran. Both of these views, however, have this against them, that they are purely conjectural, the text in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-40.htm">Ezekiel 40:40-46</a> saying nothing about twenty cubits in connection with the priests' chambers, and the text under review making no suggestion of an inner area of twenty cubits, but only of the already well-known "inner court." Hence the opinion of Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, and Currey has most in its favor, that the "twenty" alongside of which the chamber now alluded to lay, meant the twenty cubits clear space which surrounded the temple on the south, west, and north sides (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12-14</a>), and which could properly be spoken of as "for the inner court," rather as "belonging to the inner court," since it was practically a continuation of the same. <span class="cmt_word">The pavement which was for</span> (or, <span class="accented">belonged to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the outer court</span>, was manifestly that already described as running along the inside of the outer wall (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17</a>). If, as is likely, this pavement was continued along the north side of the inner court wall, then the priests' chambers must have stood upon it, and been over against it on the east side, as Currey explains; but the easier and more natural supposition is that adopted by Keil, that the second "over against" points to that which faced the chambers on the north, viz. the pavement, as the first marked their boundary on the south. <span class="cmt_word">Gallery against gallery</span> (see on Ezekiel 41:15). In three stories; or, in the third story (Revised Version). Whether these galleries existed in each of three stories of the building, or only in the third, cannot be determined.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-4.htm">Ezekiel 42:4</a></div><div class="verse">And before the chambers <i>was</i> a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before the chambers a walk</span>.

The LXX. identifies the two, and understands a way in front of the chambers of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long. Ewald and Keil so far agree with the LXX. as to change the one cubit way into a hundred-cubit way; but whereas Ewald thinks of a passage ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long, running from west to east between two sets of chambers, Keil speaks of a <span class="accented">walk</span> of ten cubits broad and a hundred cubits long in front of the cells, extending into a way of equal breadth and length, leading westward into the inner court. Havernick's, Hengstenberg's, and Kliefoth's idea, favored by Schroder, and probably the best, is that of a walk of ten cubits in front of the cells, and a <span class="accented">way</span> of one cubit leading into them from the walk. Dr. Currey reverses this, and makes a walk of ten cubits leading inward, and a <span class="accented">way</span>, or kerb, of one cubit in front. Plumptre agrees that the passage leading into the chambers was ten cubits broad, but regards the one cubit as denoting the thickness of the wall separating the <span class="accented">walk</span> from the interior of the chambers.

That this fence was on the east side is rendered probable by the circumstance that the sacrificial kitchen lay upon the west (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19, 20</a>), and by the statements which follow in vers. 8 and 9. The fence was doubtless intended to screen the side windows of the lower chambers from public gaze, since these were to be occupied as robing and disrobing rooms for the priests who should officiate in the temple (see ver. 14; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-19.htm">Ezekiel 44:19</a>).

The only question among interpreters is whether ver. 10 relates to the north or south suite, or to an east suite. Schroder and Currey see in ver. 10 a repetition, from another point of view, of what has already been stated about the north chambers, viz. that, viewed from the outer court, they appeared in the thickness or breadth of the wall (ver. 7) and (lengthwise) over against the separate place and the buildings, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the gizrah and the temple. Ewald, Smend, and Keil decide that ver. 10 forms part of the description of a south set of chambers only; but in order to make this good they alter the text by substituting <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the south," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "the east." Plumptre agrees with Kliefoth and Hengstenberg in holding that two similar sets of chambers are described, one on the east side and one on the south side of the inner court wall. The principal objection to this is the fact that only two suites, the north and the south, are referred to by the guide in vers. 13 and 14.

The obvious intention of this was to convey an idea of the special sanctity of the worship in which the priests were engaged; and just for this reason also they were required to array themselves in <span class="cmt_word">other garments</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-23.htm">Leviticus 16:23</a>) when they entered on their priestly functions.

The statement that <span class="cmt_word">the earth shined with his glory</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/18-1.htm">Revelation 18:1</a>) has by Havernick, Kliefoth, and others been supposed to indicate the absence of that "cloud" in which the glory of Jehovah appeared in both the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34, 35</a>) and the Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10, 11</a>), and thereby to point to the clearer and more resplendent manifestations of the Godhead, which were to be given in connection with the new dispensation for which Ezekiel's "house" was being prepared. This, however, as Keil has shown, cannot be main-rained in face of the facts that in both Exodus and 1 Kings "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord"</span> is used synonymously with "the cloud," and that in Ezekiel's vision "the glory" and "the cloud" were alike present (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-3.htm">Ezekiel 10:3, 4</a>). Kliefoth and Schroder hold "the earth" which was illumined to have been "the whole globe," "the entire region of humanity," as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-1.htm">Isaiah 60:1</a>, etc.; but there does not appear ground for departing from the ordinary sense of the words, that "the path" of the advancing God was irradiated by the brilliance of his material glory.

Ewald and Smend follow the Vulgate. <span class="accented">quando venit ut disperderet</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> substituting "he," Jehovah, for "I," Ezekiel; but the change is unnecessary, as the prophet's language is perfectly intelligible and quite correct, since "the prophet destroyed the city ideally by his prophecy" (Hitzig), and it is not unusual for Scripture to represent a prophet as himself doing what he is only sent to predict (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>). The prophet's reason for introducing this clause was manifestly the same he had for identifying the visions - to show that, while it was the same Jehovah who had departed from the old temple that was now returning to the new, there was nothing incongruous in the idea that he who in the past had shown himself a God of justice and judgment by overturning and destroying the old, should in the future exhibit himself as a God of grace and mercy by condescending to establish his abode in the new. The impression produced upon the prophet's soul by his vision was the same that had been produced by the <span class="accented">former - he fell upon his face</span> in awe and wonder.

Two questions arise - Who was the speaker? and, Who the man? As <span class="accented">to the speaker</span>, the natural reply is that the One who addressed Ezekiel from the interior of the "house" was Jehovah himself, whose "glory" had just entered in to take possession of the house, and this view is adopted by most interpreters, though Hengstenberg and Schroder regard the man who stood beside the prophet as the one who addressed him. As to <span class="accented">the man</span>, it cannot, as Kliefoth maintains, be decided solely by the absence of the article before "man" that this was a different person from the guide who had hitherto conducted the prophet and measured the Building. The article may have Been emitted because the important point to be recorded was not the circumstance that the "one" who stood beside him was his quondam guide, but the fact that this "one" was a man. That he was also Ezekiel's old conductor is at least a natural suggestion when one finds him afterwards appearing as a measurer with a line in his hand (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-3.htm">Ezekiel 47:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, <i>neither</i> they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-12.</span> - Debate exists as to who the speaker in the seventh verse was, whether Jehovah or the man - some holding with Kliefoth, Ewald, Smend, and Currey, that he was Jehovah; others, with Havernick, Keil, Hengstenberg, and Schroder, that he was "the man;" and still others, with Plumptre, that it cannot be decided which he was. One thing is clear, that if "the man" was the speaker, his words and message were not his own, but Jehovah's. Yet unless the man had been the angel of the Lord - the view of Hengstenberg and Schroder - it will always seem incongruous that he should have addressed Ezekiel without a "Thus saith the Lord." Hence the notion that the speaker was Jehovah is, perhaps, the one freest from difficulty. The message announced or communication made to the prophet related first to Jehovah's purpose in entering the temple (vers. 7-9), and secondly to his object in showing the house to the prophet, viz. that he might show it to the house of Israel (vers. 10-12). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - The LXX. and the Vulgate divide the present verse into two parts, and take the first as equivalent to a solemn word of consecration, the former supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> the latter <span class="accented">vidisti</span>, "thou hast seen." The Chaldee Targum inserts, <span class="accented">hic est locus</span>, "this is the place," and in so doing is followed by Luther and the Revised Version. Some word, it is obvious, either a "see!" or a "behold!" must be interpolated, in thought at least, unless one adopts the construction of the Authorized Version, with which Smend agrees, and makes "the place of my throne," etc., to be governed By the verb "defile," or, with Ewald, places it under the regimen of "show" in ver. 10, throwing the whole intervening clause into a long parenthesis  - a device which does not contribute to lucidity. Of the two expressions here employed to designate the sanctuary - not the temple proper, but the whole house with its surroundings - the former, <span class="cmt_word">the place of my throne</span>, though peculiar to Ezekiel, receives explanation from the conception, familiar to earlier writers, of Jehovah as dwelling between the cherubim (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>); the latter, <span class="cmt_word">the place of the soles of my feet</span>, was of frequent occurrence to denote the ark of the covenant (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>) and the temple (<a href="../../par/isaiah/60-13.htm">Isaiah 60:13</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-1.htm">Lamentations 2:1</a>). The word of consecration was expressed in the promise, <span class="cmt_word">I will dwell</span> (in the temple) <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the children of Israel forever,</span> etc., which went beyond anything that had been spoken concerning either the tabernacle of Moses or the <span class="accented">temple</span> of Solomon (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-13.htm">1 Kings 6:13</a>). The second part of the verse announces what would be the result of Jehovah's perpetual inhabitation of the temple - the house of Israel would no more defile his holy Name either <span class="cmt_word">by their whoredom or by the carcasses of their kings in their high places</span>, or, according to another reading, <span class="accented">in their death</span>. That the whoredom signified idolatry (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>.) commentators are agreed. What divides them is whether this also is alluded to in the alternative clause. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Keil, Fairbairn, and Plumptre believe it is, contending that the "carcasses of their kings" (comp. Leviticus  26:30; and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-18.htm">Jeremiah 16:18</a>) was a contemptuous and satirical designation of the idols they had formerly served, that the word "kings ' is frequently employed in this sense in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-21.htm">Isaiah 8:21</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>), and that the special sin complained of, that of building altars for dead idols in the very temple court, had been practiced by more kings than one in Judah (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4, 5-7</a>); and in support of this view may be urged first that it is favored by the use of the term <span class="accented">bamotk</span>, or "<span class="accented">high</span> <span class="accented">places</span>," in ver. 7, and secondly by the exposition offered in ver. 8 of the nature of the sin. Ewald, Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Smend, on the other hand, regard the sin spoken of in the second clause as different from that indicated in the first, maintaining that while this was the practice of defiling Jehovah's sanctuary by idolatry that was the desecration of the same by the interment in its courts of their dead kings. Against this, however, stands the fact that no authentic instance can be produced of a Judaean sovereign's corpse having been interred in the temple area. David, Solomon, Jehoshaphat, and others were buried in the city of David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-50.htm">1 Kings 22:50</a>), and a place of sepulchers existed on the south-west comer of Zion in the days of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a>); but these prove nothing unless the temple hill be taken, as no doubt it sometimes was, in an extended sense as inclusive of Mount Zion. Similarly, the statement that Manasseh had a burial-place in the garden of Uzzah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18, 26</a>) cannot be adduced in support of this view, unless it can be shown that the garden of Uzzah was situated on the temple hill. On the whole, therefore, the balance of argument inclines in favor of the first view, though it does involve the introduction of a figurative sense into the words.

Ezekiel's theology in this respect harmonizes with that of Old and New Testament writers generally, who invariably postulate purity of heart and life as a necessary condition of God's abiding in the heart, while asserting that such Divine indwelling in the heart is the only certain creator of such purity (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-12.htm">Isaiah 26:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).

This explained how, by beholding the house, Israel would be led to repent, and be ashamed of her iniquities. There is no ground for thinking the ultimate object Jehovah had in view, in recommending the house of Israel to note the proportions of the visionary edifice, was, as Wellhausen, Smend, and others allege, that they might reproduce these in the post-exilic building; if they were to measure, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> scan and meditate upon the fair dimensions of the "house," it was that they might understand its religious or moral and spiritual significance, both as a whole and in detail.

In this instance "the house" must not be restricted to the temple proper, consisting of the holy place and the holy of holies, but extended to the whole free space encompassing the outer court, the quadrangular area of three thousand cubits square (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>); and concerning this house as so defined, the fundamental torah, law, or regulation, is declared to be that of its complete sanctity. Ewald and Smend, as usual, unite with the LXX. in connecting "upon the top of the mountain" with "house;" but expositors generally agree that the clause belong to the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">Upon the top of the mountain the whole limit thereof round about;</span> and that the prophet's thought is that the entire territory upon the mountain summit included within the above specified border, and not merely the inner sanctuary, or even that with its chambers and courts, was to be regarded as most holy, or as a <span class="accented">holy of holies</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was to be consecrated as the innermost <span class="accented">adytum</span> of the tabernacle and temple had been. by the indwelling of Jehovah.

Its dimensions, then omitted, are now reported in connection with its consecration, which also is narrated as a pendant to that of the "house," because of the intimate connection between the two - the consecration of the altar being practically equivalent to the consecration of the house, and the consecration of the house finding approximate expression in the consecration of the altar. As in the other portions of the temple, so in this, the measurements are given <span class="cmt_word">after the cubits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by or in cubits, the length of each cubit being noted at "a cubit and an hand-breadth," as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>.  They are likewise taken first from the foundation upwards (vers. 13-15), and then from the top downwards (vers. 16, 17).

If Smend's feasible notion be not adopted, then probably that of Hitzig, Kliefoth, or Keil most nearly expresses the conception of the Hebrew term. The altar was surrounded by an enclosure in which it seemed to be set, or out of which to rise; the dimensions of this "stand" or "enclosure" being a cubit in height, and a cubit in breadth, with <span class="cmt_word">a border</span> on its edge round about a span or half a cubit high.

(<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>), identify as synonymous, and translate by "hearth." But the first can only signify "the mount of God," while the latter may mean either "lion of God" or "hearth of God." Kliefoth, deriving the latter from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to consume," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;</span>, "a ram," prefers as its import "ram-devourer;" Hengstenberg, resolving into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> "a ram," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;</span>, "a lion," proposes as its equivalent "ram-lion." <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "the lion that consumes the rams for God" - a ten-doting closely allied to that of Kliefoth. In any case, the terms allude to parts of the altar: the second, Ariel (equivalent to the hearth on which God's fire burns), according to Keil, Kliefoth, and the best expositors, meaning the flat surface of the altar; and the first, Harel (conveying the ideas of elevation and sanctity), the base on which it rested. The height of this base was four cubits, while from the hearth projected four horns, as in the altars of the Mosaic tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-2.htm">Exodus 27:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-2.htm">Exodus 38:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-15.htm">Leviticus 8:15</a>) and Solomonic temple (<a href="../../par/psalms/118-27.htm">Psalm 118:27</a>). If the length of these be set down, as Kliefoth suggests, at three cubits, then the whole height of the altar will be in cubits - one for the ground bottom, two for the lower settle, four for the upper, four for the bases of the hearth, with three for the horns, equal to fourteen in all; or, omitting the horns, of which the length is not given, and the altar base, which is distinguished from the altar, ten cubits in all for the altar proper. As to the symbolic import of the "horns," Kurtz, after Hofmaun and Kliefoth, finds this in the idea of elevation, the "horns," as the highest point in the altar, bringing the blood put upon them nearer to God than the sides did the blood sprinkled on them (see 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 13); Keil, after Bahr, in the notions of strength, beauty, and blessing, the horns of an animal being the points in which its power, grace, and fullness of life are concentrated, and therefore fitting emblems of those points in the altar in which appears "its significance as a place of the revelation of Divine might and strength, of Divine salvation and blessing" ('Biblische Archaologie,' &sect; 20). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-16.htm">Ezekiel 43:16</a></div><div class="verse">And the altar <i>shall be</i> twelve <i>cubits</i> long, twelve broad, square in the four squares thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - The measurements that now begin concern the breadth of <span class="cmt_word">the altar</span>, and proceed from above downwards. First the altar, or, <span class="accented">hearth of God</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ariel</span>) was <span class="cmt_word">twelve cubits long and twelve broad</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> was square in the four squares (or, sides) thereof, or a perfect square (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-16.htm">Revelation 21:16</a>). Next the <span class="cmt_word">settle</span>, or, <span class="accented">enclosure</span> (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) of ver. 14, was <span class="cmt_word">fourteen</span> cubits long, and <span class="cmt_word">fourteen broad in the four squares</span> (or, sides) <span class="cmt_word">thereof</span>; the fourteen being made up of the twelve cubits of the altar-hearth's side with one cubit of ledge from the settle all round. The only question is to which "settle," the upper or the under, reference is made. Some expositors, identifying the greater Azarah with the Harel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "upper settle," with "the mount of God" or the base of the hearth, make the altar height only seven cubits from the ground to the hearth. The general belief, however, is that they cannot be so identified. Among interpreters who distinguish them, Kliefoth, with whom Smend agrees, holds the "settle" in this verse to be the <span class="accented">harel</span>, or "mount of God," which extended (Smend says with a <span class="accented">hek</span>. or "gutter") one cubit on each side beyond the <span class="accented">ariel</span>, or "hearth of God," so that the "mount of God," on which the" hearth of God" rested, was fourteen cubits square. Then, assuming a similar extension of one cubit at each stage - in the greater azarah, the lesser azarah, and the hek, or ground bottom - he finds the surface of the greater azarah to be sixteen, of the lesser azarah eighteen, and of the ground bottom twenty cubits square. Keil, with whom Schroder and Currey agree, objects to this as involving too much of arbitrary assumption, and takes the" settle" of this verse to mean the lower azarah; so that no additional measurements are required beyond those given in the text. If the square surface of the greater azarah be considered as having been the same as that of the harel, so that their sides were continuous, then, as the "ground bottom" extended one cubit on each side beyond the lower azarsh, the altar at its base was a square of sixteen cubits. Comparing now these measurements with those of the altar of burnt offering in the tabernacle and the temple, one finds that the former was only five cubits square and three cubits high (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1</a>), while the latter was twenty cubits broad, but only ten cubits high (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>), which awakes the suspicion that the different views above noted have been insensibly influenced by a desire on the part of their authors to make them harmonize with the measurements of the temple. But there does not appear sufficient reason why the measurements of Ezekiel's altar should have agreed with those of Solomon's rather than with those of Moses', <span class="cmt_word">The border</span> (or, <span class="accented">parapet</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of half a cubit</span> which ran round the ledge, or bottom, of a cubit, at the foot of the lower azarah was clearly designed, not for the protection of the priest officiating, but for ornament. The <span class="cmt_word">stairs</span> (or, <span class="accented">steps</span>), mention of which closes the description, mark a departure, not from the pattern of the Solomonic temple, in which the altar must have had steps (see Keil's 'Biblische Archaologie,' p. 141), but from the pattern of the tabernacle, in which altar-steps were disallowed (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a>) and did not exist (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>). But if, as Jewish tradition asserts, the pest-exilic altar had no steps as Ezekiel's had, having been reached by an inclined plane, because in the so-called book of the covenant steps were forbidden, how does this harmonize with the theory that Ezekiel's vision temple was designed as a model for the post-exilic temple? And why, if the priest-code was the composition of a writer who worked in the spirit and on the lines of Ezekiel, should it have omitted to assign steps to the tabernacle altar?

As the altar in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-1.htm">Exodus 29:1-46</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-11.htm">Leviticus 8:11-33</a>), and that in Solomon's temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63-66</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-4.htm">2 Chronicles 7:4-10</a>), so was this in Ezekiel's "house" dedicated by a special ceremonial before being brought into ordinary use. The particular ritual observed by Solomon is not described in detail; but a comparison between that enjoined upon and practiced by Moses with that revealed to and published by Ezekiel shows that while in some respects they agreed, in other important particulars they differed. In both the ceremony largely consisted in offering sacrifice and smearing blood, and lasted seven days; but in the former the ceremony was performed exclusively by Moses, consisted, in addition to the above, of an anointing of the altar, the holy utensils, and the tabernacle itself with oil, and was associated with the consecration of the priests; whereas in the latter, in addition to some variations in the sacrificial victims, which will be noted in the course of exposition, the priests should bear an active part - there should be no anointing with oil, and no consecration of the priests, the priesthood being assumed as already existing. If in Ezekiel's ritual there was no mention of a cleansing of the sanctuary (that of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a> referring to a special ease), but only of the altar, that was sufficiently explained by the circumstance that Jehovah was already in the "house." The final clause, to <span class="cmt_word">offer burnt offerings thereon</span>, <span class="cmt_word">and to sprinkle blood thereon</span>, indicates the purpose for which the altar was to be used.

This injunction, which was addressed to Ezekiel, not as the representative of the people or of the priests (Smend), but as the prophet of Jehovah, made it clear that Ezekiel was not to act in the future consecration of the altar alone as Moses did in the dedication of the tabernacle altar, but that the priests were to bear their part in the ceremonial. If some expressions, as the use of "thou" in this and the following verses, appear to suggest that Ezekiel alone should officiate, the employment of "they" in vers. 22, 24, 25, 26 as plainly indicates that Ezekiel's share in the ceremonial was to be performed through the medium of the priests. And, indeed, if the temple was a pattern designed to be converted into an actual building after the return from captivity, as the newer criticism contends, it is apparent that Ezekiel could not have been expected to have any hand in its erection. <span class="cmt_word">The Levites that be of the seed of Zadok</span>.

In the present instance the blood was to be carefully put upon <span class="cmt_word">the four horns</span> of the altar - the only part to be smeared with blood in the Mosaic  consecration (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the four corners of the settle</span>, or azarah, but whether the greater or lesser is left undecided, though in all probability it was the under, if not both, and <span class="cmt_word">the border round about</span>, that mentioned in ver. 17; and the effect of this smearing with blood should be to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse and purge</span>, or, <span class="accented">make atonement</span> for, the altar; not for the people, as Havernick interprets, saying, "without an atoned-for altar, no atoned-for people (<span class="accented">ohne entsuhnten Altar</span>, <span class="accented">kein entsuhntes Volk</span>)," but for the altar, either, as Kliefoth suggests, because, being made out of a part of the sinful earth and world, it required to be sanctified, or because, as Plumptre prefers, the sins of the people having been, as it were, transferred to it, it stood in need of cleansing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-21.htm">Ezekiel 43:21</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - As a further stage in the ceremony, the Bullock of the sin offering, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the carcass of the victim, was to be burned by Ezekiel or the priest acting for him in <span class="cmt_word">the appointed place of the house, without the sanctuary</span>, as in the Mosaic code it was prescribed that the flesh of the bullock, with his skin and dung, should be burned without the camp (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-12.htm">Leviticus 4:12, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-11.htm">Leviticus 9:11, 15</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>). Ewald at first sought the place here referred to in the sacrificial kitchens (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-19.htm">Ezekiel 46:19</a>), which it could not be, as these belonged to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense; he has, however, since adopted the view of Kliefoth, which is doubtless correct, that the "place of the house, without the sanctuary" meant the <span class="accented">gizrah</span>, or separate place (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-12.htm">Ezekiel 41:12</a>), which was a part of the "house" in the widest sense, and yet belonged not to the "sanctuary" in the strictest sense. Smend thinks of the <span class="accented">migrash</span>, "suburbs" or "open spaces," which surrounded the temple precincts (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>); and these were certainly without the sanctuary, while they were also appointed for the holy place, and might have been designated, as here, <span class="accented">miphkadh</span>, as being always under the inspection of the temple watchmen. The fact that in post-exilic times one of the city gates was called <span class="accented">Hammiphkadh</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a>) lends countenance to this view. That in this "appointed place" the carcass of the bullock should be consumed was a deviation from the Mosaic ritual, which prescribed that the fat portions should be burned upon the altar, and the rest eaten as a sacrificial meal (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-10.htm">Leviticus 4:10, 26, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>, 81; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7, 17, 18</a>). Keil appears to think that the fat portions may have been burned upon the altar, although it is not so mentioned, and that only "those points" were mentioned "in which deviations from the ordinary ritual took place." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-22.htm">Ezekiel 43:22</a></div><div class="verse">And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they did cleanse <i>it</i> with the bullock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - The second day's ceremonial should begin with the offering of <span class="cmt_word">a kid of the goats</span> (rather, a <span class="accented">he-goat</span>) <span class="cmt_word">without blemish for a sin offering</span>, the ritual observed being probably the same as that of the preceding day. The substitution of a "he-goat," the offering for a ruler who sins (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23, 24</a>), instead of a "young bullock," which formed the first day's offering, was a deviation from the ritual prescribed for the consecration of the Mosaic altar and priesthood (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>). The object of the offering of the "he-goat" was the same as that of the offering of the "bullock," viz. <span class="cmt_word">to cleanse the altar</span>; not, however, as if the previous day's cleansing had been insufficient and required to be supplemented, or had already become inefficient so as to call for renewal, but in the sense of recalling the meaning and impression of the previous day's ceremonial, and so in a manner linking it on with the several rites of the succeeding days. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-23.htm">Ezekiel 43:23</a></div><div class="verse">When thou hast made an end of cleansing <i>it</i>, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - The presentation of <span class="cmt_word">a burnt offering unto the Lord</span> was the next item in the ritual that should be observed. The material composing it should consist of <span class="cmt_word">a young bullock without blemish</span>, as in the ordinary sacrificial cede (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3, 4, 5</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and a ram out of the flock without blemish</span>, as in the consecration of the priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>) and of the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/8-18.htm">Leviticus 8:18</a>). The persons presenting it should be the prophet, <span class="cmt_word">thou</span>, and the priests, <span class="cmt_word">they</span>, as his representatives. The mode of offering should be by burning, the distinctive act in a burnt offering, as that of a sin offering was sprinkling, and that of a peace offering the sacrificial meal, and by casting <span class="cmt_word">salt</span> upon the carcass, a feature in every meat offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), and here added probably to intensify the idea of purification. "In the corrosive and antiseptic property of salt there is hidden something of the purifying and consuming nature of fire; hence the Redeemer, in <a href="../../par/mark/9-49.htm">Mark 9:49</a>, combines the salting of the sacrifice with the purifying fire of self- denial" (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 145). The significance of it should be an expression of complete self-surrender unto Jehovah, as the necessary outcome of the antecedent act of expiation. The time of its presentation should be immediately after the cleansing of the altar on the second day, and presumably also on the succeeding days. Whether the burnt offering was, as Keil maintains, or was not, as Kliefoth contends, offered also on the first day is difficult to decide, though the former opinion has, perhaps, most in its favor. The Mosaic ritual always enjoined a burnt offering to be offered as a sequel to the sin offering (comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/29-14.htm">Exodus 29:14, 18</a>, with  <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-14.htm">Leviticus 8:14, 18</a>; and see Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 86); and, in accordance with this, vers. 23 and 24 naturally follow on vers. 19-21, ver. 22 being interposed because of the variation in the sin offering for the second day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-24.htm">Ezekiel 43:24</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up <i>for</i> a burnt offering unto the LORD.</div><div class="comm">

Hitzig reckons these as additional to the first (ver. 19) and second (ver. 22) days; Kliefoth begins them with the second; Keil, Schroder, Currey, and the majority of expositors take them as inclusive of the first and second. Hitzig's proposal may be set aside, since it cannot be maintained without erasing "thou shalt make atonement for it" in ver. 20, and the first half of the present verse. In favor of Kliefoth's view may be urged that the first day appears to stand out from the others, 'and to be distinguished by the peculiar character of its offering - a young bullock for a sin offering, without any accompanying burnt offering; that the offerings on the second and subsequent days are alike, a he-goat and a ram; that on each of the seven days a goat is mentioned for a sin offering, whereas on the first day it was a young bullock that was slain; and that in <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a> occurs an allusion to what seems a special day such as this first day of Ezekiel. In support of Keil's interpretation it is contended that the seven days were to be employed in purging or making atonement for, and purifying the altar, which was in part at least (even admitting a distinction in meaning between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>) the business of the first day; that the general statement in ver. 20 as to a goat for a sin offering on the seven days admits of easy qualification by the previous statement in ver. 19; and that seven days was the normal duration of religious solemnities under the Law (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8, 9</a>).

Smend thinks it strange that only the purification of the altar should be mentioned here, while that of the sanctuary is referred to later (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-18.htm">Ezekiel 45:18</a>), and finds in this an explanation (at least, perhaps) of the fact that in <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> only the consecration of the Mosaic altar - not of the Mosaic tabernacle - is reported. He conceives it likely that the author of <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a> copied Ezekiel, but does not explain why Ezekiel may not have copied the author of <a href="../../par/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And they shall consecrate themselves</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">they - i.e.</span> the priests - <span class="accented">shall consecrate it</span>; literally, <span class="accented">fill</span> <span class="accented">its hand</span>. The phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, "to fill one's hand," sc. with gifts, occurs with reference to Jehovah (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-29.htm">Exodus 32:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-5.htm">1 Chronicles 29:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-31.htm">2 Chronicles 29:31</a>). It is also employed in the sense of filling the hand of another, as e.g. of a priest, with sacrificial gifts, when he is instituted into his sacred office (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>; comp, <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-27.htm">Leviticus 8:27</a>). Here the hand to be filled is that of the altar, which is personified for the purpose (compare the use of the terms "bosom" and "lip" in connection with the altar). The meaning is that the altar, at its consecration, should have a plentiful supply of gifts, to symbolize that the offering of such gifts was the work for which it was set apart, and that it should never be without them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-27.htm">Ezekiel 43:27</a></div><div class="verse">And when these days are expired, it shall be, <i>that</i> upon the eighth day, and <i>so</i> forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord GOD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The eighth day, and so forward</span>. Omit "so." With this day the regular sacrificial service should commence. Thenceforward the priests should offer upon the altar <span class="cmt_word">the burnt offerings and peace offerings</span> of the people. The omission of sin offerings is explained by Keil, on the principle that "burnt offerings" and "peace offerings" were "the principal and most frequent sacrifices, whilst sin offerings and meat offerings were implied therein;" Kliefoth adding that <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-27.htm">Ezekiel 44:27, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17, 19, 22, 23, 25</a>; and Ezekiel 46:20 show it cannot be inferred that sin offerings were no more to be offered on this altar. At the same time, the prominence given to "burnt" and "peace" as distinguished from "sin offerings" may, as Schroder suggests, have pointed to the fact that the sacrificers who should use this altar would be "a people in a state of grace," to whom Jehovah was prepared to say, <span class="cmt_word">I will accept you</span>, not your offerings alone, but your persons as well; and not these because of those, but contrariwise, these on account of these. Kliefoth's idea, that the first day symbolized the future day of Christ's sacrifice, that the seven intermediate days (on his hypothesis) pointed to the period of the Christian Church, and that the eighth day looked forward to the time of the end, while not without elements of truth, is open to this objection, that in the period of the Christian Church there should have been "no more sacrifice for sin;" and yet, as Kliefoth admits, "sin offerings" were afterwards to be made upon this altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/42.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 42"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 42" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/44.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 44"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 44" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/44.htm"><title>Ezekiel 44 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/44.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/44.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/44-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/43.htm" title="Ezekiel 43">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 44 <a href="../ezekiel/45.htm" title="Ezekiel 45">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it <i>was</i> shut.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> <span class="accented">- The relation of the prince to the sanctuary</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gate of the outward sanctuary</span>, <span class="accented">the outer gate of the sanctuary</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">which looketh toward the east</span>.

Whether Ezekiel stood upon the outside of this door as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>, or upon its inside, cannot as yet be determined; but in either ease he observed that it was shut - again, whether on the east side towards the temple precincts, or on the west towards the outer court, is not mentioned, and cannot at this stage be decided. What led the seer to notice that the gate was closed was probably the circumstance that the last time he stood beside it it was open (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-1.htm">Ezekiel 43:1</a>), though proof cannot be given that he passed through it (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-5.htm">Ezekiel 43:5</a>), conjoined with the fact that it formed the principal entrance to the temple, and as such had been described to him and measured (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>).

That the gate of the new temple was to be closed only on the six working days Ewald mistakenly infers from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a>, where he reads, after the LXX., the outer instead of the inner court. But <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1</a> refers to the east gate of the inner court. Of the east gate of the outer court it is declared emphatically that <span class="cmt_word">it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it,</span> meaning that it should be closed in perpetuity; and that not, as Abar-banel and Lightfoot have supposed, to express the idea that the glory of Jehovah should no more depart from the temple, but abide in it forever, but to inspire an exalted conception of the sanctity of the "house" and all its belongings, as Jehovah explained, <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</span>

The Revised Version accurately renders the words, <span class="accented">As for the prince</span>, <span class="accented">he shall sit therein as prince</span>, etc. That the "prince" here alluded to (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) could not have been the Prince David, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Messiah already spoken of (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-24.htm">Ezekiel 37:24</a>), but must have denoted the civic authorities of the new community of Israel, "the civil head of the theocracy," Havernick infers from <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-8.htm">Ezekiel 45:8, 9</a>, where the coming "prince" is contrasted with Israel's previous rulers who oppressed their subjects, from the absence of some such characteristic predicate as "shepherd" or "king," which would, he thinks, have been attached to the word "prince" had it been intended to designate Messiah, from the prince's offering for himself a sin offering (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-22.htm">Ezekiel 45:22</a>), from the allusion to his sons (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-16.htm">Ezekiel 46:16</a>), and from what is recorded about his behavior in worship (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-2.htm">Ezekiel 46:2</a>); but none of these statements concerning the "prince' forbids his identification with Messiah, unless on the supposition that it was already understood Messiah should be a Divine-human Personage. This, however, had not then been so distinctly revealed as to be widely and accurately known. Hence it seems enough to say that while the "prince" would have his highest antitype in the Messiah, he would also have, though in a lower and lesser degree, an antitype in every righteous ruler (if ever there should be such) who might subsequently preside over Israel (see on Ezekiel 37:25). The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">to eat bread before the Lord,</span> while referring in the first instance to those sacrificial meals which, under the Law, commonly accompanied unbloody offerings, as the meat offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3</a>), the showbread (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-9.htm">Leviticus 24:9</a>), and the unleavened leaves of the Passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-18.htm">Exodus 12:18</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/28-17.htm">Numbers 28:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>), and could only be partaken of by the priests, in the second instance signified to partake of sacrificial meals in general, even of such as consisted of the portions of flesh which were eaten in connection with ordinary bloody offerings (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>). If, after Kliefoth, the former be adopted as the import of the phrase here, then the thought will be that in the new cultus the prince should enjoy a privilege which under the old was not possessed even by the king; if, after Keil, the second view be preferred, the sense will amount to this, that under the regulations of the future the prince should have the favor accorded him "of holding his sacrificial meals in the gate," whereas the people should only be permitted to hold theirs "in the court," or "in the vicinity of the sacrificial kitchens." <span class="cmt_word">The way of the porch</span> is mentioned as the ingress and egress for the prince; which implies that he should obtain access to the outer court by either the north or the south gate, since the outer door of the east gate was shut. This renders it probable that Ezekiel was himself standing on the outside of the east gate (see on ver. 1).

Ewald, Havernick, Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Currey restrict the designation "strangers" to unfaithful and unauthorized priests, who, as in the days of Israel's apostasy, notoriously under Jeroboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-15.htm">2 Chronicles 11:15</a>), may, in the confluence of idolatries that took place in Jerusalem during the reigns of Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3, 4, 10-15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2-4, 23-25</a>) and Manasseh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-7, 11, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-2.htm">2 Chronicles 33:2-7</a>), have been admitted to participate in the temple services; but Kliefoth, Delitzsch, Keil, Smend, and Plumptre, with better judgment, recognize in the "strangers" foreigners who had not incorporated themselves with Israel by submitting to circumcision, but, though dwelling in the midst of Israel, were still uncircumcised heathen in both heart and flesh. With regard to these foreigners, the Law of Moses (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8, 10</a>) enacted that, by accepting circumcision, they might become members of the Israelitish commonwealth, but that without this they could not be permitted to partake of the Passover, the highest symbol of national and religious unity (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>). Nevertheless, it was open to them, on giving a certain measure of obedience to the Law (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-26.htm">Leviticus 18:26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16, 22</a>), to enter the sanctuary and present all sorts of offerings to Jehovah (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-14.htm">Numbers 15:14, 29</a>) Hence Israel's offence had not been the admission of such "sons of the stranger" into the sanctuary, but the admission of them without insisting on the above specified conditions, in other words, the admission of such as not only lacked the bodily mark of circumcision - which would not have excluded them - but were destitute as well of the first elements of Hebrew piety, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> were as uncircumcised in heart as they were in the flesh. The sanctioning of such within the temple courts, while Jehovah's bread, the fat and the blood, was being offered, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> while sacrificial worship was being performed, was not simply a desecration of the "house," but was an express violation of the covenant Jehovah had made with Israel with reference to these very "sons of the stranger."

From this it has been argued, by Wellhausen, Smend, Driver, and others, that the "strangers" above mentioned had been not only allowed access to the outer court as spectators or as worshippers while the priests were offering sacrifice, but admitted to the inner court as assistants to the priests in their altar duties, that this, the employment of these heathen hierodules, had been the special wickedness of which Israel had been guilty, and that henceforward these "foreign ministers" were to be thrust out from their offices, and their places supplied by the about-to-be-degraded Levites. It is, however, doubtful if the phrase, <span class="accented">keepers of my charge in the sanctuary</span>, can be made to signify more than has already been expressed by the clause, "to be in my sanctuary...  when ye offer my bread" (ver. 7), by which, as Kliefoth and Keil explain, Israel had practically made these strangers "keepers of Jehovah's charge," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> observers of the rites of worship prescribed by him, though observers in their way, not in his; if more can be extracted from the words, then the most they can be legitimately made to affirm (as there is no mention of the inner court) is that these "strangers," in addition to obtaining access to the outer court to witness the sacrifices, or perhaps offer such for themselves, had been more or less frequently employed in performing subordinate offices towards the Levites, who were the proper priests' assistants, like the Gibeonites, whom Joshua (Joshua 9:27) made "hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the Lord unto this day," and like the Nethinim, whom, according to Ezra (Ezra 8:20), David and the princes had given for the service of the Levites (see Delitzsch, Luthardt's 'Zeitschrift fur kirchliche Wissenschaft,' 1880, p. 283). (On the phrase, "to keep the charge of Jehovah," as signifying to follow his directions or comply with his prescriptions, see <a href="../../par/numbers/9-23.htm">Numbers 9:23</a>.) "In the sanctuary" explains that the prescriptions alluded to were those pertaining to the sanctuary or to the worship of Jehovah.

If the "prince" is omitted, the reason probably was that a special section is subsequently devoted to him (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1-8</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- The ordinance for the people</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No stranger</span> (or, <span class="accented">alien</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary.</span> The publication of this edict marked a clear advance upon preceding legislation. The old Torah conceded right of access to a foreigner, though uncircumcised, on certain conditions (ver. 7); this new Torah would accord such right of access to a foreigner on no conditions. Even should he be circumcised in the flesh, unless he possessed also that which the bodily mark symbolized, viz. circumcision of heart, he must remain without.

According to the so-called priest-code, the Levites were Levi's descendants, who were chosen by Jehovah for service in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6-13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9</a>), to minister to the priests when these sacrificed in the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/numbers/8-19.htm">Numbers 8:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>), and in particular to keep the charge of the tabernacle, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the house and all its vessels (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>), as distinguished from the charge of the sanctuary and of the altar, which pertained to Aaron and his sons alone as priests (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2-6, 23</a>). The Deuteronomic code, says Wellhausen ('Geschichte Israels,' pp. 121, etc.), was unacquainted with any such distinction between Levites and priests, who, it is alleged, composed one homogeneous body, the tribe of Levi, whose members were equally empowered to officiate at the altar (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), the lower duties of the tabernacle having been performed by the aforesaid strangers, and the subordination of Levites to priests having first been suggested by Ezekiel (comp.

"Leviten;" Oehler, in Herzog's 'Real-Encyclopadie,' art. "Levi"). The question, therefore, of which Levites Ezekiel speaks in this verse, whether of those whose duties were of a menial order or of those whose functions partook of a priestly character, is not difficult to resolve. It could hardly have been the former, since in vers. 11-14 Ezekiel's Levites are represented as about to be degraded by being relegated to inferior tasks than those they had formerly performed; it must have been the latter, because in the present verse they are designated the <span class="cmt_word">Levites that are gone away</span> (or, <span class="accented">went</span>) <span class="cmt_word">far from me, when Israel went astray</span>. Now, Israel's apostasy from Jehovah and declension towards idolatry began with Solomon's unfaithfulness (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4-8</a>), and continued with greater or less intensity in every subsequent reign till the exile; it certainly cannot be restricted, as Keil and Currey propose, to Jeroboam's conduct in setting up rival sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel, with altars and priests, for the accommodation of the northern kingdom (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-33</a>). Nor is there room for doubting, although historical notices of the fact are not abundant, that in this apostasy the priesthood largely led the way (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-7.htm">Jeremiah 26:7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-11.htm">2 Kings 16:11-16</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4</a>), becoming priests of the high places, ministering for the people at heathen altars, and so causing them to fall into iniquity (ver. 12). Hengstenberg and Plumptre suggest that the reason why these apostate priests are now called Levites was to intimate that they were no more worthy of the priesthood, and were about to be reduced to the lower ministry of the Levites so called. Consequently, under the new Torah, those among the priests (who were also Levites) who had been guilty of this flagrant wickedness (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, says Delitzsch, all the Aaronides who were not Zadokitos) would no more, either in themselves or their descendants, be suffered to retain the priestly office, but would be degraded to the status of ordinary Levites, and, like them, should be <span class="cmt_word">ministers</span> in Jehovah's <span class="cmt_word">sanctuary</span>, having <span class="cmt_word">charge</span> <span class="accented">- or</span>, <span class="accented">oversight</span> (Revised Version) - at the gates of the house, and ministering, to (or, <span class="accented">in</span>) the house, i.e. in its courts, serving as keepers of the charge of the house (ver. 14), as watchers at the gates of the house (ver. 11), as slaughterers of the sacrificial victims (ver. 11), but should not, like their brethren who had remained faithful, be allowed to do the office of a priest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> approach the altar to offer sacrifice, or to enter into the holy place (ver. 13). In this way they should bear <span class="cmt_word">their iniquity</span> (vers. 10,12) - a favorite expression in the middle books of the Pentateuch (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38, 43</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/5-31.htm">Numbers 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>), but never occurring in Deuteronomy, and meaning "to be requited" on account of, and make expiation for, sin and <span class="cmt_word">their shame and their abominations</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the shame due to them for their abominations - a specially Ezekelian phrase (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52, 54</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a>).

The priesthood, at its institution, having been entrusted to Aaron and his sons (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-9.htm">Exodus 29:9, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/25-13.htm">Numbers 25:13</a>), on Aaron's death the high priesthood passed into the hands of Eleazar, his eldest (living) son (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-26.htm">Numbers 20:26-28</a>), and after Eleazar's death into those of Phinehas, his eldest son (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11-13</a>). In the last days of the judges, when the ark and tabernacle stood at Shiloh, the high priesthood belonged to Eli, of the line of Ithamar (comp. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and 1 Sam 22:20 with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-3.htm">1 Chronicles 24:3</a>), in which line it continued till the reign of David, when it was held conjointly by Abiathar (called also Ahimelech) of the line of Ithamar, and Zadok of the line of Eleazar (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>). This arrangement, however, Solomon eventually overturned, by deposing the former for espousing Adonijah's pretensions to the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-7.htm">1 Kings 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and from that time forward till the exile the high priesthood remained with Zadok and his sons (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). When, therefore, it is announced to Ezekiel that his vision-sanctuary should have as <span class="cmt_word">priests the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of Jehovah's sanctuary, when the children of Israel went astray from him</span>; the first question that arises is - To <span class="accented">what does this allude?</span> Kliefoth holds it cannot mean that, while Israel as a whole declined into idolatry, the Zadokite priests remained faithful to the worship of Jehovah, because the vision of Judah's idolatries granted to the prophet, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-16.htm">Ezekiel 8:16</a>, revealed quite clearly that the priesthood was as much caught in the national apostasy as were the princes or the people. Nor is the language of the text perfectly satisfied by the view of  Havernick, Keil, Delitzsch, and others, that it goes beck to Zadok's fidelity to the throne of David at the time of Absalom's rebellion (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>), a fidelity exhibited also by Abiathar, or to his adherence to Solomon in preference to Adonijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8, 39</a>), this time without Abiathar's concurrence, rather in the face of his opposition. In neither of these instances was Zadok's fidelity specially directed towards Jehovah's sanctuary, but concerned expressly and exclusively David's throne. Hence the commendation of the Zadokites' fidelity can only signify that, while the priesthood as a body were corrupt like the people, there were among them, as among the people, some who, like Ezekiel, continued steadfast to Jehovah's sanctuary; that these faithful few were Zadokites (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-11.htm">Ezekiel 48:11</a>), and that to these should be entrusted the priesthood in the new sanctuary. But, at this point, a second question <span class="accented">starts - Was it intended to declare that the new priesthood should be Zadokites in body</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of lineal descent, or <span class="accented">only in soul</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in respect of moral and religious excellence? The former is contended by Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, and others, who see in the vision-sanctuary a plan of the second, or post-exilic, temple, and in its ordinances a program for the establishment of the Levitical hierarchy; but this contention shatters itself on the fact that no proof exists either that the second temple was constructed after Ezekiel's as a model, or that those who served in it were exclusively flesh and blood Zadokites. The latter opinion, favored by Kliefoth, appears the more correct, that moral and spiritual resemblance to the sons of Zadok should form the first qualification for the priesthood in this ideal sanctuary of the future (see note at the end of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>.).

The reason for the prohibition of wool is hinted at in ver. 18 - it was apt to cause sweat, and thus entail impurity; the clean white linen, on the other hand, was designed both for hygienic reasons and as an emblem of purity (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8, 14</a>).

The obligation to let the hair grow freely was imposed upon the Nazarite only during the period of his vow (<a href="../../par/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). The verb "to poll," or "cut" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>), occurs nowhere else. Smend thinks what is here denied to the priests collectively is in the priest-code denied solely to the high priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, Revised Version; compare, however, <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-6.htm">Leviticus 10:6</a>, Revised Version), and discovers in this a sign of the later origin of Leviticus. Ezekiel's raising the priesthood as a body to the rank of the high priest, of whom in connection with this temple is no trace, rather proves Ezekiel to have been later than Leviticus.

Ezekiel's enactment discovers two variations - first, that it does not formally forbid to the priests marriage with a harlot; and, second, that it sanctions marriage with a priest's widow. But the first was implied in the prohibition of marriage with an adulteress, and the second was a sign of the higher sanctity of the priesthood belonging to Ezekiel's temple. Hence, so far from indicating the priority of Ezekiel, it rather points to the priority of Leviticus.

As under the Law, so in the ideal constitution of Ezekiel, the priests should not be at liberty to contract ceremonial impurity through touching a corpse except in the case of near relations (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a>). That neither in Leviticus nor in Ezekiel is the priest's wife among the excepted is surprising, and hardly to be explained, with Knobel, on the ground that a wife is not a blood-relation, since according to the Divine conception of marriage husband and wife are one (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), but either by holding, with Keil, that the wife, who stands nearer her husband than any of the relatives named, was viewed as included under the phrase, "and for his kin that is near unto him" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-2.htm">Leviticus 21:2</a>), or by supposing it self-evident that such defilement could not be avoided in the case of a wife and was therefore tacitly allowed. Smend, as usual, finds signs of Ezekiel's priority to the priest-code, first in the circumstance that Ezekiel regarded it as perfectly natural that a priest should sorrow for his wife (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-18</a>), which showed he had no acquaintance with <a href="../../par/leviticus/21.htm">Leviticus 21</a>; and secondly, in the fact that <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> prohibits absolutely to the high priest all contact with a corpse, which, it is argued, betrays a greater strictness than existed in the days of Ezekiel. But as the prohibition in <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11</a> applies only to the high priest, who in Ezekiel's temple has no place, an argument as to which of the books had priority of origin cannot properly be founded on so insecure a Basis. Knobel remarks on <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-4</a> that "among the Greeks, priests and priestesses remained at a distance from funerals (Plato, 'De Legg.,' 12. p. 947); while among the Romans ought the <span class="accented">Flamen dialis</span> to touch no corpse (Gell., 10:15), the augur perform no funeral rites (Tacit., 'Ann.,' 1:31), and the pontifex accompany no funeral procession (Die Cass., 56:31); not at all should he behold a dead body (Serv., 'Ad AEn.,' 6:176),and in case he had occasion to pronounce a funeral oration, a curtain should hang between him and the corpse." As to the cleansing of a defiled priest, that should be conducted in accordance with the customary regulations (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/19.htm">Numbers 19</a>.),with this difference - that on the termination of the ordinary rites, which extended over seven days, an additional seven days, according to Havernick and Keil (though Hengstenberg and Plumptre decide for only one heptade), should elapse, at the end of which, on the presentation of a sin offering, he should be restored to service in the inner sanctuary.

Smend thinks Ezekiel was scarcely accurate in describing the priests as landless in the sense intended by the Deuteronomist and the priest-code, since in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-4.htm">Ezekiel 45:4</a> they are, after all, furnished with a plot of ground on which to build their houses and erect their sanctuary; whilst Wellhansen ('Gesehichte Israels,' p. 165) holds the priest-code to have somewhat romanced in adopting the same language about the Aaronides and Levites, since, if they really did obtain forty-eight cities, "what were these if not a lot and a land tract, and that too a comparatively great and important one?"

The burnt offering is omitted, because it was entirely consumed upon the altar, with the exception of the hide or skin, which under the Law became a perquisite of the officiating priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-8.htm">Leviticus 7:8</a>). That Ezekiel is silent about this, while the requirement of <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a>, that the priest should obtain the breast with the right shoulder of every fire offering, goes beyond the prescription of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>, that the shoulder, two cheeks, and the maw should be the priest's portion, is regarded by Wellhausen and Smend as a proof that Ezekiel stands between Deuteronomy and the priest-code. But as Ezekiel does not condescend upon the particular parts which should be reserved from the fire offerings, it is impossible to say whether he held with the Deuteronomist or the writer of the priest-code, supposing them to be different; and, inasmuch as <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30</a> speaks of an offerings, by fire that was first paid to Jehovah and by him afterwards handed over to Aaron and his sons, while <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a> treats of the dues which should be paid by the people directly to the priests, it is clear that both practices may have existed together instead of the one (the former) coming in as an advance upon the other (the latter); see Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschDeuteronomy 18:3.

As the territory of Canaan had been originally divided by lot among the twelve tribes after the conquest (comp. <a href="../../par/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-54.htm">Numbers 33:54</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-6.htm">Joshua 13:6</a>, etc.), this same method of allocating the soil amongst the new community should be followed on a second time taking possession of it after the exile. Currey believes the phrase, "divide by lot," "does not imply anything like casting lots, but is equivalent to our notion of <span class="accented">allotment</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> several portions being assigned by rule." There is, however, little doubt "lots" were cast to determine, if not the actual size, at least the precise situation, of each tribe's territory (see REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschNumbers 26:54 <span class="commentary">Keil</span> and 'Pulpit Commentary' on Numbers 26:54). That no such methodical distribution of Canaan ever took place, or for that matter could hays taken place amongst the returned exiles, should be proof sufficient that the prophet here moves in the region of the ideal and symbolical rather than of the real and literal. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer an oblation</span> -literally, <span class="accented">lift up a heave offering</span> (comp. Ezekiel 44:80; <a href="../../par/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-28.htm">Exodus 29:28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/22-12.htm">Leviticus 22:12</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-19.htm">Numbers 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-24.htm">Numbers 18:24</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord, an holy portion of the land;</span> literally, a <span class="accented">holy</span> (portion) <span class="accented">from the land</span>. Very significantly, in the new partition of Palestine the Lord's portion should be the first to be marked off and solemnly dedicated to Jehovah for the purposes to be forthwith specified. Those who, like Wellhansen and Smend, perceive in this allotment of land to Jehovah, and therefore to the priests, a  contradiction to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-28.htm">Ezekiel 44:28</a>, omit to notice first that Jehovah required some place on which his sanctuary might be erected, and the priests some ground on which to build houses for themselves; and secondly, that, so far as the priests were concerned, the laud was given by the people, not to them, but to Jehovah, and by him to them (comp. on Ezekiel 44:28). The exact site of this <span class="accented">terumah</span>, or "holy portion," is afterwards indicated (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>); meanwhile its dimensions are recorded. <span class="cmt_word">The length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand</span>. Whether "reeds" or "cubits" should be supplied after "thousand" has divided expositors. Bottcher, Hitzig, Ewald, Hengstenberg, and Smend decide for "cubits," principally on the grounds that "cubits" are mentioned in ver. 2; that "cubits" have been the usual measure hitherto, even (as they contend) in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>; and that otherwise the dimensions of this sacred territory must have been colossal, in fact, out of all proportion to the Holy Land, viz. about 720 square miles (25,000 reeds, or 42.5 miles, &times; 10,000 reeds, or 17 miles,   =   722.5 square miles). Havernick, Keil, <span class="accented">Kliefoth</span>, Currey, and Plumptre favor "reeds," chiefly for the reasons that in ver. 2 "cubits" are specified, and are therefore to be regarded as exceptional; that the customary measuring instrument throughout has been a reed (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16</a>); and that the dimensions, which Ezekiel designed should be colossal (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>), correspond exactly with the measurements afterwards given in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48.htm">Ezekiel 48</a>, if these he in reeds, but not if they be in cubits. As to the breadth of this <span class="accented">terumah</span> from east to west, Hitzig, Keil, <span class="accented">Smend</span>, Schroder, and Plumptre follow the LXX. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in substituting 20,000 for 10,000, considering that the space referred to in ver. 3 appears as if meant to be taken from an already measured larger area, which could only be that of ver. 1 - the portion in ver. 1 being the whole territory assigned to the priests and Levites, and that in ver. 3 the allotment for the priests. Kliefoth, however, contends that no necessity exists for tampering with the text, and certainly if vers. 1-4 be regarded as descriptive of the priests' portion <span class="accented">only</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> in the phrase, "of this measure" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>), in ver. 8 be rendered "according to" - a sense it may have (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>), the supposed difficulty disappears. In this case the demonstrative this in the last clause will refer to the priests' portion exclusively; in the former ease, to the whole portion of the priests and Levites. That <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-14.htm">Ezekiel 48:14</a> declares the Levites' portion to be "holy unto the land" does not prove it must have been included in the holy <span class="accented">terumah</span> of ver. 1 Nor does this concession follow, as will appear, from ver. 7. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a></div><div class="verse">Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred <i>in length</i>, with five hundred <i>in breadth</i>, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Of this district</span>, either of 25,000 &times; 10,000, or 25,000 &times; 20,000 reeds, according to the view taken of ver. 1, there should be measured off for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth. The supplement here also, <span class="accented">Keil</span>, Kliefoth, Plumptre, and others consider to be "reeds," since obviously the whole temple with its precincts is intended (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/42-16.htm">Ezekiel 42:16-20</a>), though Hengstenberg and Schroder prefer "cubits," holding the sanctuary to be the temple buildings enclosed within the outer court well (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40.htm">Ezekiel 40</a>.). The free space of <span class="cmt_word">fifty cubits round about for the suburbs</span> (or, <span class="accented">open places</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>thereof</span> seems to indicate that the larger area was that alluded to by the prophet. That the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. occurs more frequently in the so-called priest-code (Leviticus 25:84; <a href="../../par/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2, 3, 4, 5, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2, 3, 8, 11, 13</a>, etc.) and in the Chronicles (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-16.htm">1 Chronicles 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-35.htm">1 Chronicles 6:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-14.htm">2 Chronicles 11:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-19.htm">2 Chronicles 31:19</a>) than in Ezekiel (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-15.htm">Ezekiel 48:15, 17</a>) is a fact; but on this fact cannot be founded an argument for the priority of Ezekiel, since it rather points to Ezekiel's acquaintance with such "suburbs" in connection with priestly and Levitical cities.

The exact position of the sanctuary in the <span class="accented">priests</span>' portion is afterwards stated to have been in the midst (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-8.htm">Ezekiel 48:8</a>).

Kliefoth and Curroy retain the word "chambers "as in the text, and think the "chambers" and the "land" were two distinct possessions of the Levites, the chambers having been within (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-17.htm">Ezekiel 40:17, 18</a>) as the land was without the sanctuary. Rosenm&uuml;ller, Havernick, Hengstenberg, and Schroder decide for "chambers," or "courts," rows of dwellings standing outside the sanctuary as the priests' chambers were located within. Havernick supposes that along with these, which were obviously designed to be employed when the Levites were on duty, there may have been other Levitical towns and dwellings, Hengstenberg conceives them as having been "barracks for the Levites, the inhabitants of which used the twentieth part of the land assigned to them as pasturage." Unfavorable to the first view is the fact that it requires the text to be altered. Against the second is its awkward dividing of the verse and unexpected interjection of a reference to cells within the sanctuary while speaking of the land without. The third, while not free from difficulty as taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> to be equivalent to "cell-buildings," is perhaps the best. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a></div><div class="verse">And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the oblation of the holy <i>portion</i>: it shall be for the whole house of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - In addition to the holy terumah for the priests and the portion for the Levites, should be marked off as <span class="cmt_word">the possession of the city</span> a third tract of territory, <span class="cmt_word">five thousand</span> (reeds) <span class="cmt_word">broad, and five and twenty thousand long</span>, <span class="cmt_word">over against</span> - rather, <span class="accented">side by side with</span> (Revised Version), "parallel to" (Keil) - <span class="cmt_word">the oblation of the holy portion</span>. That is to say, it should lie upon the south, as the Levites' territory lay upon the north of the priests' portion. Adding the 10,000 reeds of breadth for the Levites' domain, the 10,000 for the priests' land, and the 5000 for the city quarter, makes a total breadth of 25,000 reeds; so that the tract in which all these were included was a square. That the portion for the city should be <span class="cmt_word">for the whole house of Israel</span> implied that it should be communal property, belonging to no tribe in particular, but to all the tribes together - in modern phrase should be "common good, <span class="accented">ein</span> <span class="accented">Volksgut</span> (Kliefoth), which should neither be confiscated by kingly rapacity (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>) nor invaded by individual and private appropriation, but retained for the use of the inhabitants generally (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-18.htm">Ezekiel 48:18, 19</a>).

That Israel in former times had suffered from the oppressions and exactions of her kings, from Solomon downwards, as Samuel had predicted she would (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>), was matter of history (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4, 10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-35.htm">2 Kings 23:35</a>), and was perhaps partly explained, though not justified, by the fact that the kings had no crown lands assigned them for their support. This excuse, however, for regal tyranny should in future cease, as a sufficient portion of land should be allocated to the prince and his successors, who accordingly should <span class="cmt_word">give</span>, or <span class="accented">leave</span>, the rest of the <span class="cmt_word">land to the house of Israel according to their tribes</span>. The use of "princes" does not show, as Hengstenberg asserts, that "under the ideal unity of the prince in Ezekiel, a numerical plurality is included," and that "these who understand by the prince merely the Messiah must here do violence to the text;" but simply, as Kliefoth explains, that Ezekiel was thinking of Israel's past kings, and contrasting with them the rulers Israel might have in the future, without affirming that these should be many or one (see on Ezekiel 44:3).

The "gerah," value two pence, was the smallest silver coin; the "shekel," therefore, was forty pence, or 3s. 4d. Commentators are divided as to how the second half of this verse should be understood: <span class="cmt_word">twenty shekel, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.</span> The "maneh" (or "portion," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, "to be divided"), which occurs only here and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a>; and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-71.htm">Nehemiah 7:71, 72</a> - "that is to say, only in books written during the Captivity or subsequent to it" (Keil) - was probably the same coin as the Greek rains (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>), though its weight may have somewhat differed. A comparison of <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a> with <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-16.htm">2 Chronicles 9:16</a> shows that a maneh was equal to a hundred shekels, which cannot be made to harmonize with the statement in this verse without supposing either that an error has crept in through transcription, or that the chronicler has employed the late Greek style of reckoning, in which one mina is equivalent to a hundred drachmas. Again, the Hebrew and Attic talents, when ex-stained, fail to solve the problem as to how the text should be rendered. The Hebrew talent, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, contained 3000 sacred or Mosaic shekels according to <a href="../../par/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25, 26</a>; and the Attic talon 60 minas, each of 100 drachmas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 6000 drachmas, or 3000 drachmas, each of which again was equal to a Hebrew shekel. Hence the Attic mina must have been one-sixtieth part of 3000, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels, which once more fails to correspond with Ezekiel's notation. What this notation is depends on how the clauses should be connected. If with "and," <span class="accented">as</span> Ewald, following the Targumists, thinks, Ezekiel is supposed to have ordained that in the future the maneh should be, not 50, but 60 (20 + 25 -1- 15) shekels - the weight of the 'Babylonian <span class="accented">mana</span> ('Records of the Past,' 4:97, second series); only, if he so intended, one sees not why he should have adopted this roundabout method of expression instead of simply stating that henceforth the maneh should be sixty shekels If with "or," as Michaelis, Gesenius, Hitzig, and Hengstenberg prefer, then the prophet is regarded as asserting that in the future three manehs of varying values should be current - one of gold, another of silver, and a third of copper (Hitzig), or all of the same metal, but of different magnitudes (Michaelis); and this arrangement might well have been appointed for the future, although no historical trace can be found of any such manehs of twenty, twenty-five, and fifteen shekels respectively having been in circulation either <span class="accented">among</span> the Hebrews or among foreign peoples. Kliefoth pronounces both solutions unsatisfactory, but has nothing better to offer. Keil supposes a corruption of the text of old standing, for the correction of which we are as yet without materials. Bertheau and Havernick follow the LXX. (Cod.

Thus the demands of Ezekiel's Torah surpass those of the earlier or Mosaic Torah in quantity as well as quality. That these demands are definitely specified does not prove they should partake rather of the nature of a tax than of a free-will offering. That they were not to be regarded as taxes is shown by the absence of any allusion to penalties for neglect of payment; that they were designed to be looked upon as free-will offerings is plain from the circumstance that Jehovah never supposes for a moment that these generous offerings will be withheld; and perhaps all that is really signified by them is that the liberality of Jehovah's people in the future age should greatly exceed that which had been practiced at any former time.

Whether three festivals are referred to or only two is debated by expositors. Fairbairn, Havernick, Ewald, Keil, Schroder, and Plumptre decide for three - the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20), the Passover (vers. 21-24), and the Feast of Tabernacles (ver. 25). Kliefoth, Smend, and Curtsy find only two a Passover and a Feast of Tabernacles. Hengstenberg sees in the solemnities of the first and seventh days of the new year a special consecration service for the new temple, not to be repeated, corresponding to the dedication of the tabernacle on the first day of the first month (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-1.htm">Exodus 40:1, 17</a>), or of the Solomonic temple in the seventh month (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>),  and in imitation of which the post-exilic temple was dedicated, probably on the first day of the year (<a href="../../par/ezra/6-16.htm">Ezra 6:16-22</a>). Against the notion of a special dedication service, however, stand the facts <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the temple had been already consecrated by the entrance into it of the glory of the Lord (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-4.htm">Ezekiel 43:4</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the service here described differs in respect either of time or ritual or both from every one of the three cited dedications. Between the two other views the difference is slight. If the festival of the new year (vers. 18-20) was distinct from the Passover, it was still, by the ritual of the seventh and fourteenth days of the first month (vers. 20, 22), so closely connected with the Passover as practically to form a preparation for and introduction to it. Then the circumstance that the proper ceremonial for the new moon is afterwards described (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-6.htm">Ezekiel 46:6</a>) favors the proposal to regard the rites in vers. 18-20 as a part of the Passover festival; while this view, if adopted, will explain the omission from ver. 25 of all mention of the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-24.htm">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-1.htm">Numbers 29:1</a>), and of the great Day of Atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7</a>), with which the autumn festival was usually preceded, by showing that in lieu of these a sacrificial observance had been prefixed to the Passover on the first and seventh days of the first month. Smend's theory, that "Ezekiel's feast-calendar divides the ecclesiastical year into two halves, each of which begins with a re. conciliation ceremony (or expiatory sacrifice) on the first days of the first and seventh months respectively," would lend confirmation to the above view, were it not that the theory in question is based on an alteration of the text in ver. 20 (see Exposition). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God.</span> The usual solemn introduction prefixed to Divine enactments (comp. ver. 9; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-19.htm">Ezekiel 43:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-6.htm">Ezekiel 44:6, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/46-1.htm">Ezekiel 46:1, 16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the first month, in the first day of the month</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/8-13.htm">Genesis 8:13</a>).

Under the Mosaic Torah, the Passover began on the tenth day of the first month by the selection of a lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-6</a>), corresponding to which the great Day of Atonement in the seventh month fell upon the tenth day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-27.htm">Leviticus 23:27</a>). In the Torah of Ezekiel, the ceremonies introducing and leading up to the Passover should begin with the first day of the month, as under the Law the Feast of Trumpets on the first day of the seventh mouth practically began the solemnities which culminated in the Feast of Tabernacles. <span class="cmt_word">A young bullock without blemish</span> should form the sacrificial offering on this first day of the year, according to the ordinance published by Ezekiel; that promulgated by the Hebrew lawgiver appointed for new moons generally, in addition to the burnt and meat offerings, a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-15.htm">Numbers 28:15</a>), and particularly for the first day of the seventh month, in addition to the regular burnt and meat offerings, one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs for a burnt offering, meat offerings of flour and oil for each of these animals, and a he-goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). The object for which the Mosaic offerings were presented was to make atonement for the worshippers; the Ezekelian sacrifices should stand in more immediate relation to the place of worship, and be designed to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse the sanctuary</span> from such defilement, to be afterwards mentioned, as might be contracted from the presence in it of erring men (ver. 20).

Though the selection of the lamb upon the tenth day of the first month is not specified, it may be assumed that this would be implied in the appointment of a Passover which should begin on the day already legalized by the Mosaic Torah. According to Wellhausen and Smend, the first mention of the Passover occurs in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2, 5, 6</a>, and the next in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>; but this can only be maintained by declaring <a href="../../par/exodus/34-25.htm">Exodus 34:25</a>, which occurs in the so-called "Book of the Covenant" - a pre-Deuteronomic work - "a gloss," and by relegating <a href="../../par/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. to the "priest-code" for no other reason than that it alludes to the Passover (vers. 11, 21, 27, 43) - a principle of easy application, and capable of being used to prove anything. Smend likewise regards it as strange that the Passover should be made to commence on the fourteenth of the month, and not, as the autumn feast, on the fifteenth (ver. 25); and suggests that the original reading, which he supposes was the fifteenth, may have been corrected subsequently in accordance with the priest, code. But if the priest-cede was posterior to and modeled after Ezekiel. Why should it have ordained the fourteenth instead of that which its master recommended, viz. the fifteenth? A sufficient explanation of the differing dates in Ezekiel is supplied if Ezekiel, in fixing them, may be held to have followed the so-called priest-cede. <span class="cmt_word">A feast of seven days</span>; <span class="accented">literally</span>, <span class="accented">a feast of hebdomad of days</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). By almost all interpreters this is understood to mean "a feast of a full week, the exact duration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which began with the eating of the Paschal lamb (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8, 15-20</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-11.htm">Numbers 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3, 4</a>). At the same time, it is frankly admitted that, to extract this sense from the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> must be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. As the words stand, they can only signify a feast of weeks of days. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, in <a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>, is applied to the Feast of Pentecost, which was called "a Feast of <span class="accented">Hebdomads</span>," from the seven weeks which intervened between the Passover and it. Hence Kliefoth, adhering to the legitimate sense of the expression, understands the prophet to say that the whole period of seven weeks between the first Passover and Pentecost should be celebrated in the new dispensation as a Feast of Unleavened Bread. In support of this Kliefoth cites a similar use of the word "days" in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-14.htm">Genesis 29:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/41-1.htm">Genesis 41:1</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-3.htm">Jeremiah 28:3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2, 3</a>; and certainly no objection can be taken to a Passover of seven weeks, if Ezekiel may be supposed to have been merely expressing analogically spiritual conceptions, and not furnishing actual legislation to be afterwards put in operation. Against this translation, however, Keil urges that the expression, "seven days of the feast" (ver. 23), appears to mark the duration of the festival; but this is not so convincing as its author imagines, since the prophet may be held as describing, in vers. 23, 24, the procedure of each seven days without intending to unsay what he had already stated, that the feast should continue seven weeks of days. A second objection pressed by Keil, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> "is not usually connected with the preceding noun in the construct state, but is attached as an adverbial accusative," as in the above-cited passages, is sufficiently disposed of by Kliefoth's statement that the punctuation might easily be altered so as to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. Upon the whole, while not free from difficulty, the view of Kliefoth seems best supported by argument.

In, the first place, the "sin offering" here prescribed was manifestly to take precedence of the Paschal feast proper, whereas in the Paschal festival of the so-called priest-code the daffy sacrifices were appointed to begin  on the fifteenth after the Paschal lamb had been slain and eaten (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-8.htm">Leviticus 23:8</a>). In the second place, the sin offering was to consist of a bullock instead of a he-goat as formerly (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-22.htm">Numbers 28:22</a>). In the third place, it was not intended to be renewed on each of the seven following days of the feast, but was designed, by repeating the sacrifice of the first and seventh days, to connect these with the fourteenth, on which the feast proper opened.

That is, the same sacrifices should be offered daily throughout the seven days of this feast as had been offered during the seven days of the former feast. That this feast was designed to represent the ancient Feast of Tabernacles can scarcely be doubted, though the practice of living in booths (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40-43</a>) is not adverted to. Possibly this may have been omitted, as Keil remarks, "because the practice of living in booths would be dropped in the time to come" (see, however, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14-17</a>), or, as Kliefoth observes, "because, when Ezekiel's Torah should come into operation, the people of God would be dwelling in the eternal tabernacles of which the booths of the Mosaic Torah were but the types." Nor are the deviations of Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, in respect of the daily offerings prescribed for this feast, fewer or of less importance than those which have been noted in connection with the Passover. Ezekiel's Torah prescribes for a burnt offering seven bullocks and seven rams daily, for a sin offering a he-goat daily, for a meat offering an ephah of flour with a hin of oil for each bullock and each ram daily; the Mosaic Torah, while retaining the he goat for a sin offering, required - for a burnt offering on the first day thirteen young bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs, and so on, diminishing by one bullock each day, till the seventh, when seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen lambs should be sacrificed; and for a meal offering three-tenths of an ephah of flour for every bullock, and two-tenths of an ephah for every ram, and one-tenth of an ephah for each lamb, according to the number of bullocks, rams, and lambs for each day. In addition, the Mosaic celebration concluded with a solemn assembly with special sacrifices on the eighth day (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-39</a>), of which no mention is made in Ezekiel. Nor should it be overlooked that Ezekiel's Torah omits all reference to the other great festival that figures in the Mosaic Torah, viz. that of Pentecost, or the Feast of Weeks, as well as to the Feast of Trumpets and the great Day of Atonement (see on ver. 21), although Hengstenberg is of opinion that Ezekiel, having instanced the Passover and Tabernacles, the beginning and end of the feast-cycle already known to the Jews, designed that all the feasts which lay between should be included. Be this, however, as it may, to infer from the deviations in Ezekiel's Torah from that of Moses, as George, Vatke, Kuenen, Wellhausen, Smend, Robertson Smith, Cornill, and Driver have done, that the latter had no existence in the time of Ezekiel is, as Havernick observes, not only to render Ezekiel's representations completely unintelligible, but to beg the entire question between the newer criticism and the old faith. "How will one generally explain," asks Cornill ('Einleitung in das Alte Testament,' p. 64), "that a Jerusalem priest sets up a Torah for the future, which completely ignores the priest code (?), in all points remains far behind its requirements (?), and in a groping manner lays hold of the future, instead of appropriating to himself the finished system (i.e. of the, so-called priest code, supposing it to have then existed)? Why does Ezekiel require, in the cultus (which he sets up) so much less than <a href="../../par/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, and 29.? Where, in Ezekiel is the high priest, who for the priest code is the center of the theocracy? Where is the great Day of Atonement of <a href="../../par/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a>.?" and so on. The answer to these interrogations is that Ezekiel did not intend to republish the Mosaic Torah, but to modify it so as to meet the requirements of the new era, or (perhaps better) to express more adequately the new conceptions of religion and worship he had been commissioned to set before his fellow-exiles; and that Ezekiel had a perfect right to deal in this way even with the Mosaic Torah, inasmuch as he distinctly claimed, in committing to writing the details of his temple- vision, to be acting under special Divine guidance (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-5.htm">Ezekiel 44:5</a>). Canon Driver ('An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 133) admits that the argument from Ezekiel's deviations from the so-called priest-code in favor of the later origin of the latter, if "taken by itself, would not, perhaps, be a decisive one," and even adds that, "however doubtful it may be whether Ezekiel presupposes the <span class="accented">completed</span> priests' code, it is difficult not to conclude that he presupposes <span class="accented">parts</span> of it" ibid., p. 138). But if none of it existed before Ezekiel, then a counter-question to that of Cornill may be put, "How is it to be explained that the unknown author of the priests' code should have allowed himself to deviate so far from the arrangements which Ezekiel, a prophet acting under Jehovah's guidance, had established?" The natural reply is that when the priests' code was composed, Ezekiel's Torah did not exist. If the newer criticism believes that Ezekiel would not have deviated so largely as he has done from the rites prescribed in the priests' code had these been in operation and invested with authority (see 'Drivel', 'An Introduction,' etc., p. 133), the newer criticism should explain how the priests' code came to deviate from the Torah of Ezekiel, which, if it was not then in actual operation, was at least invested with Divine authority. Is it not every way as logical to infer, from the deviations of the priests' code (supposing it to be post-exilic) from the Torah of Ezekiel, that the author of the priests' code could not have known of the existence of Ezekiel's Torah, and therefore that it could not then have been in existence, as <span class="accented">vice versa</span> that Ezekiel had no acquaintance with the priests' code, and that therefore it had not in his day been composed? The impartial reasoner, with no theory to uphold, will recognize that the two arguments run exactly purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/44.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 44"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 44" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/46.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 46"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 46" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening.

Kliefoth, who takes "this gate" to signify the outer gate, through which, according to his interpretation of ver. 2 (see above), the prince should pass so as to reach the inner east gate, conceives the import of the present verse to be that, while the prince should be permitted on the sabbaths and new moons to pass through the eastern gate, the people "should remain standing in front of the outer east gate, and, looking through it and the opened inner east gate, should pray before Jehovah." This, however, is unnatural, even on the hypothesis that the prince should pass through the outer east gate, and the view of Keil is greatly preferable, that "this gate" was <span class="accented">the inner east gate</span>, and that the people should reach it (even if the prince did not) by entering the outer court through the north gate or the south.

In order to prevent confusion, and that all might be conducted with propriety (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>), no one should depart by the gate through which he had entered, but by the opposite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he who had entered by the north gate should retire through the south gate, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span>. Hengstenberg thinks the reason for this regulation "cannot be sought in the endeavor to avoid a throng," since "in that case it must have been ordained that all should go in by the same gate and go out by the opposite one;" it must, he holds, have been "a theological one," viz. "to signify that each should go out of the sanctuary another man than he came in."

The presentation of these sacrifices was not to be the special duty of the prince, but should devolve upon the community as a whole, who are now addressed as "thou" (vers. 13, 14) and "they" (ver. 15), and who should act in its fulfillment through their priests.

To this, however, Kliefoth objects that the conception of deriving ceremonial sanctity from contact with such offerings is completely strange to the Old Testament (see <a href="../../par/haggai/2-12.htm">Haggai 2:12</a>), and accordingly he connects the words.

Res.,' 1:402). That Ezekiel's river broadened and deepened so suddenly, and apparently without receiving into it any tributaries, clearly pointed to miraculous action. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-6.htm">Ezekiel 47:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen <i>this</i>?

The difficulty lying in the word "return" has given rise to a variety of conjectures. Hengstenberg supposes the prophet had made trial of the river's depth by wading in (perhaps up to the neck), and that the angel caused him to return from the stream to the bank According to Hitzig, the measuring had taken place at some distance from the stream, and the prophet, having come up to his guide from the bank after making trial of the water's depth, was Once more conducted back to the river's brink. Havernick conceives the sense to be that the prophet, having accompanied the angel to the point where the stream debouched into the Dead Sea was led back to the riverbank. All difficulty, however, vanishes if, either with Schroder we refer <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> to a mental returning, as if the import were that the angel, having ascertained that the prophet had "seen" the river's course, now told him to direct his attention to the bank, or, with Keil and Kliefoth, translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> by "along" or "on" rather than "to." As the prophet had been led along or on the river's bank to see the increasing breadth and depth of the water, so was he now "caused to return" along or on the same bank to note the abundance of the foliage with which it was adorned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-7.htm">Ezekiel 47:7</a></div><div class="verse">Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river <i>were</i> very many trees on the one side and on the other.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when I had returned</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> is by the best interpreters, after Gesenius ('Hebrew Grammar,' &sect; 132. 2), regarded as an incorrect form for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in my returning</span>), though Schroder adheres to the transitive sense of the verb, and translates," when I had turned myself," and Hitzig takes the suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as a genitive of possession, and renders, "when he came back with me." In any case, on the return journey the prophet observed that at (or, on) <span class="cmt_word">the bank</span> (or, <span class="accented">lip</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> Hitzig supposes the trees had not been there when the prophet made the down journey, but sprang up when he had turned to his guide (ver. 6), and stood with his back to the river. Kliefoth's conclusion is better, that the trees had been there all the while, but that the prophet's attention had not been directed to them. The luxuriant foliage of this vision reappears in that of the Apocalyptic river (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>).

The Arabah signified the low, sterile valley into which the Jordan runs near Jericho, in which are the Dead Sea (hence called "the sea of the Arabah," <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>), and the brook Kedron, or "river of the Arabah" (<a href="../../par/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>), and which extends as far south as the head of the Elanitic gulf. The whole region is described by Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:596) as one of extreme desolation - a character which belonged to it in ancient times (Josephus, 'Wars,' 3:10. 7; 4:8. 2). The part of this Arabah into which the waters flowed was situated north of <span class="cmt_word">the sea</span>, clearly not the Mediterranean, but the Dead Sea, "the sea of the Arabah," as above stated, and the "eastern sea" as afterwards named (ver. 18), into which they ultimately flowed. The clause, which being <span class="cmt_word">brought forth into the sea</span>, may either be connected with the proceeding words or formed into an independent sentence. Among those who adopt the former construction a variety of renderings prevails. The LXX. reads, "(And the water) comes to the sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), to the sea of the pouring out," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Dead Sea, into which the river debouches. With this Havernick agrees, rendering, "to the sea of that outflow." Ewald reads, "into the sea of muddy waters," meaning the Dead Sea.

Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Keil, and Currey, who adopt the latter construction, borrow <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> from the antecedent clause, and translate, "To the sea (come or go) the waters that have been brought forth;" with which accords the Revised Version.

Yon Raumer (p. 61) writes, "The sea is celled Dead, because there is in it no green plant, no water-fowl in it, no fish, no shell. If the Jordan carry fish into it, they die." "According to the testimony of all antiquity and of most modern travelers," says Robinson ('Bibl.

We perceived no sign of life within the waters."

The meaning cannot be that everything which liveth and swarmeth in the sea whither the rivers come shall live, because the Dead Sea contains no fish (see above), but whithersoever the rivers come, there living and swarming creatures of every kind shall spring into existence, shall come to life and flourish. The dual form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, has been accounted for by Maurer, as having been selected on account of its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>; by H&auml;vernick and Currey, as pointing to the junction of another river, the Kedron (H&auml;vernick), the Jordan (Currey), with the temple-stream before the latter, should fall into the sea; by Kliefoth, as alluding to a division of the river waters after entering the sea; by Neumann and Schroder, as referring to the waters of the sea and the waters of the river, which should henceforth be united; and by Hengstenberg, with whom Keil and Plumptre agree, as a dual of intensification (as in Jeremiah 1:21), signifying "double river," with allusion to its greatness, or the strength of its current. None of these interpretations is free from objection; though probably, in default of better, the last is best. Ewald changes the dual into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, a singular with a suffix, while Hitzig makes of it a plural; but neither of these devices is satisfactory.

Res.,' 2:225). These, according to the prophet, should not be healed (better than, "and that which shall not be healed," as in the margin of the Authorized Text), obviously because the waters of the temple-river should not reach them, but should be <span class="cmt_word">given to salt</span>. When the waters of the above-mentioned pools have been dried up or evaporated, they leave behind them a deposit of salt (see Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.,' 2:226), and Canon Driver ('Literature of the Old Testament,' p. 276), following Smend, conceives that the above-named miry places and marshes in the vicinity of the Dead Sea were to be allowed to remain as they were on account of the excellent salt which they furnished. (On the supposed (!) excellence of the salt derived from the Dead Sea, Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 616, may be consulted.) If this, however, were the correct import of the prophet's words, then the clause would describe an additional blessing to be enjoyed by the land, viz. that the temple-river would not be permitted to spoil its "salt-pans;" but the manifest intention of the prophet was to indicate a limitation to the life-giving influence of the river, and to signify that places and persons unvisited by its healing stream would be abandoned to incurable destruction. "To give to salt" is in Scripture never expressive of blessing, but always of judgment (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9-47.htm">Judges 9:47</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-6.htm">Jeremiah 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>).

Originally colonized by the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>), it became in David's time a flourishing kingdom under Toi, who formed an alliance with the Hebrew sore-reign against Hadadezer of Zoba (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-9.htm">1 Chronicles 18:9</a>).

(On the import of Hatticon, see <a href="../../par/exodus/26-28.htm">Exodus 26:28</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>, in both of which places it signifies "the middle.") The word Hazar (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), "an enclosure," or "place fenced off," was employed to denote villages or townships, of which at least six are mentioned in Scripture (see Gesenius, 'Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub voce</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Hauran</span>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (LXX.), "Cave-land," so called because of the number of its caverns, was most likely designed to designate "the whole tract of land between Damascus and the country of Gilead" (Keil).

Compared with the ancient north boundary of Canaan (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-7.htm">Numbers 34:7-9</a>), this appointed by Ezekiel's Torah for the new land shows a marked correspondence.

In any case, by this instruction, first the land of Israel was defined as the territory lying west of the Jordan, and secondly its boundary should extend from the last-named north border at its easternmost point, Hazar-enan, down the Jordan valley to the Dead Sea. The practical effect of this would be to cut off the lands which in the earlier division (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-14.htm">Numbers 34:14, 15</a>) had been assigned to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Otherwise the boundary here given corresponds with that traced in Numbers, though the latter is more minute. Hengstenberg, however, thinks the prophet cannot have intended to assert that the new Israel should not possess the land of Gilead as a frontier in the future as formerly, as in that case he would have been at variance, not only with preexisting Scripture (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/60-7.htm">Psalm 60:7</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/7-14.htm">Micah 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-19.htm">Jeremiah 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/10-10.htm">Zechariah 10:10</a>), but with subsequent history.

Different from Hazezon-Tamar, or Engedi (ver. 10; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-2.htm">2 Chronicles 20:2</a>), which lay too far up the west side of the sea, Tamar can hardly be identified either with the <span class="accented">Tamar</span> of <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> near Tadmor in the wilderness, or with the <span class="accented">Thamara</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) of Eusebius between Hebron and Elath, supposed by Robinson ('Bibl.

Proceeding westward, the southern boundary should reach to <span class="cmt_word">the waters of strife in Kadesh</span>; better, to the <span class="accented">waters of Meribotk Kadesh</span>. These were in the Desert of Sin, near Kadesh-Barnea (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>), which, again, was on the road from Hebron to Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). The exact site, however, of Kadesh-Barnea is matter of dispute; Rowland and Keil find it in the spring '<span class="accented">Ain Kades</span>, at the north-west corner of the mountain-land of Azazimeh, which stretches on the south of Palestine from the south-south-west to the north-north-east, and forms the watershed Between the Mediterranean and the Arabah valley. Delitzsch and Conder seek it in the neighborhood of the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Jemen</span>, on the south-east side of the above watershed, and on the road from Mount Hot. Robinson ('Bibl.

"Kades") pleads for a site on the west side of the Azazimeh plateau, and in the vicinity of the road by Shur to Egypt. Leaving Kadesh, the boundary should continue to <span class="cmt_word">the river</span>, or, <span class="accented">brook</span>, of Egypt, and thence extend to <span class="cmt_word">the great sea</span>, or Mediterranean.

But if the priest-code was later than Ezekiel, why should it have receded from the freer and more liberal spirit of Ezekiel? If progressive development can determine the relative ages of two documents, then Ezekiel, which accords equal rights to Jew and Gentile in the new Israel, and thus anticipates that breaking down of the middle wall of partition which has taken place under the gospel (<a href="../../par/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8-14, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>), should be posterior to the priest-code, which shows itself to be not yet emancipated from the trammels of Jewish exclusivism. At the same time, Ezekiel's Torah does not grant equal rights with native-born Israelites to "strangers" indiscriminately, or only to those of them who should have families, as Hitzig suggests, in reward for their increasing the population, but to such of them as should permanently settle in the midst of Israel, and show this by begetting children, and in this manner "building houses" for themselves. Kliefoth justly cautions against concluding from the prophet's statement that the time in which the prophet's vision realizes itself will necessarily be one in which marrying and begetting children will take place; and with equal justice points out that the number of Israel, especially when swelled up by an influx of Gentiles, will be so great (comp. ver. 10) as to render their settlement within the narrow boundaries of the land an impossibility - in this circumstance finding another indication that the prophet's language was intended to be symbolically, not literally, interpreted. <span class="cmt_word">NOTE</span>. <span class="accented">- On the boundaries of the land</span>.

Then, as this applies equally to all the tribe-portions, Hengstenberg regards "to him" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>) as pointing to "the whole of the tribes combined into an ideal unity," but expositors generally agree that "to him" should be referred to Dan, whom the prophet had in mind and was about to mention. <span class="cmt_word">A</span> portion for <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span> should be <span class="accented">Dan one</span> "portion," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), rather than "tribe," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span>, as Smend proposes. To take <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span> as alluding to the enumeration of the tribes is indeed countenanced by Ezekiel's mode of numbering the gates (vers. 30-35); but Ezekiel's style in vers. 30-35 will be preserved here also if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> precede "Judah," thus: "the portion of Danone." "The presupposition that one tribe should receive exactly as much as another led to the individual tribe's portion being considered as a <span class="accented">mona</span>s" (Kliefoth). In the first division of the land, Dan's portion was small, and situated west of the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin.

Havernick, after Gesenius, thinks of the workmen who should be employed in building the city, against which may be urged that the city is supposed to be already built. Hengstenberg, with whom Plumptre seems disposed to agree, can only see in the city servers "a militia who take the city in the midst." Keil and Kliefoth find them in the laboring classes, who should not in this future state, as so often in ordinary states among men, be destitute of a possession in land, but should receive an allotment for their maintenance. But an obvious objection to this view is that it hands over the city land exclusively to the laboring classes, <span class="accented">forgetting</span> that the "other" classes require support as well as they. Probably the best interpretation is to regard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "them that serve the city," as standing in antithesis to the other two classes already mentioned - the Levites, whose office should be to serve the tabernacle (see <a href="../../par/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-6.htm">Numbers 18:6</a>, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> is employed to denote the service of the Levites); and the priests, whose special function should be to serve the altar (see <a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7</a>, in which, again, the same verb is used). Thus regarded, "they that serve the city" will mean all engaged in secular pursuits in the city, which approximates to the view of Hitzig; and the prophet's language will signify that all such should derive their sustenance from the city lands, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> should either have direct access to these lands to cultivate them for themselves, or should obtain a share in the produce of these lands for other services rendered to the city. With this accords the further statement that those who served the city should serve it <span class="cmt_word">out of all the tribes of Israel</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> its inhabitants should not, as formerly, be drawn chiefly from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, but contain representatives from all the tribes of Israel (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/45-6.htm">Ezekiel 45:6</a>).

Added together, they should form a square <span class="cmt_word">of five and twenty thousand</span> reeds. Hence it is added in the second clause, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall offer the holy oblation four square, with the possession of the city.</span> Hitzig, Kliefoth, and Keil translate, "To a fourth part shall ye lift off the holy terumah for a possession of the city," as if the sense were that the area of the city possession should be a fourth part of the area of the whole tern-mall. That 5000 of breadth is a fourth part of 20,000 of breadth may be admitted; but that the city portion was not in area a fourth of the other two, a little arithmetic will show - the area of the whole terumah being 25,000 &times; 25,000 reeds   =   625,000,000 square reeds, and that of the city possession being 5000 &times; 25,000 reeds   =   125,000,000 square reeds.

This residue should consist of two strips of land, situated one on each side of the holy oblation (here, of the priests and Levites) and of the possession of the city, and running along the whole length of the five and twenty thousand of the oblation (here the three portions composing the square), and extending eastward to the Jordan and westward to the Mediterranean. The last two clauses of ver. 21, which should read, And the holy <span class="accented">oblation and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it</span>, implies that the two parts of the prince's portion, the eastern and the western, should be equal. Ver. 22 teaches that the whole intermediate territory between the border of Judah (in the north of the terumah) and the border of Benjamin (in the south of the terumah), from the possession of the Levites (the north portion of the terumah) and from (equivalent to "to") the possession of the city (the southern portion of the terumah), should belong to the prince. The mention of the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city as the extreme portions of the terumah, appears to indicate that the priests' portion lay between. Ewald translates as if the prophet meant to say the sanctuary should lie between the possession of the Levites and the possession of the city (in the first place), and between the two parts of the prince's land (in the second place), and yet again between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin (in the third place): but to read thus the text <span class="accented">must be</span> changed.

Each tribe should receive, as those north of the terumah, one portion. The exact extent of this equal portion, though not stated, may be calculated - Latitude of entrance to Hamath 34&deg; 20' Latitude of Kadesh (say)           30&deg; 30'                                                    3&deg; 50' 60 &times; 3 5/6  -  230 geographical miles. But the whole breadth of the terumah was 25,000 reeds   =   37 geographical miles. Hence 230  -  37 - 193 miles, which, divided by 12, gives 16 miles of breadth (from north to south) for each portion. The precise length from east to west is more difficult to estimate, in consequence of the varying widths of the land. Accepting this, however, as 55 miles at Jerusalem, the breadth of the prince's portion from east to west would be only 2&frac12; miles on each side of the terumah; which, multiplied by 50 miles from north to south, would yield an area of 125 square miles on each side, or of 250 square miles in all. The disposition of the southern tribes differs from that made under the earlier division of the land - Simeon alone lying where he had been formerly placed, in the south quarter, Issachar and Zebulun being fetched from the north, Benjamin from the middle, and Gad from the west to keep him company. Upon the whole, the new arrangement has several marked peculiarities which distinguish it from the old. While agreeing with the old in this, that the three tribes, Dan, Asher, and Naphtali retain their original places in the north, and the temple is not deprived of its central position between Judah and Benjamin, it differs from the old in placing the three northern tribes side by side from west to east, but after one another from north to south, and exchanges the positions of Benjamin and Judah, transferring the former to the south and the latter to the north of the temple and the city. Then, while under the old neither priests, Levites, nor prince had a portion, all three obtain one in this. And, finally, while under the old no regard was had to the temple, in the new this forms the central point of the whole.

The siege of Jerusalem in spite of Zedekiab's Egyptian alliance, was a thing decreed. Four years before it came - we are now between the fourth month of the fifth year (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>) and the sixth month of the sixth year (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-1.htm">Ezekiel 8:1</a>) of Zedekiah. and the siege began in the ninth year (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>) - Ezekiel, on the segnius irritant principle, brought it, as here narrated, before the eyes of the exiles. That he did so implies a certain artistic culture, in possessing which he stands alone, so far as we know, among the prophets of Israel, and to which his residence in the land of the Chaldees may have contributed. He takes a tile, or tablet of baked clay, such as were used in Babylon and Assyria for private contracts, historical inscriptions, astronomical observations (Pliny, 'Hist. Nat.,' 7:57), and the like, which were, in fact, the books of that place and time, and of which whole libraries have been brought to light in recent excavations (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' ch. 22) and engraves upon it the outlines of "a city" (Revised Version), in which the exiles would at once recognize the city of their fathers, the towers which they had once counted (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12</a>), the temple which had been their glory and their joy. Bricks with such scenes on them were found among the ruins of Nimroud, now in the British Museum (Layard, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>, ch. 7, p. 167). It is not difficult to picture to ourselves the wondering curiosity with which Ezekiel's neighbours would watch the strange proceeding. In this case the sign would be more impressive than any spoken utterance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set <i>battering</i> rams against it round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lay siege against it,</span> etc. The wonder would increase as the spectators looked on what followed. Either tracing the scene on the tablet, or, more probably, as ver. 3 seems to indicate, constructing a model of the scene, the prophet brings before their eyes all the familiar details of a siege, such as we see on numerous Assyrian bas-reliefs: such also as the narratives of the Old Testament bring before us. There are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the forts (as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>;  <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-4.htm">Jeremiah 52:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-8.htm">Ezekiel 26:8</a>), or, perhaps, the wall of circumvallation, which the besiegers erected that they might carry on their operations in safety; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> then the mount, or mound (the English of the Authorized Version does not distinguish between the two) of earth from which they plied the bows or catapults (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-24.htm">Jeremiah 32:24</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-4.htm">Jeremiah 33:4</a>; Ezekiel, <span class="accented">ut supra</span>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">camps</span> (plural in the Hebrew and Revised Version), or encampments, in which they were stationed in various positions found the city; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the <span class="cmt_word">battering rams</span>. Here the history both of the word and the thing has a special interest. The primary meaning of the Hebrew word is "lamb" (so in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>., Revised Version), or, better, "full grown wethers or rams" (Furst). Like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 7:4. 1; 2 Macc. 12:15), and the Latin <span class="accented">aries</span> (Livy, 21:12; 31:32, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), it was transferred to the engine which was used to "butt," like a ram, against the walls of a besieged city, and which, in Roman warfare, commonly terminated in a ram's head in bronze or iron. Ezekiel is the only Old Testament writer who, here and in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>, uses the word, for which the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate <span class="accented">arietes.</span> The margin of the Authorized Version in both places gives "chief leaders," taking "rams" in another figurative sense; but, in the face of the LXX. and Vulgate, there is no reason for accepting this. Battering rams frequently appear in Assyrian bas-reliefs of a much earlier date than Ezekiel's time, at Nimroud (Vaux, 'Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 456), Konyunyik (Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' p. 14:0, and elsewhere. They were hung by chains near the bottom of the besiegers' towers, and were propelled against the walls. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it <i>for</i> a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it.

Such a pan, like the Scotch "girdle," or our "gridiron," may well have formed part of the furniture of the prophet's house when it was taken for this strange use. It was to represent the kind of shield or fence set up on the ground, from behind which the besiegers discharged their arrows. Such shields are seen, like the battering rams, in Assyrian bas-reliefs (Layard, 'Nineveh,' etc., 2:345). Other interpretations, which see in it the symbol of the circumvallation of the city, or of the impenetrable barrier which the sins of the people had set up between themselves and Jehovah, or of the prophet himself as strong and unyielding (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>), do not commend themselves. The flat plate did not go round the city, and the spiritual meaning is out of harmony with the context. <span class="cmt_word">This shall be a sign,</span> etc. (comp. like forms in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25, 27</a>). The exiles of Tel-Abib, who wore the only spectators of the prophet's acts, are taken as representatives of "the house of Israel," that phrase being commonly used by Ezekiel, unless, as in vers. 5, 6, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16</a>, there is a special reason for noting a distinction for Jonah as representing the whole nation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lie thou also upon thy</span> <span class="cmt_word">left</span> <span class="cmt_word">side,</span> etc. We find the explanation of the attitude in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>. Samaria was on the "left hand," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the north, as a man looked to the east. So the same word <span class="accented">yamin</span> is both "the south" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/84-12.htm">Psalm 84:12</a>) and "the right hand." Here, accordingly, the "house of Israel" is taken in its specific sense, as the northern kingdom as distinguished from the "house of Judah" in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt bear their iniquity;</span> <span class="accented">ie.</span>, as in all similar passages (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-43.htm">Exodus 28:43</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-18.htm">Leviticus 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.), the punishment of their iniquity. The words so taken will help us to understand the numerical symbolism of the words that followed. The prophet was by this act to identify himself with both divisions of the nation, by representing in this strange form at once the severity and the limits of their punishment. I adopt, without any hesitation, the view that we have here the record of a fact, and not of a vision narrated. The object of the act was to startle men and make them wonder. As week after week went on this, <span class="accented">exceptis excipiendis</span>, was to be Ezekiel's permanent attitude, as of one crushed to the very ground, prostrate under the burden thus laid upon him, as impersonating his people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5</a></div><div class="verse">For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three hundred and ninety days,</span> etc. The days, as stated in ver. 6, stand for years according to the symbolism (with which Ezekiel was probably acquainted) of <a href="../../par/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>. How we are to explain the precise number chosen is a problem winch has much exercised the minds of interpreters. I will begin by stating what seems to me the most tenable solution. In doing this I follow Smend and Cornill in taking the LXX. as giving the original reading, and the Hebrew as a later correction, made with a purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Jerome and Origen bear witness to the fact that most copies of the former gave 190 years, some 150 and others, agreeing with the Hebrew, 390. The first of these numbers fits in with the thought that Ezekiel's act was to represent the period of the punishment of the northern kingdom. That punishment starts from the first captivity under Pekah about  <span class="date">B.C. 734</span>. Reckoning from that date, the 190 years bring us to about  <span class="date">B.C. 544</span>. The  punishment of Judah, in like manner, dates from the destruction of Jerusalem in  <span class="date">B.C. 586</span>, and the forty years bring us to  <span class="date">B.C. 546</span>, a date so near the other, that, in the round numbers which Ezekiel uses, they may be taken as practically coinciding. It was to that date that the prophet, perhaps, unacquainted with Jeremiah's seventy years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>), with a different starting point ( <span class="date">B.C. 600</span>) and <span class="accented">terminus</span> ( <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>), looked forward as the starting point of the restoration of Israel. It is obvious that Ezekiel contemplated the contemporaneous restoration of Israel and Judah (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-53.htm">Ezekiel 16:53-55</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-19.htm">Ezekiel 37:19-22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>), as indeed Isaiah also seems to do (Isaiah 11:13, 14), and Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:6, 12, 27). The teaching of Ezekiel's acts, then, had two distinct purposes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> It taught the certainty of the punishment. No plots, or rebellions, or alliances with Egypt, could avert the doom of exile from these who should survive the siege of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> It taught the exiles to accept their punishment with patience, but with hope. There was a limit, and that not very far off, which some of them might live to see, and beyond which there lay the hope of a restoration for both Israel and Judah. If that hope was not realized to the extent which Ezekiel's language impiles, the same may be, said of the language of <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40-66</a>, whether we refer those chapters to Isaiah himself or to the "great unknown" who followed Ezekiel, and may have listened to his teaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Still keeping to the idea of the years of punishment, but taking the Hebrew text, the combination of 390 and 40 gives 430, and this, it is urged, was the number assigned in <a href="../../par/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a> for the years of the sojourning in Egypt. Then the nation had been one, now it is divided. And the punishment of its two divisions is apportioned according to their respective guilt. For Israel, whose sins had been of a deeper dye, there was to be, as it were, another Egyptian bondage (<a href="../../par/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a> and Hosea 9:3 seem to predict a literal return to Egypt, but <a href="../../par/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a> shows it to have been figurative only). For Judah there was to be another quasi-wandering in the wilderness for forty years a period of punishment, but also of preparation lot a re-entry into the land of promise (Currey, Gardiner). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> A somewhat fanciful variation on the preceding view connects the 390 days with the forty stripes of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-3.htm">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>, reduced by Jewish preachers to "forty stripes save one" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>). Thus thirty-nine were assigned to each of the ten tribes, leaving forty for Judah standing by itself. With this addition <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> merges into <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2).</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The traditional Jewish interpretation, on the other hand (Kimchi), sees in the number of the years the measure, not of the punishment, but of the guilt of Israel and Judah respectively. That of the former is measured (as in the margin of the Authorized Version) from the revolt of the ten tribes ( <span class="date">B.C. 975</span>) to the time at which Ezekiel received the commands with which we are now dealing ( <span class="date">B.C. 595</span>). This computation gives, it is true, only 380 years; but the prophet may be thought of as dealing with round numbers, the 390 being, perhaps, chosen for the reason indicated in (3), or as reckoning with a different chronology. The forty years of the guilt of Judah are, on this view, reckoned from Josiah's reformation ( <span class="date">B.C. 624</span>), which would bring us to  <span class="date">B.C. 585-4</span>. And the sin of Judah is thought of as consisting specially in its resistance to that reformation and its rapid relapse into an apostasy like that of Ahaz or Manasseh. It can hardly be said that this is a satisfactory explanation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> Yet another view has been suggested, <span class="accented">sc.</span> that the siege of Jerusalem lasted, in round numbers, for 430 days - a day for each year of the national guilt as measured in the last hypothesis. Against this there is the fact that, according to the statements in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1-3</a>, the siege lasted for much more than the 430 days, <span class="accented">sc.</span> for nearly a year and a half. The conclusion to which I am led, after examining the several hypotheses, is, as I have sail, in favour of (1). The text of the Hebrew, as we find it, may have risen out of the tinct that the ten tribes had not returned as a body, and that there was no sign of their return, when Judah returned in  <span class="date">B.C. 536</span>, and therefore a larger number was inserted to allow time for a more adequate interval. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Each day for a year.</span> The Hebrew formula is that of iteration - "a day for a year, a day for a year." It originates, as has been said, in <a href="../../par/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>. What has been known as the year-day theory of prophetic interpretation flows naturally from it, and has been applied <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the "seventy weeks" of <a href="../../par/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24-27</a>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the twelve hundred and sixty and the three days and a half of <a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3, 9</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-7.htm">Ezekiel 4:7</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm <i>shall be</i> uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine arm shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">uncovered.</span> This, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/52-10.htm">Isaiah 52:10</a>, was the symbol of energetic action. The prophet was to be, as it were, no apathetic spectator of the siege which he was thus dramatizing, but is as the representative of the Divine commission to control and guide it. The picture of the prophet's attitude, not merely resting on his side and folding his hands, as a man at ease might do, but looking intently, with bare outstretched arm, at the scene portrayed by him, must, we may well imagine, have added to the startling effect of the whole procedure. We note the phrase, "set thy face," as specially characteristic of Ezekiel  (here, and, though the Hebrew verb is not the same, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-8.htm">Ezekiel 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-7.htm">Ezekiel 15:7</a>). The words "prophesy against it" may imply some spoken utterance of the nature of a "woe," like that of the son of Ananus (see above), but hardly, I think, a prolonged address. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-8.htm">Ezekiel 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will lay bands upon thee</span>, etc. The words point to the supernatural constraint which would support the prophet in a position as trying as that of an Indian yogi or a Stylite monk. He would himself be powerless to move (<span class="accented">exceptis excipiendis, as</span> before) from the prescribed position. There is, perhaps, a reference to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-25.htm">Ezekiel 3:25</a>. The people would have "put bands" upon the prophet to hinder his work; Jehovah will "put bands" upon him to help, nay, to constrain, him to finish it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, <i>according</i> to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thou also unto thee,</span> etc. The act implies, as I have said, that there were exceptions to the generally immovable attitude. The symbolism seems to have a twofold meaning. We can scarcely exclude a reference to the famine which accompanied the siege. On the other hand, one special feature of it is distinctly referred, not to the siege, but to the exile (ver. 13). Starting with the former, the prophet is told to make bread, not of <span class="cmt_word">wheat</span>, the common food of the wealthier class (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-14.htm">Psalm 147:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-8.htm">Jeremiah 41:8</a>), nor of <span class="cmt_word">barley</span>, the chief food of the poor (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>), but of these mixed with <span class="cmt_word">beans</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>), <span class="cmt_word">lentils</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-34.htm">Genesis 25:34</a>) - then, as now, largely used in Egypt and other Eastern countries - <span class="cmt_word">millet</span> (the Hebrew word is not found elsewhere), and <span class="cmt_word">fitches</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> vetches (here also the Hebrew word is found only in this passage, that so translated in <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-25.htm">Isaiah 28:25-27</a> standing, it is said, for the seed of the black cummin). The outcome of this mixture would be a coarse, unpalatable bread, not unlike that to which the population of Paris was reduced in the siege of 1870-71. This was to be the prophet's food, as it was to be that of the people of Jerusalem during the 390 days by which that siege was symbolically, though not numerically, represented. It is not improbable, looking to the prohibition against mixtures of any kind in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>, that it would be regarded as in itself unclean. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-10.htm">Ezekiel 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">And thy meat which thou shalt eat <i>shall be</i> by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy meat</span>, etc.; better, <span class="accented">food</span>, here and elsewhere. Coarse as the food was, the people would have but scanty rations of it. Men were not, as usual, to measure the corn, but to weigh the bread (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>). Taking the shekel at about 220 grains, the twenty shekels would be about 10 or 12 ounces. The common allowance in England for prison or pauper dietaries gives, I believe from 24 to 32 ounces, Besides other food. And this was to be taken, not as hunger prompted, but at the appointed hour. once a day. The whole scene of the people of the besieged city coming for their daily rations is brought vividly before us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-11.htm">Ezekiel 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sixth, part of an hin,</span> etc. According to the varying accounts of the "hin" given by Jewish writers, this would give from .6 to .9 of a pint. And this was, like the food, to be doled out once a day. Possibly "the bread of affliction and the water of affliction," in <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-20.htm">Isaiah 30:20</a>, contains a reference to the quantity as well as the quality of a prison dietary as thus described. Isaiah's words may refer to the siege of Sennacherib, as Ezekiel's do to the siege of Nebuchadnezzar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt eat it <i>as</i> barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shall bake it with dung</span>, etc. The process of baking in ashes was as old as the time of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>), and continues in Arabia and Syria to the present day. The kneaded dough was rolled into thin flat cakes, and they were placed upon, or hung over, the hot wood embers of the hearth or oven. But in a besieged city the supply of wood for fuel soon fails. The first resource is found, as still often happens in the East, in using the dried dung of camels or of cattle. Before Ezekiel's mind there came the vision of a yet more terrible necessity. That supply also might tail, and then men would be forced to use the dried contents of the "draught houses" or cesspools of Jerusalem. They would be compelled almost literally to fulfil the taunt of Rabshakeh (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a>). That thought, as bringing with it the ceremonial pollution of <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>: 7:21, was as revolting to Ezekiel as it is to us; but like Dante, in a like revolting symbolism ('Inf.,' 18:114), he does not shrink from naming it. It came to him, as with the authority of a Divine command, that he was even to do this, to represent the extreme horrors of the siege. And all this was to be done visibly, before the eyes of his neighbours at Tel-Abib. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-13.htm">Ezekiel 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even thus shall the children of Israel</span>, etc. The strange command takes a wider range. It symbolizes, not the literal horrors of the siege, but the "defiled bread" which even the exiles would be reduced to eat. So taken, the words remind us of the risk of eating unclean, food, which almost inevitably attended the position of the exiles (<a href="../../par/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>), and which, it may be, Ezekiel had already tell keenly. There is obviously something more than can be explained by a reference to "the bitter bread of banishment," or to Dante's "Come sa di sale... " ('Par.,' 17:58). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-14.htm">Ezekiel 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said I, Ah, Lord God!</span> etc. The formula is, curiously enough, equally  characteristic of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-8.htm">Ezekiel 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-49.htm">Ezekiel 20:49</a>) and of his teacher and contemporary (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-10.htm">Jeremiah 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>). The Vulgate represents it by <span class="accented">A, a, a</span>. His plea, which reminds us at once of <a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/10-14.htm">Acts 10:14</a>, is that he has kept himself free from all ceremonial pollution connected with food. And is he, a priest too, to do this? That be far from him! Anything but that! The kinds of defilement of which he speaks are noted in <a href="../../par/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-24.htm">Leviticus 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/11-39.htm">Leviticus 11:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/17-15.htm">Leviticus 17:15</a>. The "abominable things" may refer either to the unclean meats catalogued in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-3.htm">Deuteronomy 14:3-21</a> (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>), or as in the controversy of the apostolic age (<a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>), to eating <span class="accented">any</span> flesh that had been offered in sacrifice to idols. The prophet's passionate appeal is characteristic of the extent to which his character had been influenced by the newly discovered Law of the Lord (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>.), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably by the Book of Deuteronomy.

It served, at any rate, to represent, in some measure, the pressure of the siege. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The staff of bread</span>.

In <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a> the thought is the same, but the Hebrew word is different. <span class="cmt_word">They shall eat bread by weight,</span> etc. The phrase occurs, it may be noted, in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, one of the verses above referred to. The <span class="cmt_word">care</span> and <span class="cmt_word">astonishment</span>, implying that the wonted cheerfulness of meals would have departed, meet us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-19.htm">Ezekiel 12:19</a>.

To the wretchedness of physical privation there was to be added the consciousness of the sufferers that it was caused by their own evil deeds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/5.htm"><title>Ezekiel 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/4.htm" title="Ezekiel 4">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 5 <a href="../ezekiel/6.htm" title="Ezekiel 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber's rasor, and cause <i>it</i> to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard: then take thee balances to weigh, and divide the <i>hair</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take thee a barber's razor,</span> etc. The series of symbolic acts is carried further. Recollections of Isaiah and Leviticus mingle strangely in the prophet's mind. The former had made the "razor" the symbol of the devastation wrought by an invading army (<a href="../../par/isaiah/7-20.htm">Isaiah 7:20</a>). The latter had forbidden its use for the head and beard of the priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>). Once again Ezekiel is commanded to do a forbidden thing as a symbolic act. He is, for the moment, the representative of the people of Jerusalem, and there is to be, as of old, a great destruction of that people as "by a razor that is hired." The word for "barber" (perhaps "hair cutter") does not occur elsewhere in the Old Testament, but its use may be noted as showing that then, as now, the "barber" was a recognized institution in every Eastern town. The word for "knife" (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a>) is used in ver. 2, and commonly throughout the Old Testament, for "sword," and is so translated here by the LXX. and Vulgate. The prophet is to take a "sword" and use it as a razor, to make the symbolism more effective. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, <i>and</i> smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt burn with fire,</span> etc. The symbolism receives its interpretation in ver. 12. A third part of the people (we  need not expect numerical exactness) was to perish in the city of pestilence and famine, another to fall by the sword in their attempts to escape, yet another third was to be scattered to the far off land of their exile, and even there the sword was to follow them. The words, <span class="cmt_word">in the midst of the city,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the days of the siege</span>, find their most natural explanation in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1, 5, 6</a>.

They were, if saved at all, to be saved "so as by fire" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-15.htm">1 Corinthians 3:15</a>), to be as "brands plucked from the burning" (<a href="../../par/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/3-2.htm">Zechariah 3:2</a>). Isaiah's thought of the "remnant" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-16</a>) seems hardly to come in here. The whole utterance is one of denunciation. The act of "binding in the skirts" implies only a limited protection. Omit "for," and for "thereof" read "therefrom," <span class="accented">s.c.</span> from the fire (Revised Version). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-4.htm">Ezekiel 5:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; <i>for</i> thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</div><div class="comm">

The words that follow point to the central position of Jerusalem in the geography, and therefore in the history, of the ancient East: Egypt to the south, Assyria and Babylon to the north, and in the nearer distance Moabites and Ammonites, and Edomites, and Phoenicians, and Philistines; to all of these Jerusalem might have been as a city set on a hill, as the light of the Gentiles. That had been her ideal position from the first, as in the visions of <a href="../../par/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a> it was to be in its ideal future. The words are not without interest, as probably having suggested the thought, prominent in mediaeval geography (Dante, 'Inf.,' 34:115, and the Hereford 'Mappa Mundi'), that Jerusalem was physically the central point of the earth's surface. So Moslems believe Mecca to be the earth's centre, and the Greek word <span class="accented">omphalos</span> was applied to Delphi as implying the same belief

It is not (as stated by Currey and Gardiner) the verb rendered "rage" in <a href="../../par/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>. The former meaning fits in fairly here, hot some critics (Smend) suppose that the text is corrupt.

Some Hebrew manuscripts and some versions omit the negative, but this is probably a correction made in order to bring about a verbal agreement with <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-12.htm">Ezekiel 11:12</a>.

The words of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a> and <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a> imply that horrors such as these occurred during the siege of the city by the Chaldeans, as they had occurred before in the siege of Samaria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28, 29</a>), and were to occur afterwards in that by the Romans (Josephus, 'Bell Jud.,' 6:4. &sect; 4). <span class="cmt_word">The whole remnant,</span> etc. (comp. ver. 2).

This was, after all, the root evil of all other evils. Pollution of worship, the degradation of the highest element in man's nature, passed into pollution and degradation of his whole life. Even in our Lord's acted teaching, in <a href="../../par/john/2-15.htm">John 2:15, 16</a> and <a href="../../par/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>, we have the same principle implied. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore will I also diminish thee,</span> etc. The italics show that the last word is not in the Hebrew.

Most recent critics suggest conjectural  emendations of the text. I incline to rest satisfied with the Authorized Version, and to explain it by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The word implies not only the decrease, but the entire withdrawal of Jehovah's favour. Possibly there is an implied reference to the command of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>. Jerusalem had "diminished" from the Law of God, had, as it were, erased the commandments which were of supreme obligation, and therefore, as by a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, God would diminish her. <span class="cmt_word">Neither will I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have any pity</span>. The words are, of course, anthropomorphic, and have therefore to be received with the necessary limitations. As the earthly minister of justice must not yield to a weak pity which would be incompatible with the assertion of the eternal law of righteousness, so neither will the Supreme Judge. There is a time for all things, and justice must do its work first, in order that there may be room for pity afterwards. For other assertions, which seems strange to us, of trials unpitying character of God, see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-4.htm">Ezekiel 7:4, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-18.htm">Ezekiel 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-10.htm">Ezekiel 9:10</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-14.htm">Jeremiah 13:14</a>.

The strange symbolic act is now interpreted. <span class="cmt_word">I will draw out a sword</span>, etc. The phrase recurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, and is found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> - an echo, like so many other passages in Ezekiel, from what seems to have been his favourite storehouse of thought and language (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17.htm">Leviticus 17-26</a>.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a></div><div class="verse">Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i> in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will</span> <span class="cmt_word">cause my fury to rest upon them,</span> etc.; Revised Version, <span class="accented">I will satisfy</span>, etc. The phrase meets us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-42.htm">Ezekiel 16:42</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-17.htm">Ezekiel 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. To "rest" here is to "repose" rather than to "abide." The thought is that a righteous anger, like that of Jehovah, rests (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> is quieted) when it has done its work, and that in this sense God is "comforted," either as rejoicing in the punishment of evil for its own sake (as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>), or because the punishment does its work in leading men to repentance. Israel may be comforted, because God is comforted as he sees that his judgments have done their work, and that his wrath can find repose. <span class="cmt_word">Have spoken in my zeal</span>. The thought implied is that what is spoken in the earnest purpose of "zeal" will assuredly be carried into execution (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>). Men might deride the prophet's warning as an idle threat. It would prove itself to have come from God.

The phrase reminds us of <a href="../../par/lamentations/1-12.htm">Lamentations 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-15.htm">Lamentations 2:15</a>: and the latter was probably a conscious reproduction of it.

The accumulation of synonyms in both clauses of the verse is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel's style. Word follows word, like the strokes of a sledge hammer. The word for "instruction" is that which occurs so often in the Book of Proverbs (Proverbs 1:2, 3, and in twenty-two other passages). In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-14.htm">Jeremiah 30:14</a>, the Authorized Version renders it "chastisement," and that sense is manifestly implied here. Jerusalem was, as it were, to be the great object lesson in God's education of mankind. And the final stroke of all is that the words were not the prophet's own, but "I the Lord have spokes it." The words reappear in ver. 17.

It is noticable that, as in the symbolism of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-17</a>, the laminae is more prominent in Ezekiel's thoughts than the other punishments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a></div><div class="verse">So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Evil beasts</span>, etc. These appear in like connection in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>). They reappear in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15, 21</a>. Historically, we have an example of the suffering thus caused in the lions of <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25</a>, when towns and villages were deserted, and the unburied carcases of those who had died by famine, or pestilence, or the sword, were everywhere to attract them from afar. This was, of course, the natural and inevitable result. <span class="cmt_word">Pestilence</span> <span class="cmt_word">and blood,</span> etc. As this is followed by the work of the sword, "blood" probably points to some special form of plague, possibly dysentery (<a href="../../par/acts/28-8.htm">Acts 28:8</a>, Revised Version), or carbuncles, like Hezekiah's boil (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-21.htm">Isaiah 38:21</a>).

We have had it with a different verb in the Hebrew, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-3.htm">Ezekiel 4:3</a>. It will meet us again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-46.htm">Ezekiel 20:46</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/21-2.htm">Ezekiel 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-2.htm">Ezekiel 25:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-21.htm">Ezekiel 28:21</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2</a>. In this case it probably implied an outward act, like that of Daniel, when he, with a very different purpose, looked towards Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>). In contrast with the widespread plains of Mesopotamia in which Ezekiel found himself, this was the chief characteristic of the land which he had left. The mountains represent the whole country, including the rivers (Revised Version, here and throughout, renders the Hebrew "water courses," to distinguish it from the "river" (<span class="accented">nahar</span>) of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1, 3</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>, and the "river" (<span class="accented">nachal</span>) of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-5.htm">Ezekiel 47:5</a>. Its strict meaning is that of a "ravine" or "gorge," the <span class="accented">wady</span> of modern Arabic, through which a stream rushes in the winter, but is dried up in the summer). All the localities are named as having been alike polluted by the worship of idols For <span class="accented">mountains and hills</span> as the scenes of such worship, see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; for the ravines and valleys, <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a> (the Valley of Hinnom); and more generally, <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5, 6</a>. The same combination meets us in ch. 35:8; 36:5, 6. In his address to the mountains, Ezekiel follows in the footsteps of <a href="../../par/micah/6-2.htm">Micah 6:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I will destroy your high places.</span> The words point to the most persistent, though not the worst, of all the idolatries by which the worship of Jehovah as the God of Israel had been overshadowed. The words of Ezekiel are identical with those of Leo, 26:30. The Bamoth, or high places, of Baal, are mentioned in <a href="../../par/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a> and <a href="../../par/joshua/13-17.htm">Joshua 13:17</a>, and are probably identical with the high places of Arnon in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-28.htm">Numbers 21:28</a>. There they are named only incidentally, not in the way of prohibition or condemnation. So, in like manner, in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a> and Deuteronomy 33:29, if the technical sense exists at all, it is referred to only as included in the triumph of the worship of Jehovah over the hill fortresses as the sanctuaries of other gods. The absence of the word from the Book of Judges is difficult to explain, as it was precisely in that period of the history of Israel, irregular and unsettled, that we should have expected to find the people adopting the cultus of their neighbours. A probable solution of the problem is that, so long as the tabernacle and the ark were at Shiloh, that was so pre-eminently the centre of the worship of Jehovah, that the people were not tempted to forsake it, or to set up the worship upon the high places side by side with it. When, after the capture of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> ark, Shiloh was a deserted sanctuary, we meet for the first time with the worship of the high places, not as a thing forbidden, but as sanctioned by the presence of Samuel, as the judge and prophet of the people (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>), the "high place" in the last passage being, apparently, the same as "the hill of God." In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>, possibly from the Book of Jashar, we have the elder, less technical sense of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-12.htm">Deuteronomy 32:12</a> and Deuteronomy 33:19. It would seem, accordingly, as if Samuel had acted on a policy like that of the counsel which Gregory I gave Augustine. He found the worship of the high places adopted by the Israelites from the neighbouring nations. He sought to turn  them to the worship of Jehovah. So the writer of <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a> records the fact that "the people sacrificed in high places," because as yet, though the ark had been brought to Jerusalem, "there was no house built unto the Name of Jehovah until those days," and that Solomon himself also "sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places." At the chief of these, the great high place of Gibeon, Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings, and had the memorable vision in which he made choice of wisdom rather than length of days, or riches and honour, returning from it, as though the cultus of the two places stood nearly on an equal footing, to offer other burnt offerings before the ark of God at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-3.htm">1 Kings 3:3-15</a>). With the erection of the temple the state of things was, in some measure, altered, and the temple was the one legitimate sanctuary. When the ten tribes revolted under Jeroboam, they were, of course, cut off from the temple services, and the king accordingly, besides the calves at Bethel and Dan, set up high places, with priests not of the sons of Aaron, in the cities of Samaria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32</a>). From that time forward the high places are always mentioned by both historians and prophets in a tone of condemnation, whether they were in Israel or Judah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a>), but they had become so deeply rooted in the reverence of the people that even the better kings of Judah, who warred against open idolatry, like Asa (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>), Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>), Jehoash (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-3.htm">2 Kings 12:3</a>), Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-4.htm">2 Kings 14:4</a>), Azariah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>), left them undisturbed; while in the history of the northern kingdom the cultus of the Bamoth reigned paramount (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). It was not till Hezekiah, presumably under Isaiah's influence, removed the "high places" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>) that we find any serious attempt to put them down. They had been tolerated, apparently, because, as in Rabshakeh's taunt (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-22.htm">2 Kings 18:22</a>), they were nominally connected with the worship of Jehovah. Under the confluent polytheism of Manasseh they naturally reappeared (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>: <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3</a>). The reformation of Josiah was more thorough (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23.htm">2 Kings 23</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>), and was probably stimulated by Hilkiah and Huldah. The discovery of the book of the Law (probably Deuteronomy), with its condemnations of mountain sanctuaries, though, as we have seen, the Bamoth were not prohibited by name, roused the zeal of the prophets, especially of the priest prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and when the Bamoth-cultus revived, after the death of Josiah, the former was strong in his protests (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>, <span class="accented">et al</span>.), all the more so because now, as in the earlier stages of their history, they had become high places of Baal (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; 32:55), and were associated with abominations like those of the worship of Moloch in the Valley of Hinnom. So it was that Ezekiel, writing on the banks of the Chebar, is now led to place them in the forefront of the sins of his people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a></div><div class="verse">And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, <i>even</i> I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</div><div class="comm">

The <span class="accented">chammanim</span> were pillars or obelisks identified with the worship of Baal as the sun god, standing on his altars (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>), coupled with the "groves," or <span class="accented">Asherim</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/17-8.htm">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>), and with the "high places" in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-5.htm">2 Chronicles 14:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</span> As in the prophecy against Bethel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), and in Josiah's action (2 Kings 33:16), this was the <span class="accented">ne plus ultra</span> of desecration. Where throe had been the sweet savour of incense there should be the sickening odour of the carcases of the slain. The word for "idols" (<span class="accented">gillulim</span>), though found elsewhere, notably in Ezekiel's favourite textbooks (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>), is more prominent in his writings (where it occurs thirty-six times) then in any other book of the Old Testament, and means, primarily, a cairn or heap of stones, which, like the "sun images," came to be associated with Baal. Ezekiel repeats both words in ver. 6, with all the emphasis of scorn. He predicts the coming of a time when the work of destruction should be done more thoroughly than even Josiah lind done it. When that time came, the familiar formula, "Ye shall know that I am the Lord," should receive yet another fulfilment.

For these, at least, the punishment would, in greater or less measure, do its work; and, in remembering Jehovah, they would find the beginning of conversion.

The "whorish heart" of the people has made Jehovah himself "broken-hearted." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Most recent critics, however, follow the rendering of the Vulgate (<span class="accented">contrivi</span>), and take the verb, which is passive in form, as being like a Greek verb in the middle voice, transitive in form, with an implied reflex force. So we get, as in the margin of  the Revised Version, "I have broken their whorish heart." So taken, thought and words are both connected with <a href="../../par/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>, and the self-loathing that follows has its counterpart in <a href="../../par/job/42-6.htm">Job 42:6</a>. The thought is eminently characteristic of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-43.htm">Ezekiel 20:43</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-31.htm">Ezekiel 36:31</a>), and, we may add also, of Leviticus (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39-42</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-10.htm">Ezekiel 6:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD, <i>and that</i> I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have not said in vain,</span> etc. The thought of that self-loathing and repentance reconciles Ezekiel to his work. To "labour in vain" is the great misery of all workers for God. A time will come when he shall see that God has not sent him to such a work "in vain." What before was dark will be made clear unto him (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>). Ezekiel's words, "not in vain," are echoed frequently by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 58</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). The corresponding phrase, "I have broken their eyes," sounds strange to us; but, after all, the heart is not literally broken more than the eyes, and figuratively the same words may be applied to either, so that there is no need for supposing, with some critics, that a more appropriate verb has been dropped out. Eyes and heart were alike involved in the sin (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>), and both came under the same chastisement that was to lead them to repentance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Smite with thine hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smite with thine hand,</span> etc. The outward gestures were to give a dramatic emphasis to the mingled indignation and sorrow with which the prophet was to utter his woe.

Instances of its use for other feelings meet us in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-13.htm">Ezekiel 22:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a> (anger); <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-19.htm">Jeremiah 31:19</a> (shame).

None can escape the judgment. The word <span class="cmt_word">besieged</span> is the same as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>; but it may have the sense, as in <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, of "kept," or "preserved," for the worst evil of the three.

The "hills" and "mountains" were naturally the scenes of the worship of the "high places," and these were commonly associated with groves of trees, as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/57-5.htm">Isaiah 57:5</a>.

It meets us three times in Exodus, seventeen in Leviticus, seventeen in Numbers, and seldom elsewhere. The crowning sin, from the prophet's point of view, was that the incense which was due to Jehovah had been lavished on the false gods of the nations. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a></div><div class="verse">So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, yea, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">More desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath</span>; better, with the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">from the wilderness.</span> The name does not appear elsewhere, and has not been identified. Assuming the Authorized Version rendering, we must think of Ezekiel as naming, as Dante haines the Valdichiana ('Inf.,' 29:47), some specially horrible and desolate region. For such a region the name of Diblah (a cake of figs) does not seem appropriate. Taking the Revised Version translation ("from the wilderness toward Diblah"), we have a phrase analogous to "from Dan to Beersheba," as denoting the extent of the desolation. The "wilderness" is usually applied to the nomad region south of Palestine, and this would lead us to look for Diblah in the north, and so to look elsewhere than to the two places Beth-diblathaim (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>) and Almon-diblathaim (<a href="../../par/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>), both of which are in Moab. The difficulty was solved by Jerome by the conjectural emendation of Riblah, the two Hebrew letters for <span class="accented">d</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> being often written by copyists for each other. Riblah (it is a suggestive fact that the two chief manuscripts of the LXX. the Alexandrian and the Vatican, have <span class="accented">Deblatha</span>, or <span class="accented">Deblaa</span>, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>) was a fortified town on the north road from Palestine to Babylon, where the Babylonian kings used to take up their position during their invasions of the former. Within a short time after Ezekiel wrote this chapter, it became memorable in its connection with Zedekiah's sufferings (comp. <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6, 20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26</a>). Its probable site is fixed on the banks of the Orontes. The evidence, on the whole, is, I think, in favour of this interpretation. It is adopted by Ewald, Cornill, Smend, Gesenius, and most recent critics. An additional fact in its favour is that Hamath, in the same region, appears as an ideal northern boundary in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezekiel/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezekiel 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm"><title>Ezekiel 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/ezekiel/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/ezekiel/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/ezekiel/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/6.htm" title="Ezekiel 6">&#9668;</a> Ezekiel 7 <a href="../ezekiel/8.htm" title="Ezekiel 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-1.htm">Ezekiel 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - The absence of any fresh date, and the fact that it is simply tacked on to the previous chapter by the copulative conjunction, shows that what follows belongs to the same group. The use of the phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the word of the Lord came unto me,</span> shows, however, that there was an interval of silence, perhaps of meditation, followed by a fresh influx of inspiration; and, so far as we may judge from the more lyrical character of the chapter, a more intense emotion.

Stress is laid, and for the time laid exclusively, on the unpitying character of the Divine judgments. And this is followed as before, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, by "Ye shall know that I am the Lord." Fear must teach men the lesson which love had failed to teach.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-6.htm">Ezekiel 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">An end is come, the end is come: it watcheth for thee; behold, it is come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It watcheth for thee;</span> better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">it awaketh against thee.</span> So the LXX., Vulgate, Luther. The Hebrew presents a paronomasia between the noun and verb - <span class="accented">hakketz, hekitz</span> - which cannot be reproduced in English. The destined doom is thought of as rousing itself to its appointed work. The word is cognate with that rendered "awaketh" in <a href="../../par/psalms/78-65.htm">Psalm 78:65</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-7.htm">Ezekiel 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble <i>is</i> near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The morning is come unto thee,</span> etc. In the only other passage in which the Hebrew noun occurs (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-5.htm">Isaiah 28:5</a>), it is translated "diadem," the meaning being strictly a circular ornament. Here the LXX. gives <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f74;</span>, something twirled, out of which may come the meaning of the changes of fortune. Possibly, as in the familiar "wheel of fortune," that thought was involved in the circular form by itself. In the Tahnud it appears as the name of the goddess of fate at Ascalon (Furst). On the whole, I follow the Revised Version, Keil, and Ewald, in giving "thy doom." The "morning" of the Authorized Version probably rises from the thought that the dawn is, as it were, the glory and diadem of the day. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">contritio. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The day of trouble</span>; better, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">of tumult.</span> The word is specially used of the noise of war (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-3.htm">Zechariah 14:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Not the sounding again upon the mountains.</span> The first noun is not found in the Old Testament, but a closely allied form appears in <a href="../../par/isaiah/16-9.htm">Isaiah 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-33.htm">Jeremiah 48:33</a>, for the song of the vintage. Not that, the prophet says, shall be heard on the mountains, but in its place the cry of battle and the noise of war. The LXX. "not with travail-pangs," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">non gloriae montium</span>, show that the word was in both cases a puzzle to the translators. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense thee for all thine abominations.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - The verses repeat, like the burden of a lyric ode, but end more emphatically, <span class="cmt_word">ye shall know that I am Jehovah that smiteth.</span>

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a></div><div class="verse">Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is come</span>. Read, as before, <span class="accented">it cometh</span>; and for <span class="cmt_word">morning</span>, doom (see note on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">The rod hath blossomed</span>, etc. The three verbs imply a climax. The "doom" springs out of the earth; the rod of vengeance blossoms (the word is the same as that which describes the blooming of Aaron's rod (<a href="../../par/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>), and the phrase was probably suggested by the history); <span class="cmt_word">pride</span> (either that of the Chaldean ministers of vengeance, or of Israel as working out its own punishment; I incline to the latter) buds and bears fruit. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a> the word follows on "blossom," and therefore seems applicable to the formation of the fruit rather than the flower. (For the image of the rod, comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>; <a href="../../par/micah/6-9.htm">Micah 6:9</a>.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a></div><div class="verse">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them <i>shall remain</i>, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <i>shall there be</i> wailing for them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violence is risen up,</span> etc. The "violence" admits of the same twofold interpretation as the "pride" of ver. 10.  <span class="cmt_word">None of them shall remain.</span> The interpolated verb, though grammatically necessary, weakens the force of the Hebrew. "None of them; none of their multitude; none of their wealth." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> The noun is not found elsewhere. Taken, as the Authorized Version takes it, the thought, like that of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, is that the usual rites of burial would be neglected, and that there would be "no widows to make lamentation" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). The Revised Version "eminency" implies the loss of all that constituted greatness. Cornill and the LXX. ("beauty" or "gaiety") practically agree with this. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">requies</span>, and Furst "a gathering, or tumult of the people." Probably the text is corrupt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-12.htm">Ezekiel 7:12</a></div><div class="verse">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let not the buyer rejoice,</span> etc. We have to read, between the lines, the story of Ezekiel's companions in exile. They belonged, it will be remembered, to the nobler and wealthier class (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>). They, it would seem, had been compelled to sell their estates at a price which made the "buyer rejoice and the seller mourn." In each case the joy and the sorrow would be but transient. Wrath had gone out against the whole multitude. In <a href="../../par/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a> we have parallel instances of the advantage taken by the rich of the distress of the old tree holders. In the story of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-16</a> we have, though from a very different point of view, the history of a like purchase, while the city was actually surrounded by the Chaldeans. The neglect of the sabbatic year (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-17</a>) makes it probable that the jubilee year also (if, indeed, it had ever been more than an ideal) had fallen into desuetude, and that the buyers comforted themselves with the thought that the land they had got, on cheap terms, weald belong to them and their children forever. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision <i>is</i> touching the whole multitude thereof, <i>which</i> shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the seller shall not return,</span> etc. At first the thought seems only to add to the sorrow of the seller. He is told that he, at least, shall not return to his old estate. Even though they should be alive at the year of jubilee, their exile had to last its appointed time, Ezekiel's forty (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>) and Jeremiah's seventy years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This, however, did not exclude the return of their children (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>), and in the mean time all private sorrow would fall into the background as compared with the great public woe of the destruction of the holy city. <span class="cmt_word">The vision is touching,</span> etc. The noun is used as a synonym for prophecy, as elsewhere (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of Ezekiel (seven times) and Daniel (eleven times). For the Authorized Version read with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">none shall return</span>, or better (with the Vulgate and Keil), <span class="accented">the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return, i.e.</span> shall go straight onward to do its work (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). So taken, there is a kind of play upon the iterated word: "The seller shall not turn his footsteps back, neither shall the prophecy." <span class="accented">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</span> shall be true of both. I take the other words, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">no man in the iniquity of his life shall strengthen himself</span>, noting the fact that the word for "strengthen" is that which enters into Ezekiel's name. It is as though he said, "God is the only true source of strength to thee, as thy very name bears witness." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath <i>is</i> upon all the multitude thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They have blown the trumpet.</span> The word for "trumpet" is not found elsewhere, but the corresponding verb is used continually in connection with the trumpet of war, and Ezekiel seems to have coined the corresponding substantive, not, perhaps, without a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>. There may possibly be an allusion to the trumpet blowing with which the jubilee year (see ver. 13) was ushered in. The trumpet should sound, not for each man's return to his own estate, but for the alarm of war. and even then the consciousness of guilt will hinder men from arming themselves for battle (comp. <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>).

They should be like the doves of the mountain gorges, that are fluttered at the appearance of the eagle or the fowler, and seem by note (<a href="../../par/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a>) and gesture (<a href="../../par/nahum/2-7.htm">Nahum 2:7</a>), to be mourning forevermore. There also they shall lie, every man in his iniquity, and wailing for its punishment. We are reminded of Dante's similitudes in 'Inf.,' 5:40, 46, 82.

The people turn in their distress to the three representativtes of wisdom - the prophet as the bearer of an immediate message from Jehovah, the priest as the interpreter of his Law (<a href="../../par/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>), the "ancients" or "elders" as those who had learnt the lessons of experience, - and all alike in vain. (For illustrative facts, see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-13.htm">Jeremiah 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-2.htm">Jeremiah 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/23-21.htm">Jeremiah 23:21-40</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-9.htm">Jeremiah 27:9-18</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1-9</a>, and generally <a href="../../par/micah/3-6.htm">Micah 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-9.htm">Lamentations 2:9</a>.)

The action of Zedekiah in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/21-1.htm">Jeremiah 21:1</a> and Jeremiah 34:8 makes it probable enough that it was actually reproduced. A solemn litany procession like that of <a href="../../par/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13, 14</a> and Joel 2:15-17 would have been quite in keeping with his character. <span class="cmt_word">The prince shall clothe himself,</span> etc. The noun is specially characteristic of Ezekiel, who uses it thirty-four times. In ch. 12:12 the "prince" seems identified with the "king." Here it may mean either the heir to the throne, or the chief ruler under the king. <span class="cmt_word">The people of the land,</span> etc. The phrase is perhaps used, as the Jewish rabbis afterwards used it, with a certain touch of scorn, for the labouring class. All the upper class had been carried away captive with Jehoiachin (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>).

One year and one month had passed since the vision of Chebar, and had been occupied partly by the acted, partly by the spoken, prophecies of the preceding chapters. In the mean time, things had gone from bad to worse in Jerusalem. In the absence of the higher priests, idolatry was more rampant, and had found its way even into the temple. It is probable that tidings of this had reached Ezekiel, as we know that frequent communications passed between the exiles and those they had left behind (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1-3, 9, 25</a>). Directly or indirectly, Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Genesisariah the son of Hilkiah. may have conveyed a message, orally or written, from Jeremiah himself. Some such report may have led to the visit from the <span class="cmt_word">elders of Judah,</span> if we understand by that term the exiles of Tel-Abib. I venture, however, on the conjecture that possibly those who came to the prophet were actually visitors who had come from Judah. Elsewhere, as in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-1.htm">Ezekiel 14:1</a> and Ezekiel 20:1, those who thus came are described as "elders of Israel," or the captives (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>), "they of the Captivity" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/3-15.htm">Ezekiel 3:15</a>). In either case, the visions that follow gain a special significance. The prophet becomes the seer. It is given to him to know, in a manner which finds a spurious analogue in the alleged mental travelling of the clairvoyant of modern psychology, what is passing in the city from which the messengers had come - and to show that he knows it. With such facts before his eyes, what other answer can there be than that evil must  meet its doom? And so we pass into the second series of prophecies which ends with <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-23.htm">Ezekiel 13:23</a>. It would seem as if the enquirers had kept silent as well as the prophet. We are not told that they asked anything. His look and manner, perhaps also attitude and gesture, forbade utterance. The <span class="cmt_word">hand of the Lord</span> - the trance state - was in the act to fall on him (see notes on Ezekiel 3:14, 22). When the trance state was over, we may think of him as reporting and recording what he had thus seen in vision.. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld, and lo a likeness,</span> etc. The vision opens with a theophany like that of ch. 1; but here, as there, Ezekiel uses the word which emphasizes the fact that what he had seen was but a "likeness" of the ineffable glory, an image of the Unseen. (For "amber," see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 27</a>.) In this case we note the absence of the cherubic figures. It is simply the "appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah," seen now in the glow of fire, without the milder, more hopeful brightness of the rainbow (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where <i>was</i> the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The form of an hand</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/2-9.htm">Ezekiel 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a>). For the mode of transit, see Bel and the Dragon, ver. 36. as probably a direct imitation. The touch of the "hand" was followed by the action of the Spirit, in visions which he knew to be more than dreams, visions that came from God (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>). The word is not the same as that commonly used by Daniel (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), and often by Ezekiel himself (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22, 23</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), but <span class="accented">mareh</span>, which implies a more direct act of intuition. The word appears again in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-3.htm">Ezekiel 43:3</a>, and in <a href="../../par/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26, 27</a>, <span class="accented">et al. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To the door of the gate,</span> etc. From the first we trace the priest's familiarity with the structure of the temple. He is brought, as it were, after his journey in the spirit, <span class="cmt_word">to the door of the gate of the inner court that looketh towards the north</span> (Revised Version). This is identified in ver. 5 with the "gate of the altar." It may probably also be identified with the "upper gate" of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>; the "high gate" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>; the "higher gate" of <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-35.htm">2 Kings 15:35</a>, built by Jotham; the "new gate" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>. Obviously it was one of the most conspicuous portions of the temple, where the people gathered in large numbers. And here the prophet sees what he calls <span class="cmt_word">the image of jealousy</span>. The words that follow probably give his explanation of the strange phrase, not found elsewhere, though it might naturally be suggested by <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58</a>. What this image was we can only conjecture. The word for "image" is a rare one, and is found only here and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-7.htm">2 Chronicles 33:7, 15</a>. It may have been the Asherah (the "grove" of the Authorized Version), or conical stone, such as Manasseh had made and placed, with an altar dedicated to it, in the house of the Lord (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-3.htm">2 Chronicles 33:3</a>), or one of Baal, or of Ashtaroth, or even of Tammuz (see ver. 14). As the word "grove" does not occur in Ezekiel, it may be sufficient to state that the <span class="accented">Ashera</span> was a pillar symbolical either of a goddess of the same name, or, as some think, of the Phoenician Astarte. The worship seems to have first become popular under Jezebel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>), and took deep root both in Israel and Judah. The cultus, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>, seems to have been connected with the foulest licence, like that of the Babylonian Mylitta (Herod., 1:199; Baruch 6:43). The work of Josiah had clearly had but a temporary success, and the people had gone back to the confluent polytheism of the reign of Manasseh. In such a state of things the worst was possible. For recent discussions on the <span class="accented">Ashera</span>, see Kuenen. 'Relig. Isr.' (Eng. transl.), 1:88; Schrader; Robertson Smith, 'Relig. of Semites,' p. 172; and T.K. Cheyne, in the <span class="accented">Academy</span> of December 14, 1889. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-4.htm">Ezekiel 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i>was</i> there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold,</span> etc. In appalling contrast with that "image of jealousy," Ezekiel saw what he had not seen, as he first became conscious that he was in the court of the temple - the vision of the Divine glory, such as he had seen it on the banks of Chebar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-28</a>). He was to look first on this picture and then on that, and the guilt of Judah was measured by that contrast.

The temple was already as a God-deserted shrine. His return to it now was but the coming of the Judge and the Destroyer. We are reminded of the <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ("Let us depart hence"), which was heard in the darkness of the night before the later destruction of Jerusalem (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.' 6:05.3) Bad begins, but worse remains behind. The prophet is led onward as through the successive stages of an <span class="accented">inferno</span> of idolatries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-7.htm">Ezekiel 8:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the door of the court.</span> What follows suggests that the prophet was led to the gate that opened from the inner to the outer court. This gas surrounded by chambers or cells (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>). The term for "wall" (<span class="accented">kir</span>) is that specially used for the wall which encloses a whole group of buildings (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold a hole in the wall.</span> The fact was clearly significant. The worship here was more clandestine than that of the "image of jealousy." We are not warranted, perhaps, in insisting on minute consistency in the world of visions, but the question naturally arises - How did  the worshippers enter the chamber if Ezekiel had to enlarge the hole in the wall in order to get in? We may surmise that the entrance from the temple court had been blocked up all but entirely in the days of Josiah, that the idolaters now entered it from without or through some other chamber, while Ezekiel thinks of himself as coming upon them like a spy in the dim distance of the covered passage through which he made his way. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-8.htm">Ezekiel 8:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had digged in the wall, behold a door.</div><div class="comm">

The alliance between Jehoiakim and Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>:33-35), and which Zedekiah was endeavouring to renew, would naturally bring about a revival of that cultus. Small chambers in rock or tomb filled with such pictured symbols were specially characteristic of it (<span class="accented">Gosse</span>, 'Monuments of Egypt,' p. 6; 'Ammian. Marcellin.,' 22:15). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-11.htm">Ezekiel 8:11</a></div><div class="verse">And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy men</span>, etc. The number was probably chosen with reference to the "elders" who had seen the Divine glory in <a href="../../par/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9, 10</a>. The Sanhedrin, or council of seventy, did not exist till after the Captivity. The number can scarcely have been accidental, and may imply that the elders were formally representative. Another Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, appears in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>; yet another, the son of Azur, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>. If the Shaphan mentioned is the scribe, the son of Azaliah, under Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), the father of Ahikam (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), of Elasah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>), and of Gemariah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10, 11, 12</a>), and the grandfather of Gedaliah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), all of whom were prominent in the reform movement under Josiah, or as friends of Jeremiah, and no other Shaphan appears in history, the fact that one of his sons is the leader of the idolatrous company must have had for Ezekiel a specially painful significance. He could scarcely have forgotten the meaning of his name, "The Lord is listening," and probably refers to it in ver. 12. As the climax of this chamber of horrors, the seventy elders were all acting as priests, and were offering to their pictured idols the incense which none but the sons of Aaron had a right to use, and which they offered to Jehovah only. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every man,</span> etc. And this, after all, was but a sample of the prevalence of the Egyptian influence. Other elders had, <span class="cmt_word">in the dark</span>, a like <span class="accented">adytum</span>, a like chamber of imagery, like the Latin <span class="accented">lararium</span>, filled. with a like cloud of incense. And though the name of the leader of the band might have warned them that the Lord was listening, they boasted, in their blindness, that Jehovah did not see them; he had forsaken the temple, and had fiche elsewhere. They thought of Jehovah as of a local deity who had abdicated. They were free to do as they liked without fear. The words are worth noting further as the first of a series of popular half proverbs, in which the thoughts of the people clothed themselves (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-2.htm">Ezekiel 18:2, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Ezekiel 37:11</a>).

All interpreters, however, agree that it answers to the Adonis of Greek mythology. So Jerome translates it, and expressly states (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) that what Ezekiel saw corresponded to the Adonis festivals. It may be enough to state, without going into the details of the story, that Adonis, the beautiful youth beloved of Aphrodite, was slain by a wild boar; that after his death he was allowed to spend six months of each year with her, while the other was passed with Persephone in Hades. The cultus thus became the symbol of the annual decay and revival of nature; but the legend rather than the inner meaning was in the thoughts of the worshippers. The emotions of women poured themselves out in lamentations over the waxen image of the beautiful dead youth who had perished in his prime, and in orgiastic joy over his return to life. Milton, deriving his knowledge, probably, from Selden's 'De Diis Syris,' has painted the whole atone in words which may well be quoted - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Thammuz next came behind,<br />Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br />The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br />In amorous ditties all a summer's day;<br />While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br />Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br />Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br />Infected Sion's daughters with like heat;<br />Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br />Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br />His eyes surveyed the dark idolatries<br />Of alienated Judah."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Par. Lost,' 1:446, etc.</span>) The chief centre of the Tammuz-Adonis worship was Byblos, in Syria. but it spread widely over the shores of the Mediterranean and was fashionable both in Alexandria and Athens. One of the practices of the festival, that of planting flowers in vases for forced cultivation, has been perpetuated by Plato's allusion to "the gardens of Adonis" as the type of transitoriness ('Phaedr.' p. 376, b). Cheyne, following Lagarde, finds a reference to the cultus in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-10.htm">Isaiah 17:10</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-3.htm">Isaiah 65:3</a>: 66:17. The festival of Ishtar and Tammuz (or <span class="accented">Tam-zi</span>) at Babylon presented a marked parallel. Adonis is, with hardly a doubt, identical with the Hebrew <span class="accented">Adonai</span> (equivalent to "Lord"). <span class="accented">Tammuz</span> has been explained as meaning "victorious," or "disappearance," or "burning;" but all etymologies are conjectural. Lastly, it is not without interest to note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that when Jerome wrote, the Cave of the Nativity at Bethlehem was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz ('Ep. ad Paul.'); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the later Jewish calendar included the month of Tammuz, which corresponded to July. The festival seems to have been celebrated at the summer solstice. The time of Ezekiel's vision was in the sixth month, <span class="accented">sc.</span> about the time of the autumnal equinox (see 'Dict. Bible,' art. "Tammuz"). Mr. Baring-Gould, treating the legend as a solar myth, finds the old Phoenician deity represented in the "St. George of Merrie England" ('Curious Myths,' pp. 277-316). An exhaustive monograph, "Tammuz Adonis," has been published by Liebrecht, in his 'Zur Volkskunde' (1879), reprinted from the <span class="accented">Zeitschrift Deutschen Morgen-Gesellschaft</span>, vol. 17. pp. 397, etc.

It was the "inner court" (<a href="../../par/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>) which, after the exile, was entered only by the priests. During the monarchy, however, it seems to have been accessible to kings and other persons of importance, as in the case of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 64</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>) in the revolution against Athaliah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4-15</a>), and Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a>), and Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>). Ezekiel does not say that the men whom he saw were priests, though the number twenty-five suggests that they were taking the place of the high priest and the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-4.htm">1 Chronicles 24:4-19</a>), and so symbolized the whole order of the priesthood as the seventy elders represented the laity. In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a> the chief of the priests is spoken of as having been prominent in "polluting the house of the Lord." They were seen turning their backs to the temple of Jehovah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sanctuary. The very act was symbolical of their apostasy (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-6.htm">2 Chronicles 29:6</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>). And they did this in order that they might look to the east and worship the rising sun. That, and not the temple (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>), was the <span class="accented">Kiblah</span> of their adoration. The sun worship here appears to have had a Persian character, as being offered to the sun itself, and not to Baal, as a solar god. Of such a worship we have traces in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5, 11</a>.

The act described probably finds its best explanation in the Persian ritual of the Avesta. When men prayed to the sun, they held in their left hands a bouquet of palm, pomegranate, and tamarisk twigs, while the priests for the same purpose held a veil before their mouth (Spiegel, 'Iran. Alterth.,' 3:571, 572, in Smend), so that the bright rays of the sun might not be polluted by human breath. And this was done in the very temple of Jehovah by those who were polluting the whole land by their violence. The LXX. gives, as an explanation, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, as though the act was one of scornful pride (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>), the sign of a temper like that of the Pharisee as he looked upon the publican (<a href="../../par/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11</a>). Lightfoot takes the "nose" as the symbol of anger, and looks on the phrase as proverbial: "They add the twig to their anger, fuel to the fire;" but this has little to commend it. The word for "branch" is used in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-2.htm">Ezekiel 15:2</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a> for a vine branch.

Here, however, it clearly stands for persons (just as we use "the watch" for "the watchmen"), and is so used in <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-17.htm">Isaiah 60:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-18.htm">2 Kings 11:18</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-11.htm">Ezekiel 44:11</a>). The persons addressed are called "men," but they are clearly thought of as superhuman; like the angels who came to Sodom (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-1.htm">Genesis 19:1</a>); like the angel with the drawn sword in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a>. <span class="cmt_word">His destroying weapon.</span> The word clearly implies something different from a sword, but corresponds in its vagueness to the Hebrew. In ver. 2 the Hebrew for "slaughter weapon" implies an instrument for crashing into fragments, probably an axe or mace. A cognate word in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a> is translated "battle axe," and the LXX. gives that meaning here, as also does the margin of the Revised Version.

They appear, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as issuing from the Divine presence to do their work of judgment. Possibly. as in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1.htm">Jeremiah 1</a>, there may be an allusive reference to the fact that the Chaldeans, as the actual instruments of their judgment, came from the same region.

It was to be the work of this scribe (ver. 4) to mark such as were for death to death, such as were for life to life. The LXX., misunderstanding the Hebrew, or following a different text, gives, not "a writer's inkhorn," but "a girdle of sapphire." With all the precision of one who knew every inch of the temple courts, the priest-prophet sees the visitants take their station beside the brazen altar, probably, as they came from the north, on the north side of it.

This may be connected also with the thought that the normal abiding place of the presence of the Lord had been "between the cherubim" (<a href="../../par/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>) of the mercy seat, but that thought seems in the present instance to be in the background, and I adopt the former interpretation as preferable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-4.htm">Ezekiel 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set a mark upon the foreheads,</span> etc. The command reminds us of that given to the destroying angel in <a href="../../par/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>, and has its earlier and later analogues in the mark set upon Cain (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-15.htm">Genesis 4:15</a>), and in the "sealing" of the servants of God in <a href="../../par/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>. Here, as in the last example, the mark is set, not on the lintels of the doorposts, but upon the "foreheads" of the men. And the mark is the letter <span class="accented">tau</span>, in old Hebrew, that of a cross + , and like the "mark" of mediaeval and (in the case of the illiterate) of modern usage, seems to have been used as a signature, and is rightly so translated in the Revised Version of <a href="../../par/job/31-35.htm">Job 31:35</a>. Jewish writers have accounted for its being thus used, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from its being the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and thus denoting completeness, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from its being the first letter of the word <span class="accented">thorah</span> (Law); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> from its standing in the same position in the Hebrew word for "thou shalt live." Christian writers (Origen, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>; Tertullian, 'Adv. Marcion,' 3:22) have not unnaturally seen in it a quasi-prophetic reference to the sign of the cross as used by Christians, and it is possible that the use of that sign in baptism may have  originated in this passage. That was to be the sign of the elect of God in the midst of a world lying in wickedness. Possibly in older as in later forms of idolatry (as <span class="accented">eg.</span> in the cultus of Mithras, Vishnu, Sehiva), the votaries of this or that deity may have been distinguished by some outward note of this kind; but of this, though suggested by Currey, I do not find any evidence. It is clear, however, that there could be no anticipation of the Christian symbolism in the minds of Ezeldel or of his hearers. The "mark" was to be placed on all who were still faithful to the worship of their fathers, though they could show their faithfulness only by lamentation of the national apostasy. Such, of course, were Jeremiah, and Baruch, and Ahikam, and Shaphan, and Gedaliah, and others, and such as these Ezekiel may have had present in his thoughts. Against all others (ver. 5) they were sent forth with unsparing severity.

With the words which had been the keynote of <span class="accented">Isaiah's</span> prophecies, probably present to his thoughts (<a href="../../par/isaiah/37-32.htm">Isaiah 37:32</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), he asks whether Jehovah will indeed destroy all that <span class="accented">remnant</span> of Israel (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-13.htm">Ezekiel 11:13</a>) who might be as the germ of hope for the future. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-9.htm">Ezekiel 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah <i>is</i> exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he unto me.</span> The answer holds out but little comfort. <span class="cmt_word">The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah</span> (we note the coupling of the names though Judah only was the immediate subject of the vision, as if his prayer had gone up for the whole body of the twelve tribes) was immeasurably great. Not idolatry only, but its natural fruits, bloodshed and oppression, had eaten into the life of the nation (comp. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-25.htm">Ezekiel 22:25</a>). And these evils had their root in the practical atheism of the denials which had been already uttered in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-12.htm">Ezekiel 8:12</a>. and which are here reproduced. The unpitying aspect of God's judgments is, for the present, dominant, and the work must be thorough. One notes how the despair of the prophet leads him to forget those who were to have the mark upon their foreheads, who were indeed the true "remnant." Like Elijah, he does not know of any such (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>); like Jeremiah, he searches through the streets of Jerusalem, and cannot find one righteous man (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/5-1.htm">Jeremiah 5:1</a>).
