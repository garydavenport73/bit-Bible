It is nearly the same thing to say that the true faith, and the perfect knowledge of the truth, and the hope of eternal life promised by God, are the sphere in which the apostolic office moves and acts. "The faith of God's elect," etc., seems to imply that there was in some who were not elect (<a href="../../par/1_john/2-19.htm">1 John 2:19, 20</a>) a corruption of the faith, a departure from it - a faith that was no faith, and something calling itself <span class="accented">truth</span> which was not "according to godliness," and so to point to rising heresies. The authors of these heresies were chiefly Jews (ver. 10), of whom there was a considerable colony in Crete (Conybeare and Howson, vol. it. p. 475; and Lewin, vol. 2. p. 337). According to godliness (for the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the pastoral Epistles, see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-2.htm">1 Timothy 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3, 5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>, and notes).

The phrase is equivalent to "the fullness of the time" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Manifested his Word.</span> There is a change of construction. "The relative sentence passes almost imperceptibly into a primary sentence" (Buttmann in Huther); "his Word" becomes the object of the verb "made manifest," instead of "eternal life," as one would have expected. <span class="cmt_word">His Word</span> is the whole revelation of the gospel, including the Person and work of Jesus Christ. Compare St. Peter's address to Cornelius (<a href="../../par/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>). This "Word," which lay in the mind of God  through the ages, and was only dimly expressed in the promises given from time to time (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10-12</a>), was now "<span class="accented">made</span> manifest," and proclaimed openly in that preaching of the gospel of God's grace which was entrusted to St. Paul. This same idea is frequently expressed (see <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3-11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>), <span class="cmt_word">In the message.</span> Surely a poor and a false rendering. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "by the open proclamation" which St. Paul, as God's herald, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, was commanded to make.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Were</span> for <span class="accented">are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appoint</span> for <span class="accented">ordain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gave thee charge</span> for <span class="accented">had appointed thee</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Left I thee in Crete.</span> We have no account of St. Paul's visit to Crete, nor do we know how the gospel was first brought to Crete. It may have been by some of those "Cretes" who were at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, and heard the apostles speak in their tongue "the wonderful works of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>), or by other Christian Jews visiting the Jewish community in Crete (note to ver. 1). If St. Paul was returning from Spain, and travelling by ship eastward, Crete would be on his way. The importance of the island, with which he made some acquaintance on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7, 8</a>), and the large Jewish colony there, may naturally have inclined him to visit it. How long he remained there we do not know, but he did not stay long enough to organize the Church there completely. There were still things "wanting" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), as it follows. This mention of Crete is an important chronological mark. The order of St. Paul's progress, as gathered from the three pastoral Epistles, is very distinct - Crete, Miletus, Troas, Macedonia, Corinth, Nicopolis, Rome. He dropped Titus at Crete, and left Timothy behind at Ephesus. The Epistle to Titus, therefore, is the first of the three pastoral Epistles, and this is borne out by another circumstance. When he wrote to Titus he had not made up his mind whether he should send Artemas or Tychicus to take his place in Crete when he rejoined the apostle (<a href="../../par/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). But when he wrote 2 Timothy he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus to replace Timothy (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>), and Titus had already joined him, and been sent on by him to Dalmatia, presumably from Nicopolis. <span class="cmt_word">Set in order</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek, except as a technical word in the art of rhetoric. But <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is very common in classical Greek (<span class="accented">see</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the compound here is "further," or "in addition." St. Paul had set the Church in order up to a certain point. But there were still certain things wanting, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (see <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>); and these Titus was to supply and give the finishing touch to. <span class="cmt_word">Appoint</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). This is a better rendering than the A.V. "ordain," because it is a general word for "to appoint, make." Probably the A.V. "ordain" was not intended to be taken in a strictly technical sense, but is used as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>. The technical word was usually "to order." "The Ordering of Deacons," or "of Priests," is the title of the service in the Book of Common Prayer. "Meet to be ordered," "shall surcease from ordering," occur repeatedly in the rubrics, <span class="cmt_word">Elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presbyters, or priests (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; and see <a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">In every city</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); city by city. The phrase has a peculiar significance in Crete, which used to be famous for its hundred cities. It shows, too, that Christianity was widely spread among the cities of the island. The germ of the episcopal office, one bishop and many presbyters, is here very conspicuous.

The idea of <span class="accented">kindness</span> or <span class="accented">good nature</span> seems to be the side of goodness here intended; as we say, "He was very good to me" (so <a href="../../par/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>).

Our Lord, on the other hand, exhorts that Christians, by their good works, should lead men to glorify their Father which is in heaven. The passage before us shows how much the honor of Christianity is bound up with the faithful discharge by Christians of the simple domestic duties of life. In truth, the <span class="accented">family</span> is the chief <span class="accented">seat</span>, and often the main test, of Christian virtue, as it is the distinctive feature of humanity as ordained by God.

Here the hope is called emphatically "the blessed hope," the hope of Christ's second coming in glory, that hope which is the joy and life, the strength and comfort, of every Christian soul. This is the only place in the New Testament where <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is applied to an object which does not itself enjoy the blessing, but is a source of blessing to others. Of the fifty passages where it occurs it is applied in forty-three to persons, twice to God, three times to parts of the body (the Virgin's womb, and the eyes and ears of those who saw and heard Christ), once impersonally ("It is more blessed to give," etc., <a href="../../par/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>), and once, in this passage, to the hope. <span class="cmt_word">And appearing of the glory.</span> In construing this clause, as well as the following, the same difficulty occurs. There is only one article to the two subjects. The question arises - Can two different subjects stand under one article? Huther affirms that they can, and refers for proof to Buttman and Wince; and, indeed, it is impossible to treat "the hope" and the "appearing" as one subject. Accepting this, the clause before us should be rendered, <span class="accented">Looking for the blessed hope, and the appearing of the glory of the great God.</span> This is a description of the second coming of the Lord, of whom it is expressly said that he will "come in the glory of his Father" (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>). The appearing of Christ will be the appearing of the glory of the great God, not the appearing of God the Father, to whom the term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is never applied, but of the Son, who is the Brightness of his Father's glory. <span class="cmt_word">Our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.</span> No doubt the Greek words can be so rendered, and perhaps (grammatically) most naturally, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>, where we read, "The kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ;" and so <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>. But, on the other hand, according to what is said above, they need not be so rendered. "The great God" and "our Savior Jesus Christ" may be two separate subjects, as "the blessed hope" and "appearing of the glory" are. Anti we have to inquire, from the usual language of Scripture, which of the two is most probable. Alford, in a long note, shows that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> is often used without the article (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>); that in analogous sentences: where <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used as our Lord's title, an exactly similar construction to that in the text is employed, as <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-2.htm">2 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-3.htm">Galatians 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-2.htm">Ephesians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-23.htm">Ephesians 6:23</a>, etc. He also observes, after Wince, that the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is an additional reason for the omission of the article before <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>, and elsewhere; and that the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> makes it still more difficult to connect <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; and lastly, he compares this passage with <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3, 5, 6</a>, and thinks the conclusion inevitable that the apostle, writing two sentences so closely corresponding - written, it may be added, so near to one another in time - would have had in view, in both passages, the same distinction of persons which is so strongly marked in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3, 5</a>. On these grounds he pronounces against the rendering which is adopted by the Revised Version. Huther's conclusion is the same: partly from the grammatical possibility of <span class="accented">two</span> subjects (here <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) having only one article, which leaves the question of whether there are here one or <span class="accented">two</span> subjects to be decided on other grounds than simple grammar; and partly and chiefly from the double consideration that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">nowhere</span> in Scripture is <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> connected directly with <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span> so often are; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the collocation of God (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) and Christ as two subjects is of constant occurrence, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-13.htm">1 Timothy 6:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>; to which may probably be added <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:12</a>; he decides, surely rightly, that the clause should be rendered, <span class="accented">the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ.</span> Another question arises whether <span class="cmt_word">the glory</span> belongs to both subjects. Probably, though not necessarily, it does, since we are told in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a> that "the Son of man shall come in the glory of the Father;" and in <a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31</a>, "the Son of man shall come in his glory" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>).

It is difficult to hit upon any conclusive argument for one side or the other.

If these had been persons seeking admission into the Church, or ordination, it would mean "refuse them." Vitringa (Huther) thinks it means "excommunication."

So the heretics were self-condemned by the very fact that they continued to head the schism after repeated admonitions.

He would not leave the presbyters in either place without the direction and superintendence of one having his delegated apostolic authority. This led to the final placing of a resident bishop in the Churches, such as we find in the second century.
