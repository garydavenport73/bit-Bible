Some years later, indeed, when St. Peter had occasion to address these same Churches, together with others in neighbouring countries, he likewise felt himself authorized to do it on the score of his apostolical character ("Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ," <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>); but there is nothing to show that St. Peter had any personal relations with them at present. Under these circumstances, it is perhaps best in translation to prefix no article at all before "apostle." This designation of himself as "apostle' St. Paul subjoined to his name in almost all of his Epistles subsequent to the two addressed to the Thessalonians. The only exceptions are those to the Philippians and to Philemon, in writing to whom there was less occasion for introducing it. He had now, in the third of his three great journeys recorded in the Acts, assumed openly in the Church the position of an apostle in the highest sense. In several of these Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>), to the designation of apostle, St. Paul adds the words," through (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) the will of God;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by means of an express volition of God explicitly revealed. In what way God had revealed this to be his will is clearly intimated in this letter to the Galatians, in which the words," through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead," which take the place of the formula, "through the will of God,"  found elsewhere, indicate that it was through Jesus Christ raised from the dead that this particular volition of God was declared and brought to eft;set. The formula referred to, "through the will of God," was apparently introduced with the view of confronting those who were disposed to question his right to claim this supreme form of apostleship, with the aegis of Divine authorization: they had God to reckon with. The like is the purport of the substituted words in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-1.htm">1 Timothy 1:1</a>, "According to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our Hope." <span class="cmt_word">Not of men, neither by man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">not from men</span>, <span class="accented">neither through</span> a man. The preposition "from" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) points to the primary fountain of the delegation referred to; "through" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) to the medium through which it was conveyed. The necessity for this twofold negation arose from the fact that the word "apostle," as I have had occasion fully to set forth elsewhere, was frequently among Christians applied to messengers deputed by Churches, or, probably, even by some important representative officer in the Church, whether on a mission for the propagation of the gospel or for the discharge at some distant place of matters of business connected with the Christian cause. St. Paul had himself frequently served in this lower form of apostleship, both as commissioned by the Church to carry abroad tim message of the gospel, and also as deputed to go to and fro between Churches on errands of charity or for the settlement of controversies. In either case he as well as others acting in the like capacity, would very naturally and properly be spoken of as an "apostle" by others, as we actually find him to have been; as also he would appear to have been ready on this same account so to designate himself, That he was an "apostle" in this sense none probably would have been minded to dispute. Why should they? His having, even repeatedly, held this kind of subordinate commission did not of itself give him a greater importance than attached to many ethers who had held the same. Neither did it invest <span class="accented">his</span> statements of religious truth with a higher sanction than theirs. This last was the point which, in St. Paul's own estimation, gave the question of the real nature of his apostleship its whole significance. Was he a commissioned envoy of men, deputed to convey to others a message of <span class="accented">theirs</span>? or was he an envoy commissioned immediately by Christ to convey to the world a message which likewise was received immediately from Christ? Those who disputed his statements of religious doctrine might admit that he had been deputed to preach the gospel by Christian Churches or by eminently representative leaders of the Church, while they nevertheless asserted that he had misrepresented, or perhaps misapprehended, the message entrusted to him. At all events, they would be at liberty to affirm that the statements he made in delivering his message were subject to an appeal on the part of his hearers to the human authorities who had delegated him. If he owed alike his commission and his message to (say) the Church of Antioch, or to the Church at Jerusalem, or to the twelve, or to James the Lord's brother, or to other leaders whomsoever of the venerable mother Church, then it followed that he was to be held amenable to their overruling judgment in the discharge of this apostleship of his. What he taught had no force if this higher court of appeal withheld its sanction. Now, this touched no mere problematical contingency, but was a practical issue which, just at this time, was one of even vital importance. It had an intimate connection with the fierce antagonism of contending parties in the Church, then waged over the dying body of the Levitical Law. St. Paul's mission as an apostle is most reasonably considered to (late from the time when, as he stated in his defence before King Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16, 17</a>), the Lord Jesus said to him, "To this end have I appeared unto time, to appoint thee a minister and a witness [<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>: comp. <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2, 3, 8, 22</a>] both of the things wherein thou hast seen me, and of the things wherein I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people [<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, so.

T. Tr. Rev.; the Textus Receptus reads <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>]" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>). But though his appointment was in reality coeval with his conversion, it was only in course of time and by slow degrees that his properly apostolic function became signalized to the consciousness of the Church. Nevertheless, there is no reason for doubting that to his own consciousness his vocation as apostle was clearly manifested from the very first. The prompt and independent manner in which he at once set himself to preach the gospel, which itself, he tells the Galatians in this chapter, he had received immediately from heaven, betokens his having this consciousness.  The time and the manner in which the fact was to become manifest to others he would seem, in a spirit of compliant obedience, to have left to the ordering of his Master. <span class="cmt_word">But by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but through Jesus Christ</span>, <span class="accented">and God the Father</span>, <span class="accented">who raised him from the dead.</span> The conjunction "neither" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>), which comes before <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, marks the clause it introduces as containing a distinctly different negation from the preceding, and shows that the preposition "through" is used in contradistinction to the "from" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) of the foregoing clause in its proper sense of denoting the instrument or medium <span class="accented">through</span> which an act is done. St. Paul affirms that there was no <span class="accented">human</span> instrumentality or intermediation whatever at work in the act of delegation which constituted him an apostle. This affirmation places him in this respect precisely on a level with the twelve; perhaps in making it he has an eye 1o this. The notion has been frequently broached that the apostleship which St. Paul made claim to was conveyed to him at Antioch through the brethren who there, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, formally set him apart, together with Barnabas, for the missionary enterprise which they forthwith entered upon (<a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a>). But words could scarcely have been selected which should more decisively negative any such notion than those do which St. Paul here makes use cf. One form of apostleship was no doubt then conferred upon Barnabas and Paul; but it was not the apostleship of which he is now thinking (see essay on "Apostles," pp. 31, 32.). In defining the precise import and bearing of the expression, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "through a man," we may compare it with its use in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-21.htm">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>, "Since <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> death, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="accented">came</span> also the resurrection of the dead;" where in the second clause the word "man," employed to recite the Lord Jesus, contemplates that aspect of his twofold being which places him as "the second Man" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-47.htm">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>) in correlation to Adam, "the first Man." Similarly, the parallel with Adam again in <a href="../../par/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12, 15</a> leads the apostle to adopt the expression," the one Man Jesus Christ" (cf. also ibid. 19). In <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, "There is one God, one Mediator also between God and men, himself Man [or, 'a man'], Christ Jesus," our Lord's manhood, in accordance with the requirement of the context, is put forward as a bond of connection linking him with every human creature alike. These passages present Christ in the character simply of a human being. But in the passage before us the apostle at first sight appears to imply that, because he was an apostle through the agency of Jesus Christ, he was not an apostle through the agency of a human being; thus negativing, apparently, the manhood of Christ, at least as viewed in his present glorified condition. The inference, however, is plainly contradicted by both <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-21.htm">1 Corinthians 15:21</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; for the former passage points in "the second Man" to the "Lord from heaven," while the other refers to him as permanent "Mediator between God and men," both, therefore, speaking of Jesus in his present glorified condition. To obviate this difficulty some have proposed to take the "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>), not as <span class="accented">adversative</span>, but as <span class="accented">exceptive.</span> But there is no justification for this - not even <a href="../../par/mark/9-8.htm">Mark 9:8</a> (see Winer's 'Gram. N. T.,' 53, 10, 1 <span class="accented">b</span>). A less precarious solution is arrived at by gathering out of the context the precise shade of meaning in which the word "man" is here used. Christ is indeed "Man," and his true manhood is the sense required in the two passages above cited; but he is also more than man; and it is those qualities of his being and of his state of existence which distinguish him from mere men, which the context shows to be now present to the apostle's mind. For the phrase, "through a man," is not contrasted by the words, "through Jesus Christ," alone, but by the whole clause: "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father who raised him from the dead." That is to say, in penning the former phrase, the apostle indicates by the word "man" one invested with the ordinary qualities of an earthly human condition; whereas the "Jesus Christ" through whom Heaven sent forth Saul as an apostle to the Gentiles was Jesus Christ blended with, inconceivably near to, God the Father, one with him; his oneness with him not veiled, as it was when he was upon earth, though really subsisting even then (<a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>), but to all the universe manifested - manifested visibly to us upon earth by the resurrection of his body; in the spiritual, as yet <span class="accented">now</span> to us invisible world, by that sitting down on the right hand of God which was the implied sequel and climax of his resurrection. The strong sense which the apostle has of the unspeakably intimate conjunction subsisting. since his resurrection, between Jesus Christ viewed in his whole incarnate being and. God the Father, explains how it comes to pass that the two august Names are combined together under one single preposition, "through Jesus Christ, and God the Father." We shall have to notice the same phenomenon in ver. 3 in the apostle's formula of greeting prayer, "Grace to you and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ;" on which see the note. We have the same conception of Christ's personality  consequent upon his resurrection in the apostle's words relative to his apostolic appointment in <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4, 5</a>; where the Jesus Christ through whom "he had received grace and apostleship," in contrast with his merely human condition as "of the seed of David according to the flesh," is described as "him who was declared <span class="accented">to be</span> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection of the dead." The clause, "who raised him from the dead," has a twofold bearing upon the point in hand. 1. It supplies an answer to the objection which may be believed to have been made to Paul's claim to be regarded as an apostle sent forth by Jesus Christ, by those who said, "You have never seen Christ or been taught by him, like those whom he himself named apostles." The answer is, "You might object so if Jesus were no more than a dead man; but he is not that: he is a living Man raised from the dead by the Father; and as such I have myself seen him (cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>); and he it was that in his own person, and through no intervention of human agency, gave me both the commission to preach and the gospel which I was to preach" (see below, vers. 11, 12). 2. It connects the action of God the Father with that of Jesus Christ in appointing Paul to be an apostle; for the things which Christ did when raised from the dead and glorified with himself (<a href="../../par/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>) by the Father must obviously have been done from, with, and in God the Father. It would unduly narrow the <span class="accented">pragmatism</span> of the clause if we limited it to either of the two purposes above indicated; both were probably in the mind of St. Paul in adding it. The immediate context gives no warrant for our supposing, as many have done, that the apostle has just here other truths in view as involved in the fact of our Lord's resurrection; such <span class="accented">e.g.</span> as he has himself indicated in <a href="../../par/romans/4-24.htm">Romans 4:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>. However cogent and closely relevant some of these inferences might have been with respect to the subjects treated of in this Epistle, the Epistle itself, as a matter of fact, makes no other reference whatever to that great event, whether directly or indirectly. Should <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> be rendered "through man," the noun understood <span class="accented">generically</span>, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/56-1.htm">Psalm 56:1</a> (Septuagint), or "through a man," pointing to one individual being? It is not very material; but perhaps the second rendering is recommended by the consideration that, if the apostle had meant still to write generically, he would have repeated the plural noun already employed. Indeed, it may be thought a preferable rendering in the other passages above cited. The transition from the plural noun to the singular, as is noted by Bishop Lightfoot and others, "suggested itself in anticipation of the clause, 'through Jesus Christ,' which was to follow." In the expression, "God the Father," the addition of the words, "the Father," was not necessary for the indication of the Person meant, any more than in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-21.htm">1 Peter 1:21</a>, "Believers in God which raised him from the dead," or in numberless other passages where the term "God" regularly designates the First Person in the blessed Trinity. It would be an incomplete paraphrase to explain it either as "God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," or as "God our Father." It is rather, "God the primary Author and supreme Orderer of all things," or, as in the Creed, "God the Father Almighty." It is best illustrated by the apostle's words in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>, "<span class="accented">To</span> us there is one God, the Father, of whom [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> out of whom, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>] are all things, and we unto him; "and in <a href="../../par/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>," Of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things." The apostle adds the term in order to make the designation of the supreme God, who is the Source of his apostleship, the more august and impressive.

Its position here, where, perhaps, it was thrust in by a kind of after-thought, marks it as emphatic; there is not one of those about him who does not feel the like grief and indignation as himself in reference to the news just now received. We have a similar collocation in <a href="../../par/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> would be marked as emphatic also if placed last, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-7.htm">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-15.htm">Titus 3:15</a>. Our attention is arrested by the absence of any name. A number of persons are named by St. Luke in the Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18-20:5</a>), and by the apostle himself in his Epistles to the Corinthians and to the Romans, as about his person at different times during the latter part of his third journey; and it does not seem very likely that not one was now with him of those who had accompanied him, either in the first or in the second of his two visits in Galatia. The most probable way of explaining the entire suppression of names is by reference to the present mood of the writer; he is too indignant at the behaviour of the Galatian Churchmen to weave into his greeting any such thread of mutual personal interest. It is enough to intimate that all about him felt as he did. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Churches of Galatia</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). The dry coldness of tone with which this is written will be best understood by the reader upon his comparing the apostle's manner in his other letters, in all of which he is found adding  some words marking the high dignity which attached to the communities he is addressing. He is too much displeased to do this now. The plurality of the Galatian Churches, each of them apparently forming a distinct organization, is expressed again in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>, "As I gave order to the Churches of Galatia;" and agrees very well with what we read in <a href="../../par/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>, "Went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), stablishing all the disciples." The leaven of Judaizing, whether imported by visitants from other regions or originating within these Churches themselves, appears to have been working very extensively among these communities, and not in one or two of them only. If the latter had been the case, the apostle would not have involved the collective Churches in the like censure, but, as in the case of Colossae, compared with the "<span class="accented">Ephesians</span>," have singled out for warning those actually peccant. This fact, of the general diffusion among them of one particular taint, warrants the belief that certain persons had been at the pains of going about among these Churches to propagate it. Who these persons were, or where they came from, there is nothing to show. It has, indeed, been assumed by many that, like those disturbers of the Antiochian Church mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a> and <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, they had come from Judaea, or rather Jerusalem. But the Epistle gives no hint of this in respect to the Galatian Churches. What the apostle writes in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12, 13</a> points rather to the surmise that this particular distraction was caused by some Churchmen of their own, who had given themselves to this heretical proselytizing in order to truckle to non-Christian Jews living in their neighbourhood. Compare the apostle's foreboding respecting the future of the Ephesian Church, in <a href="../../par/acts/20-30.htm">Acts 20:30</a>. (See note on Galatians 6:12, 13.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-3.htm">Galatians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God the Father, and <i>from</i> our Lord Jesus Christ,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace be to you and peace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">grace to you and peace.</span> Here, as often, we have combined the form of salutation prevalent among Greeks, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (found in its unaltered form in <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>, "wishing joy"), Christianized into <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, grace, which denotes the outpouring of Divine benignity in all such spiritual blessings as sinful creatures need; and the Hebrew greeting, <span class="accented">shalom</span>, which in its transformation into <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> may be supposed to have dropped in its Christianized signification some of its originally comprehensive meaning, which comprised all "health and wealth" as well as "peace," and to have generally expressed the more limited idea of that calm sense of reconciliation and that perfect security against evil which constitute the peculiar happiness of a soul which believes in Christ. It is nevertheless conceivable that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as used in Hellenistic Greek, may at times have widened the sense proper to it in ordinary Greek into the more comprehensive import of the <span class="accented">shalom</span>, which it was regularly employed to represent. <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). These words regularly form a part in the apostle's formula of greeting. With slight variations they are found in all his Epistles, except, perhaps, the First to the Thessalonians, where, though read in the Textus Receptus, they are omitted by recent editors. "Our" is added to "Father" in at least seven of St. Paul's Epistles (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Philemon). This warrants the belief that, when as in 1 Timothy, Titus, and here, he wrote "God the Father," he most probably did so with reference to God's fatherly relation to the members of Christ's Church. Tregelles and the margin of the revised Greek text, in fact, read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> here, omitting it after <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Uniformly in this formula of greeting we find only one preposition, "from" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>), before the two names, "God" and "Jesus Christ;" as in the first verse in this Epistle there is only one preposition, "<span class="accented">through</span>," before "Jesus Christ" and "God." The apostle, looking upwards, discerns, as St. Stephen did, in the ineffable glory, the supreme God in whom he recognizes "our Father," and with him Jesus Christ, "our Lord;" that is, our Master, Head, Mediator, "<span class="accented">through</span> whom are all things, and we through him." Grace and peace coming down from heaven, must come <span class="accented">from</span> God our Father <span class="accented">and</span> Jesus Christ our Lord. From the very nature of the case it is obvious that the blessings referred to come to us <span class="accented">through</span> Christ, though also "<span class="accented">from"</span> him; as also that St. Paul's delegation as apostle, spoken of in the first verse, originated <span class="accented">from</span> a volition and appointment of God the Father, as well as was brought about "<span class="accented">through"</span> the ordering of his providence. But in each case the preposition used by the apostle preserves its proper force, not to be confused by our thrusting into it another notion not just then in the writer's view. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who gave himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the strongest imaginable description of what Christ did to redeem us. The phrase occurs in 1 Macc. 6:44, with reference to the Eleazar who rushed upon certain death to kill the elephant which was carrying the king, Antiochus: "He gave himself (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) to save his people." It is applied to Christ also in <a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>," Who gave himself for us;" and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>, "Who gave himself a ransom for all." In the next chapter, ver. 20, the apostle writes, "Who loved me, and gave himself up (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for me." Similarly, St. Paul writes  in <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>, "He that spared not [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'kept not back'] his own Son, but gave him <span class="accented">up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>) for us all." The addition, in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>, of the words, "into the hands of sinners," and our Lord's utterance in <a href="../../par/luke/22-53.htm">Luke 22:53</a>, "This is your hour, and the power of darkness," help to illustrate the exceedingly pregnant expression now before us. <span class="cmt_word">For our sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). This is the reading of the Textus Receptus, retained by the Revisers. On the other hand, L. T. Tr., for <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, substitute <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>. These two prepositions <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> are, in this relation as well as in some others, used indifferently. If we follow the reading of Rec. L. T. Tr. Rev. (for very often the manuscripts oscillate between the two), we have <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, "Died for our sins;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>, "To offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7</a>, "Blood, which he offereth for himself, and for the ignorances of the people." On the other hand, we find in the same authorities <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "Sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>, "As for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins" (where, however, the Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in the last clause, ("for sins"); <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-6.htm">Hebrews 10:6</a>, "Whole burnt offerings, and <span class="accented">sacrifices</span> for sin;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, "No more offering for sin;" <a href="../../par/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2, 10</a>, "Propitiation for our sins;" <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>, "Died [or, 'suffered'] for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) sins, the righteous for (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>) the unrighteous." The last passage (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>) suggests the remark that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> is the more appropriate word before persons, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> before "sins." We find, however, that, in the Septuagint, in the Pentateuch <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> is used also before persons as it is in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-3.htm">Hebrews 5:3</a>; thus: <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-18.htm">Leviticus 5:18</a>, "The priest shall make atonement for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> him concerning (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>) his ignorance;" in both cases rendering the Hebrew <span class="accented">al.</span> So <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-20.htm">Leviticus 4:20, 26, 31, 35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-12.htm">Numbers 8:12</a>. On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30</a> we have "I will go up unto the Lord, that I may make atonement for (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, <span class="accented">b'ad</span>) your sin." The truth seems to be that <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, which is more properly "on behalf of" often denotes "for," equivalent to "on account of;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/39-11.htm">Psalm 39:11</a>, Septuagint, "rebukes for sin;" <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-20.htm">Ephesians 5:20</a>, "Giving thanks always for all things;" <a href="../../par/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>, "Glorify God for his mercy." And this sense passes into "concerning," "with reference to;" as <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>, "I would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-23.htm">2 Corinthians 8:23</a>, "Whether <span class="accented">any inquire</span> about Titus." On the other hand, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, which more properly denotes "concerning," "with reference to," passes into the sense of "on account of;" as <a href="../../par/luke/19-37.htm">Luke 19:37</a>, "Praise God for all the mighty works;" <a href="../../par/john/10-33.htm">John 10:33</a>, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-4.htm">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>, "I thank my God... concerning you;" <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a>, "We give thanks to God for you all;" <a href="../../par/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>, "I thank my God for [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>] you all." The use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in the verse before us, and in the similar passages above cited, no doubt followed its use in the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, which in the LXX. so commonly describes the "sin offering" of the Levitical institute. This phrase sometimes represents what in the Hebrew text is the simple noun (<span class="accented">chattath</span>) "sin," put for "sin offering;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-37.htm">Leviticus 7:37</a>, "This is the law ofthe burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering (<span class="accented">chattath</span>)," etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.). Sometimes it represents the same Hebrew noun preceded by the preposition <span class="accented">al</span>, for: "For the sin of such or such a one (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>);" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/leviticus/5.htm">Leviticus 5</a>:35, where the LXX. has, "The priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he hath sinned (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)." The precise force of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in this phrase was probably "on account of sin," or "having reference to sin;" senses of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> which, as has been seen, are borne by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> as well. This view of the force of these two prepositions, as employed in this relation, seems to the present writer more satisfactory than that which refers it to the notion of protection, "on behalf of" or "for the good of" some one; though it must unquestionably be allowed that this is a notion which they both of them frequently convey. To this latter notion, indeed, we must in all probability refer the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, "Gave himself up for me," as well as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 6</a>, for the unrighteous;" <a href="../../par/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19, 20</a>, "Given for you,"  "Poured out for you," and the like; and also that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>, "Shed for many;" <a href="../../par/john/17-9.htm">John 17:9</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> pray for them;" <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>, "Praying for us." The result of this inquiry into the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> with reference to these prepositions appears to be this: in what manner the death of Christ affected our condition in those respects in which that condition was antecedently qualified by our sins, neither <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> nor <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as prefixed to the noun "sins" enables us precisely to determine, further than as it recalls for illustration the "sin offering" of the Law. For the more complete development of the idea intended to be conveyed, we must look to other references made in Scripture to the subject, such as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>. Thus much, however, we may confidently assume: both <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> as so applied do alike warrant us in concluding, not only that it was because of our sins that Christ behoved to die, but also that his death is efficacious for the complete removal of those evils which accrue to us from our sins. That he might deliver us from this present  evil world (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>.

We are, therefore, naturally led to suppose that the apostle means to contrast the "world" here referred to with a "world to come;" which latter is mentioned in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-5.htm">Hebrews 6:5</a>, and seems synonymous with the "world [literally, 'inhabited earth'] to come," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, of <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>. Compare our Lord's words in <a href="../../par/matthew/12-32.htm">Matthew 12:32</a>, "Neither in this world nor in that which is to come," and his contrast of "this world" with "that world" in <a href="../../par/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a>. The Greek word here employed, <span class="accented">aion</span>, like <span class="accented">kosmos</span>, is used with varying shades of meaning. The two nouns, used interchangeably in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18, 19</a> are, however, not altogether equivalent. The former originally denotes a mode of time; the latter, a mode of space. In particular, <span class="accented">aion</span> is never used in the Greek Testament to denote "mankind," as <span class="accented">kosmos</span> not unfrequently is by all its writers. In the Syriac Version, <span class="accented">olmo</span> represents both <span class="accented">aion</span> and <span class="accented">kosmos</span> in all their senses, with a slight variation in its form to represent <span class="accented">aion</span> in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, "The course (<span class="accented">aida</span>) of this world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," as if it were "The worldliness of this world." Probably the same word <span class="accented">olmo</span>, in the Chaldean-Hebrew language current amongst the Palestinian Jews, was the term employed by them in all those connections in which either <span class="accented">aion</span> or <span class="accented">kosmos</span> would have been used by them if speaking in Hellenistic Greek; for it is to the Hellenistic dialect of the Greek language that both words as so employed belong. We never find <span class="accented">aion</span> at all in any of St. John's writings, except in the phrases, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, denoting "for ever." In other significations, when other writers of the New Testament might have used <span class="accented">aion</span>, St. John always puts <span class="accented">kosmos.</span> The word <span class="accented">aion</span>, denoting a cycle of time, is used also to signify a material world, as <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>; and, in particular, the state of things found existing in that cycle of time; and this as viewed in various aspects. In <a href="../../par/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34, 35</a> "this <span class="accented">aida"</span> contrasts the present state, as one of mortality and successive reproduction, with "that <span class="accented">aion</span>," viewed as one of immortality, in which processes of reproduction are found no more. But in <a href="../../par/luke/16-8.htm">Luke 16:8</a> "the children of this <span class="accented">aion"</span> are those who live after the world-loving, sinful fashion which characterizes mankind in general in contrast with "the children of light," who have been enlightened to recognize their relation to a spiritual world. In St. Paul, "the present <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> denotes the entire moral and spiritual state of mankind viewed in the aspect in which he contemplated it - a state wrapped in spiritual "darkness," pervaded by ungodliness and general immorality, and dominated by Satan; as Bengel puts it, "tota oeconomia peceati sub potestate Satanae" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>); a state from which Christians ought to study to get wholly weaned in all their moral and spiritual habits (<a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22-24</a>). In St. John, the phrases, "the world (<span class="accented">kosmos</span>)," or "this world" are frequently employed to express the same idea; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-11.htm">John 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/2-15.htm">1 John 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>. Out of this "power, empire, of darkness," in which by nature apart from Christ's grace all men are hopelessly enthralled; out of the grasp, inextricable by any efforts of their own, with which Satan holds them, - the apostle recognizes Christ as alone able to "rescue" us; and even him only able to "<span class="accented">rescue"</span> us by virtue of his atoning sacrifice of himself Thus, in an eminently just application of the verb, he is said to "redeem" (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) them from all iniquity, which expression includes, not only the idea of his paying down a ransom for their emancipation, but also the thought that, by the power of his grace, he makes the ransom effectual for the actual moral and spiritual deliverance, one by one, of those who believe in him: "he purifies them a people of his very own, devoted to good works" (<a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>). The position in the Greek of the epithet "evil," standing in a peculiar manner without the article after "this present world" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), is discussed both by Bishop Ellicott and by Bishop) Lightfoot in their respective Commentaries on the Epistle; the latter of whom takes it as equivalent to "<span class="accented">with</span> all its evils." It seems to the present writer that the syntax of the clause groups it with <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>," That which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made [or, 'done '] with hands (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>),<span class="accented">"</span> where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has no article, because it is a logical adjunct: the circumcision "which is made in the flesh with hands," is of course no real circumcision (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/2.htm">Romans 2</a>. fin.), and there-fore is only one so "called." So in the present passage the epithet "evil" is a logical adjunct: the state of the world being an "evil state," craved Christ's redemption,  and this fact should make that redemption welcome to us. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a> the epithet" handed from your fathers (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)," added after "your vain manner of life," is a logical adjunct: the fact that it was ancient and traditional gave it so strong a hold upon them as to crave the intervention of a no ordinary ransom to redeem them from it. With the turn of thought, which according to this view is indicated by the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> having been added to the noun without the article, agrees likewise the emphatic position of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> at the Lead of the sentence. Christ gave his own very self for this end, that he might <span class="accented">deliver</span> us out of this wretched state of things to which we belonged. But the reactionary movement now showing itself among the Galatians would inevitably, the apostle feels (see <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>), have the effect of making void this redeeming work of Christ, and of involving them afresh in their original misery. If we adhere to the reading in the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, we had best, perhaps, accept Winer's proposal ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 20, 1 <span class="accented">a</span>), and explain the absence of the article by supposing <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> as forming one notion, as in the case of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;</span>. in the Textus Receptus of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-3.htm">1 Corinthians 10:3</a>. But this reading, though grammatically it runs more smoothly than the other, is on that very account the less likely to have been the original one, and seems greatly to blunt the significance of the adjective. May we not detect in this epithet "evil" the sound of a sigh, drawn from the apostle's heart by this flesh worry and disappointment now cropping up for him and for all who cared for the success of the gospel? His feeling seems to be - Oh the weary evilness of this present state! When will it be brought to an end by the appearing of that blissful hope? (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-4.htm">2 Corinthians 5:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the will of God and our Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">according to the will of our God and Father. It is</span>, perhaps, of no great consequence whether we understand this clause as pointing to the whole preceding sentence, "Who gave himself...  world," or to the last clause of it, "That he might deliver...  world." But the former is the more probable construction: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> there is no reason for restricting it to the last words; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is in perfect accordance with the apostle's usual reference of Christ's coming into the world and dying for us to the Father's appointment, that he should here too be understood as referring to this work of delivering grace also. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The feeling apparently underlies these words of the apostle, that the Judaizing which he has now before his eyes was both setting itself in opposition to the supreme ordering of "our God" - and <span class="accented">his</span> sovereign "will" who of us shall dare to contravene?  - and also thwarting the operation of his <span class="accented">fatherly</span> loving-kindness. For the lack of filial confidence in God's love to us, and the slavish ceremonialism which characterized Judaical legalism, were both of them adjuncts of the unspiritual mind still in bondage to "the flesh" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>. and 8.), and therefore part and parcel of "this present world." Comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-3.htm">Galatians 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3, 8-10</a>; and <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>," Why, as living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, Handle not," etc.? As Professor Jowett observes, in this case as well as in the Epistle to the Romans, "The salutation is the proem of the whole Epistle." The expression, "<span class="accented">our</span> God and Father," is pathetic; it is an outcome of the deep complacency with which the apostle cherishes the assurance of God's fatherly love given us in the gospel - a sentiment of complacency stimulated into increased fervency by antagonism to the spiritual mischief confronting him. <span class="accented">Of our God and Father.</span> So Revised Version. This rendering appears decidedly preferable to that given by the Authorized Version, "of God and our Father," though grammatically this latter is confessedly not inadmissible.

This doxology is not introduced as merely a reverential closing up of the greeting, before the writer hastens on to the subsequent words of rebuke. It is rather an indignant tender of homage to the Most High, flashing forth from a loyal, filial heart; confronting and seeking, so far as it thus may, to redress the wrong done to "our God and Father" by the Judaizing spirit uprearing itself among the Galatians. It is similar in tone to the indignant doxology in <a href="../../par/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>. This view of its origin explains the fact that, as connected with a greeting, such doxology is found only in this of all St. Paul's Epistles. The indignation which pervades the tone of the whole passage favours the suppletion of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> rather than of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Perhaps, indeed <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is in general the more natural suppletion.

In like manner in the (most probably interpolated) doxology at the close of the Lord's prayer in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>, "For thine is the kingdom," etc., the <span class="accented">ascription</span> of praise is not so much expressed as implied. Viewed in themselves, the words simply state the truth which constitutes the ground for our addressing to "our Father" our praises and our petitions. The article is most commonly prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> in such ascriptions of praise, whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> stands alone, as <a href="../../par/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-27.htm">Romans 16:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-21.htm">Ephesians 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-20.htm">Philippians 4:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-21.htm">Hebrews 13:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-18.htm">2 Peter 3:18</a>; or in conjunction with other nouns, as <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/7-12.htm">Revelation 7:12</a>.

As he reflects on the case, whatever feeling of resentment mingled with his surprise turns off upon the pseudo-evangelists misleading them; and accordingly it is upon these that his anathema is pronounced, not upon <span class="accented">them</span> at all (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9, 12</a>). They, indeed, by listening to the false teaching, were in danger of falling from grace; but this he rather compassionates than angrily denounces. <span class="cmt_word">That ye are so soon removed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye are so quickly falling away.</span> This "quickly" has been taken by many as meaning "so soon after ye were called," and as consequently furnishing some ground for determining the time of the writing of the Epistle. But the comparison of the use of the same adverb (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, "Be not quickly shaken;" and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>, "Lay hands hastily on no man," suggests rather the meaning, "so quickly upon being solicited thereto." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to transfer one's self to a different course of thinking, acting, partisanship (cf. Liddell and Scott, 'Lexicon'), is used both in an unfavourable and in a good sense. Thus 2 Macc. 7:24, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> "If he would give over following the laws of his country;" Appian, 'Bell. Mithr.,' 41: "Falling away, going over, from (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) Archelaus to Sylla;" Jamblich, 'Protrept,' 17, "Change from (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) a restless and profligate mode of life to an orderly one." The verb, being in the present tense, and not in the aorist or the perfect, suggests the idea of an action in its commencing stage, and not yet fully consummated; as Chrysostom observes: "That is, 'I do not yet believe nor suppose that the delusion has got to be complete' - the language of one who will fain win them back." <span class="cmt_word">From him that called you into the grace of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">from him that called you w be in the grace of Christ.</span> The phrase, "he that called you," recites the personality of "our God and Father," spoken of in vers. 3, 4. The calling of man into the kingdom of God is habitually ascribed by St. Paul to the First Person in the Trinity (cf. ver. 15; <a href="../../par/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-24.htm">Romans 9:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>). God's name is omitted, as in ver. 15 (where it is wanting in the more recent texts), and <a href="../../par/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>, "For he that wrought for Peter." The apostle impressively, even startlingly, describes their defection from the truth of the gospel as no other than a defection from God himself; similarly to the strain of language pursued in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-15</a>. "The grace of Christ" recites the state of acceptance with God into which Christians are brought by Christ through faith in him. So <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>. "Fallen  away from grace;" <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>, "Through whom we have also had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand." The genitive, "of Christ," denotes the Author, as in" the peace of God" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>); "righteousness of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-21.htm">Romans 3:21</a>, etc.). There is a pathos in the word "grace," as referring to the sweet gentleness of Christ's yoke as contrasted with the yoke of ceremonial-ism which the Galatians were so foolishly hankering after. The construction, "Called you in the grace of Christ," is similar to "Called us in peace" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>); "Ye were called in one hope of your calling" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>); "Called us... in sanctification" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>). The verb "call," implying as it does the bringing into a certain state, suggests the sense here given to the clause, in preference to our taking it as meaning "called you by the grace of Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Unto another gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">unto another</span> (or, <span class="accented">a new</span>) <span class="accented">sort of gospel.</span> The adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, as contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span> used in the next verse, appears to intimate the changed quality of the object, its strange new-fangled character. The adjective does sometimes take this shade of meaning. Thus <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "By men of strange tongues, and by lips of strangers;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-4.htm">2 Corinthians 11:4</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>," Different spirit...  different gospel;" <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "Teach a different doctrine." The reader will find a brief but instructive description of the difference at times observable between <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in Bishop Lightfoot's note on the passage; who cites the Septuagint rendering in <a href="../../par/exodus/1-8.htm">Exodus 1:8</a> of the Hebrew "new king," which it gives <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3c2;</span>: and a passage in Xenophon's 'Cyclopaedia,' 8:3, 8, "If you accuse me... another time when I serve you...  you will find me (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>) another sort of attendant." The phrase, "another sort of gospel," so far as giving the new form of doctrine the title of "gospel" at all, is paradoxical and sarcastic. The paradox is corrected in what follows. The substantive, "gospel." is borrowed, not without a tinge of irony, from the pretensions of the innovators; they, of course, would be ready to designate their mangled form of Christian doctrine as still "the gospel." The epithet which the apostle adds gives his own view of its character. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which is not another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;</span>). Already, in these very words, the apostle means to assert that essential unalterableness of the gospel, which, with solemn emphasis, he in the two following verses more fully affirms. Thus much seems plain. But, owing probably to the impassioned eagerness of the moment, he here, as not unfrequently elsewhere from the like cause, expresses himself in language, the grammatical analysis of which is obscure and in some degree uncertain. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the relative "which" may be taken as reciting the term "gospel" only, that is, the gospel which is properly so called; in which case we may read the sentence thus: "But the gospel is not ['never can be] other" - other, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> than it is as already preached to you; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the relative may recite the "other [or, 'new'] sort of gospel" of ver. 6; and then we should have "But this other-fashioned gospel is not another gospel really," or, "is not the real gospel reappearing in another form." The former method presents undoubtedly, of the two, the harsher way of construing; but constructions as harsh do occasionally present themselves in the apostle's style when writing under strong emotion. The exact analysis, however, is merely a matter of grammatical nicety; the substance of the thought is quite clear. <span class="cmt_word">But there be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="accented">...</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">only there are.</span> This construction, of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> followed by a finite verb, is found also in <a href="../../par/mark/6-5.htm">Mark 6:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>, "Save that...  he healed them." The force of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;</span>, "except," in this passage as well as in some others, may be described as <span class="accented">partially exceptive</span>; that is, it denotes an exception taken, not to the entire foregoing sentence, but to part of it only. Thus in <a href="../../par/luke/4-27.htm">Luke 4:27</a>, "There were many lepers in Israel... and none of them was cleansed, save Naaman the syrian:" where the pronoun "them" recites the "lepers in Israel," but the "save" refers to "lepers" only; <a href="../../par/revelation/9-4.htm">Revelation 9:4</a>, "That they should not hurt the grass, neither any green thing, neither any tree, save the men who," etc.: where the "save" points back only to the words, "that they should not hurt;" so again <a href="../../par/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>, "Save they which are written in the Lamb's book of life," points back only to the words, "there shall in no wise enter into it." In all such cases the rendering "only" or "but only" would exhibit just the amount of exception which appears intended. In the present instance the most probable explanation is this: the gospel can never be ether than it is; except that among (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> only among) those who proclaim it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> profess to proclaim it) there are some who so misrepresent its import as to completely reverse its character. <span class="cmt_word">There be some that trouble you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">there are certain who are disquieting you.</span> The form of expression is the same as in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, "Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you." The sentence as it stands differs from the supposable substitute, "certain persons are disquieting you," by directing attention me, re to the <span class="accented">persons</span> referred to than merely to their <span class="accented">action</span> viewed in itself; it marks them out as  meriting strong censure, or (in Colossians, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) as persons to be carefully guarded against. Who these troublers were and where they came from is uncertain (see note on ver. 2). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> frequently means "to alarm" or "disquiet," as <a href="../../par/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/14-26.htm">Matthew 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-12.htm">Luke 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-38.htm">Luke 24:38</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-14.htm">1 Peter 3:14</a>. And this is probably the sense in which it is used here and in the similar passages, <a href="../../par/galatians/5-10.htm">Galatians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-24.htm">Acts 15:24</a>. It describes the action of those who came to believers reposing in a sense of acceptance with God through Christ; and filled their minds with uneasiness and apprehension, by telling them that they were not safe as they were, but must do something else if they wished to really possess the Divine favour. Others, however, connect the verb with the notion of civil disturbance, as in <a href="../../par/acts/17-8.htm">Acts 17:8</a>, and thus with raising seditions and shaking men's allegiance, in conformity with the metaphor of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 6. <span class="cmt_word">And would pervert the gospel of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">and would fain turn into its clean contrary the gospel of Christ.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is an appropriate one to use with reference to such a misrepresentation of the gospel as the one now in the apostle's view; for this converted it from a doctrine of emancipation into a doctrine of renewed bondage (comp. ch. 5:1-4). So the verb is used in the only other passages in which it is found in the New Testament, <a href="../../par/acts/2-20.htm">Acts 2:20</a>, "The sun shall be turned into darkness;" <a href="../../par/james/4-9.htm">James 4:9</a>, "Let your laughter be turned into mourning." So in Sirach 11:31, "Turning good things into evil." Liddell and Scott ('Lexicon') cite <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>   =   "<span class="accented">contrariwise</span>," Plato, 'Gorg.,' 456 E; 'Rep' 587, D. In the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the addition of the genitive, "of Christ," with the twofold article, marks the words with a stately emphasis. It was no less than THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST that these men were tampering with. "The gospel of Christ" means here the gospel of which Christ is the Author, as in "the gospel of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>). and which he had sent forth his apostles to proclaim. The peculiar emphasis and the connection forbid our taking the genitive as denoting merely the subject-matter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But though we</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but even if we ourselves.</span> This "but" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span>) is strongly adversative. What those disturbers of the believer's peace would have been fain to do was a thing impossible. Heaven's gospel <span class="accented">could</span> not be thus changed. And the attempt to thus change it, being in effect to fight against God, merited God's curse. In the plural "we" the apostle intends principally his own self. A shrinking from unnecessary self-obtrusion, and tender respectful sympathy with his ministerial brethren, prompt him not unfrequently to veil his own individuality by associating in this way with himself those who were wont to share more or less in his evangelistic labours and sufferings, although in reality what he says may apply principally to himself and only in a very modified measure to <span class="accented">them.</span> A signal instance of this is furnished by that whole passage in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which begins with the fourth chapter and goes on down to the eleventh verse of the sixth. Nevertheless, we should in all such cases imperfectly represent the spirit of his words, if we were to substitute the singular pronoun "I." In the present instance individuals of the evangelizing party which were wont to accompany him had, no doubt, been fellow-workers with him also in Galatia, and are therefore here inclusively referred to. Compare the plural and the singular verbs in the next verse. The introduction of this reference to himself and his fellow-workers, as well as that to "an angel from heaven," seems meant to make his readers feel that this was no question of distinguished personality, as if it mattered <span class="accented">who</span> it was that taught a different doctrine; whether (suppose) it were a James or a Cephas, for those revered names were often used to cloak the designs of Judaizers; or whether it was one of the Galatian Churchmen themselves especially looked up to (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-10.htm">Galatians 5:10</a> and note). An anathema was his due, whoever he might be. In the manner of its introduction we cannot fail to recognize an underlying consciousness on the writer's part of the highly distinguished position which he himself held; but there is present the consciousness too that he was nothing more than the mere organ or channel of Christ's teaching; from that teaching he himself may not swerve without justly incurring the "woe" which he told the Corinthians he should have to fear in case he preached not the gospel (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-16.htm">1 Corinthians 9:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">or if an angel from heaven should set himself to preach unto you a gospel other than that we preached unto you.</span> The construction of the entire sentence displays in the Greek a broken character not quite so apparent in our Authorized Version. The verb "should preach a gospel" is in the singular number (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); neglecting the "we," it attaches itself to "an angel from heaven," which latter, as being the higher, absorbs the previously named subject altogether, standing as sole subject, both in the hypothetical clause and in the concluding one, "let him be anathema." It is, of course, apparent that, if the sentence of anathema would in the  supposed case be the only proper one to pronounce upon "an angel from heaven," it most certainly fastens upon any human being guilty of the same offence. The "angel from heaven" is like the "second man from heaven" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-47.htm">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>; the phrase," from heaven," denoting both coming down out of heaven and also the higher sphere of being to which the person spoken of appertains. Comp. also <a href="../../par/john/3-31.htm">John 3:31</a>, "He that is from earth...  he that is from heaven." The force of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> may he illustrated by its use in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-11.htm">1 Corinthians 3:11</a>, "Other foundation can no man lay than (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) that which is laid;" where it points to a new foundation, not to be by the side of, but to supersede, the former one. Taken thus, it would seem to follow up the before expressed notion of" another gospel" superseding, setting aside, the true gospel. This sense of the preposition readily passes on to that of "contrary to." which is profusely illustrated by Liddell and Scott ('Lexicon,' <span class="accented">in verb.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, c. I. 1:4, b), and which we have in <span class="accented">Acts</span> 18:13, "<span class="accented">Worship</span> God <span class="accented">contrary to</span> the Law [of Moses];" <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>," Causing the divisions...  <span class="accented">contrary to</span> the doctrine which ye learned;" <a href="../../par/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>, "use which is <span class="accented">against</span> nature." It cannot be doubted that the apostle is here thinking of a (pretended) gospel which was incompatible with the true one, and not of merely additional elements of Christian doctrine which should take their place alongside of those which they had already received. Additional information, we may be sure, was quite as necessary or desirable for the Galatians as it was for either the Corinthians or the "Hebrews;" neither of whom had as yet, as was intimated to them (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/6.htm">Hebrews 6</a>. l), been fed with "solid food," but only with "milk," and whom it behoved to "go on to fuller maturity" of knowledge. The point in the apostle's view was this: what he had himself taught them was, <span class="accented">so far</span>, certainly true and to be depended upon, and could not without treason against Christ be set aside or superseded or essentially qualified; whereas the teaching which was now being foisted upon their previous convictions <span class="accented">did</span> infringe upon what he had taught them, seriously and even fundamentally. The tenor of the whole Epistle shows what were the especial features of this gospel which were now in question. The present question concerned the "good news" that God, through the cross of Christ, had emancipated his servants from bondage to ceremonialism; that God adopted them as simply believing in Christ to be his sons in full possession of his fatherly love; and that by the Holy Spirit he endued them with the consciousness of this adoption. There has been at times much discussion as to the bearing of the passage before us upon our controversy with Romanists respecting tradition. If what has been above stated is just, it follows that these words of the apostle forbid our adding, <span class="accented">on any ground whatever</span>, to the dogma or Church practice sanctioned by Scripture, any such dogma or Church practice as would transform or essentially modify the former, but, on the other hand, the addition of dogma or Church practice which is not out of harmony with that sanctioned by Scripture, these words do not forbid. <span class="cmt_word">Let him be accursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">let him be anathema</span>, that <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="accented">a thing doomed to destruction.</span> The word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is originally identical with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> (<span class="accented">anathema</span>), a thing devoted, which in <a href="../../par/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5</a> is rendered "offering;" but in Hellenistic Greek the former diverges from the latter by being ordinarily applied to "<span class="accented">a</span> thing devoted to destruction." In all languages it sometimes occurs that a word, one and the same originally, diverges into two slightly differing forms, used severally to express different phases of the original notion. Archbishop Trench, in his 'Study of Words,' p. 156, referred to by Bishop Lightfoot in his note on this passage, instances "cant" and "chant," "human" and "humane," and others. In the LXX. <span class="accented">anathema is</span> used to render the Hebrew word <span class="accented">cherem</span>, which in our Authorized Version is translated "cursed" or "accursed thing." Living things that were <span class="accented">cherem</span> were to be put to death; inanimate objects that were <span class="accented">cherem</span> were to be destroyed. Thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. directions are given as to what was to be done in the case of an Israelite city which should have given itself to idolatry: the inhabitants and the cattle thereof were to be smitten with the edge of the sword; and the spoil of the city was to be brought together and burned, and the city itself" to be a heap for ever, never to be built again." And then (ver. 18), "There shall cleave nought of the cursed [or, 'devoted'] thing (<span class="accented">cherem</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) to thine hand." Similarly, in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">Deuteronomy 7:26</a>, of the idols and the silver or gold on them, of the Canaanites, "Thou shalt not take it unto thee, neither shalt thou bring an abomination unto thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing ['be <span class="accented">cherem</span>,' or 'be <span class="accented">anathema</span>,' <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>] like it; but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>)." See also ibid., vers. 23-25; <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>, "The city shall be accursed [or, ' devoted;<span class="accented"> cherem</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>], and all that are therein; only Rahab the harlot shall live;" <a href="../../par/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 12</a>. In the New Testament <span class="accented">anathema</span> occurs in four other passages. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-3.htm">1 Corinthians 12:3</a>, "No man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema."  Here the apostle, no doubt, refers to the manner in which the unbelieving Jews allowed themselves, already then, to speak of our Lord. Clearly they meant thereby more than merely "excommunicate," which palliated sense some have endeavoured to give to "anathema;" they cannot be supposed to have intended less than an object which merited that utter extinction to which he who was <span class="accented">cherem</span> was under the Law doomed: their blaspheming thought, no doubt, taking into its view not this world only, but that also which is to come. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, "I could pray that I myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren's sake." The reader naturally casts about to find some qualification to give to an utterance which seems at first sight to express a wish such as one who loved Christ so ardently as Paul did could not possibly have entertained. Yet the' words, "anathema from Christ," can mean nothing less than being separated from Christ by a curse consigning him to perdition. The desiderated qualification must be sought in the phrase, "I could pray;" this renders an imperfect verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), which expresses a turn of thought similar to that denoted in the (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), "I could wish," of <a href="../../par/galatians/4-20.htm">Galatians 4:20</a>, on which see note. In each case the tense betokens a mere glance (so to speak) of wish which is instantly withdrawn. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, "If any man loveth not the Lord, let him be anathema." Here, too, the notion of Church excommunication, whether by formal exclusion or by the withdrawal of brotherly recognition, is not satisfactory. The Israelite notion of being anathema, <span class="accented">cherem</span>, points to a no mere negation, but to a condition of positive accursedness linked with exposure to utter destruction. Moreover the apostle refers to a man's interior sentiments with respect to Christ - a matter not within the cognisance of human judgments. Who can in many cases, or perhaps in any, determine whether another loves Christ or not? It is in truth a warning against a soul's disloyalty to the Lord Jesus, clothing itself in the form of an execration - an execration which, it is true, is an impetuous flashing forth of the apostle's own flaming sense of what is due to Christ from every human being, but which is nowise chargeable with extravagance. Its perfect justness, as well as the verification which awaits it in the future judgment, is evinced, as by other considerations, so also by our Lord's own words in <a href="../../par/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41-46</a>. <p><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> <a href="../../par/acts/23-14.htm">Acts 23:14</a>, "We have bound ourselves under a great curse;" literally, "We have anathematized [or, 'solemnly bound'] ourselves with anathema (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>)." They had sat, I, no doubt, some such words as these: "May we be anathema if we taste aught till we have killed Paul!" with which we may conjoin <a href="../../par/mark/14-71.htm">Mark 14:71</a>, "He began to pronounce a curse (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) and to swear" - not, to be sure, pronouncing a curse upon Jesus, but wishing himself to be anathema if he knew that Man. There can be little doubt that the anathema in both these cases involved a reference to eternal perdition. That no less is intended by the term in the present verse and, therefore, also in that next to it, is further proved by reference to the hypothetical "angel from heaven" who should be found preaching a different gospel. Being anathema must involve for such a one excision from the kingdom of light, together with whatever destruction properly attends thereupon. What, it will be asked, is the precise force of the "let him be," both here and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>? It cannot denote less than a complacent satisfied acquiescence. The apostle-prophet not only foresees that, at the final judgment, such will be the doom of the wilful perverter of the gospel, but foresees it with a mind at one with the Judge who shall pronounce it; he can himself desire, he does desire, no ether. It is his loyal sympathy with Christ as Saviour, as caring for the souls of men, that prompts him to proclaim aloud for the warning of the false teachers themselves as well as for the warning of those inclined to hearken to their false teaching, his own solemn <span class="accented">Amen</span> to the terrible sentence awaiting them. But if so, why not allow the imperative its full force, and understand the utterance as an imperative? It is granted that the apostle was apt at times to be carried away by the fervid impetuosity of his feelings, even when writing, to the utterance of words which in calmer mood he would be ready to a certain extent to retract. We have a clear example of such retractation in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4, 5</a> (see note below on Galatians 5:12). But, in the case before us, that the vehemence of the apostle's language is a deliberate vehemence, and no mere momentary outburst of excited feeling, is proved by the solemn measured iteration in the next verse. And if we suppose, what seems to be most probable, that that verse refers to a similar denunciation uttered among the Galatians a good while before, the proof is all the stronger that his language is no sudden exorbitancy of passionate emotion, but expresses an abiding sentiment. We are to remember that it is the very substance of the gospel which the apostle feels to be assailed. The gospel, he knew, both by inspired insight and by his own experience, to be "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth. "Of this gospel Christ had himself declared that "he that believed it should  be saved, and he that disbelieved it should be condemned" (<a href="../../par/mark/16-16.htm">Mark 16:16</a>). Wherein does "being anathema" differ from "being condemned"? And if the disbelieving "shall be condemned," can a less guiltiness be supposed to attach to one who not only disbelieved the gospel himself, but was also plucking it out of the hearts of others and palming off upon them instead a false gospel which was no salvation? "But could St. Paul, being such a lover of souls as he was, imprecate a doom of perdition to fall upon any soul of man?" Absolutely, we may say he could not; but conditionally, he might, and that in perfect consistency with his usual habits of feeling - conditionally, on the supposition, that is, that the sin was not repented of and forsaken. It was his very love of souls that would impel him thus to speak, not only on behalf of the souls which the bringer-in of a false doctrine might destroy, but on behalf of the deceiver's own self. He pronounces the doom in order to deter and thus save. We have to remember, too, that the apostle is not, at the dictate of his own passionate zeal for the truth, constituting either a new sin or a new measure of penalty. He simply, as prophet and apostle, utters forth the mind of him who is Lawgiver and Judge. This last consideration suggests the limits within which only can the apostle's action in this matter be regarded as an example for imitation. It is lawful to us to recite, as the Church of England speaks in her Commination Office: "the general sentences of God's cursing against impenitent sinners gathered out of Scripture" - and by "general sentences" we are to understand sentences pronounced upon classes of offenders, not sentences upon individual persons, to whom we may conjecture them to be applicable. It is lawful also to us individually and right, that we should add to the utterance of each sentence our hearty "Amen," and thus take part with God and his Law, not only against sins committed by our neighbours, but most especially and above all against wilful transgressions of our own. But beyond this, none who are <span class="accented">not special organs of inspiration</span> may venture to go, whether acting individually or in any corporate capacity. An anathema is a bolt of doom such as the Almighty alone can fashion or make operative; and we are invading the Divine prerogative and working mischief and peril for ourselves if, on the one hand, we venture to enlarge and make more specific than he has done his "general sentences of cursing," or, on the other, dilute the force of these solemn warnings of his, and treat them with disregard.

In this latter passage, the perfect, "I have said beforehand," points to the time indicated in the words," as when I was present the second time." The resemblance between the two passages, notwithstanding the somewhat different senses in which the verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) is used in them, suggests the view that here likewise in the first clause the verb refers to some former occasion on which the apostle was personally present with those he is writing to. The Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>), "say before," is sometimes equivalent to "forewarn," as <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-21.htm">Galatians 5:21</a>; and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-2.htm">2 Corinthians 13:2</a> (twice). Sometimes it means "say on a former occasion," as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3</a>, and most probably here. The first clause has by some been supposed to refer to the preceding verse. But recent critics generally agree in feeling that both the verb "we have said before" and the adverb "now" suggest the sense of a wider interval of time. The use of the verb in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a> has been cited on behalf of the other view. But even if the somewhat doubtful idea be admitted that <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-3.htm">2 Corinthians 7:3</a> points back to the twelfth verso of the preceding chapter, it would still fail to furnish an adequate parallel. For not only is it parted from the earlier passage by the number of verses which intervene, but also by a succession of varying moods of feeling and diverse styles of address. Account has to be taken of the change of number between "we have said before" and "I am saying again." The only probable explanation is that the "we" recites the same persons as in the words "we preached" in ver. 8; whereas Paul, as now writing (probably) with his own hand, presents himself individually as reiterating that solemn affirmation. The words, "now also I am saying again," as marking a time contrasted with that earlier one referred to, contemplate the asseveration made in the eighth verso as well as in this. In the "now" the apostle indicates, not so much the moment of his writing, as the just then subsisting juncture of circumstances in Galatia, which called for the renewal of his commination. Its earlier utterance referred to may have occurred either in the second visit to Galatia, mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>, or in the first, mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. When taking leave of his disciples on either occasion he may have been led to thus emphatically insist upon the sacred, inviolable character of the gospel, by his observation   on the one hand of the fickleness and impressionableness which characterized this people, and on the other by the frequency with which perversions of Christian doctrine were already seen to be infesting the Churches. Compare also the apostle's warning to the Ephesians (<a href="../../par/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">if any man is preaching unto you a gospel other than that which ye received</span>, <span class="accented">let him be anathema.</span> The verbal variations in these words, as compared with those in ver. 8, are slight. One, however, deserves attention: "If any one <span class="accented">is preaching"</span> compared with "If... an angel <span class="accented">should</span>...  <span class="accented">preach."</span> By this change in the form of making the supposition, the denunciation seems to come down out of the region of bare hypothesis to that of, perhaps, present reality. If so, the thunder of the apostle's anathema would be felt by his readers approaching nearer and nearer to the head of seine particular individual among themselves, towards whom their eyes would at once be directed with the feeling that it was, perhaps, <span class="accented">his</span> doom that the apostle was now pronouncing. The construction in the Greek of the verb "preach the gospel" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), with the accusative of the person to whom the message is brought, is found also in <a href="../../par/acts/13-32.htm">Acts 13:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-21.htm">Acts 14:21</a>. In sense there seems to be no appreciable difference between this construction of the verb and that with the dative as found in the preceding verse and often. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For do I now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>); <span class="accented">for at this hour.</span> This "for" points back either to the fact of the apostle's having now so solemnly pronounced afresh the awful anathema which at some former time he had uttered; or which, in effect, is nearly the same thing, to the tone of feeling which he in so doing evinced, and to his method of apostolic action which he therein exemplified. The adverb <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, as used in the New Testament, is distinguished from the more common "now" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>), as denoting that space of time which is most closely present. This shade of meaning is conspicuous, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the "Suffer it to be so just now" of <a href="../../par/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>, that is, during that brief, quickly vanishing moment in which the Messiah was by Divine appointment to appear subordinate in position to his forerunner. So <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>, "Thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) at this very moment send me more than twelve legions of angels?" <a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12</a>, "Ye cannot bear them (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) just now;" in a very short while they would be enabled to bear them. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>, "Just now (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) we see in a mirror, darkly;" words written under a vivid sense of how brief the interval is which separates the present state of things from that of the life to come. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>, "On whom, though just now (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) ye see him not " - another outcome of the same feeling. Similarly, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-7.htm">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "until this very hour;" and, on the other side of the point of time indicated <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is "from this very hour" in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-42.htm">John 4:42</a>. Many have supposed that the apostle is speaking of certain characteristics of his present course of behaviour as a believer and a servant of Christ, viewed in contrast with the life which he had once lived when an ardent disciple of Judaism. But the narrowly restrictive form of the adverb resists this interpretation, he could hardly with this reference in view have used the phrase "just now," or "at this very hour," of a tenor of life which he had been pursuing for now more than twenty years. Some eminent critics (Alford, Ellicott, Lightfoot, Sanday) take this <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> as pointing to the style of language which the apostle is "just now" adopting: "Now, when I use such uncompromising language;" or, "There! is that the language of a man-pleaser? <span class="accented">Now</span> do I," etc. It is an objection to this view that it gives the adverb a somewhat diverse sense to that which it bears in ver. 9; for whereas in ver. 9 <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, points to the circumstances of the present hour as prompting the apostle to the utterance of his anathema, according to the view referred to it here points to the present hour as exhibiting the <span class="accented">apostle himself</span> in a certain aspect. It is more obvious, and indeed gives the present use of the adverb more force, to take it in both verses with the like reference. In both the apostle refers to the present hour as a juncture in which he felt that it had become necessary to depart from his customary manner of using a winning style of address. At other times he will persuade and please; <span class="accented">just now</span> he cannot. <span class="cmt_word">Persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men</span>? (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">do I persuade men or God</span>? <span class="accented">or do I seek to please</span> men? Expositors have endeavoured to establish, as one sense of the Greek verb rendered "persuade," that of "making So-and-so one's friend." No doubt it often means to prevail, or endeavour to prevail, upon others, by coaxing, persuasion, bribery, or anyhow, to go along with you in some particular course of thinking or acting indicated by the context; but it can nowhere. be shown to mean, when standing alone, "to win So-and-so's friendship." In <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>, "Having persuaded Blastus" means "Having got Blastus to concur with them." Similarly, <a href="../../par/matthew/28-14.htm">Matthew 28:14</a>, "We will persuade him," and 2 Macc. 4:45, "With a view to  persuade the king." The verb is used here, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, "Knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade men." In that passage the apostle states it to be his practice to make use of all means of persuasion in order to induce men to accept the gospel message (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>, "Working together with him, we intreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain"). He was not content with merely, as an ambassador, delivering the message and there leaving the matter; but made it his anxious concern to gain for the message acceptance, by the use of arguments addressed to the reason, and appeals addressed to the feelings, by putting himself, as it were, by the side of those he was addressing as one who sympathized to a large extent with their ways of thought, for the purpose of conducting them onward to concurrence with more perfect views. Among many examples which might be cited, illustrating his skill in persuasion, it will suffice to refer to the manner in which he dealt with the Athenians, with the Jews when speaking to them from the stairs, with King Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1-21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-2.htm">Acts 26:2, 3, 26, 27</a>), and to his Epistle to Philemon. Another feature, closely connected with the one now mentioned, and here likewise referred to, is the care which the apostle took to "please men;" such a care as produced a manner towards his fellow-men far exceeding the courtesy and shows of respectful consideration which the law of charity ordinarily prescribes. For example, instead of thrusting forward into notice, as the spirit of unsympathetic pride naturally prompts us to do, the points on which he differed from others, and in reference to which he <span class="accented">knew</span> himself to he standing on higher ground than they, he chose rather to make prominent any points of agreement which he could find already subsisting, conciliating their candid interest by thus fraternally putting himself on a level with them. If this did not suffice for the purpose of enlisting their sympathies on behalf of himself and his views, he did not hesitate, in matters morally indifferent, to mortify and snub his own tastes, and forego the dissenting judgments of his. own superior enlightenment, "to buffet his body, as he expresses himself in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>, "and bring it into bondage," by following, how ever distasteful to himself, such practices as should get those whose spiritual improvement he was seeking, to feel, so to speak, comfortably at home with himself. In writing to the Corinthians the apostle in one passage (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-23</a>) dwells at stone length upon this feature of his ministerial conduct, not ashamed of it, but manifestly glorying in it as a triumph of Christ's grace in his soul. Presently after, at the close of the following chapter, he distinctly propounds himself, as in this respect a Christ-like pattern, for their imitation, "Even [he writes] as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved: be ye imitators of me, even as! also am of Christ." Both of these strongly marked features of his ministerial character were liable to he misunderstood, and by his detractors could be easily misconstrued as grave faults, he was, in fact, accused of speciousness and insincerity, of double faced dealings, of simulation and dissimulation. We can easily understand how readily such accusations would be set on foot, and holy colourable they could be made to appear. That they painfully affected the apostle's mind is evidenced by the frequency of the references he makes to them, and by the earnestness and deep pathos of feeling which not seldom mark those references. It is to such sinister criticism that he alludes, when in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, cited above, after saying, "we persuade men," he adds, "but we are become manifest unto God," meaning that, though he did make a habit of laying himself out to persuade, yet the entire sincerity of his action, however misconstrued by men, was patent to the Divine eye (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>). Now, we have reason to believe that the apostle had been apprised, or at least that he suspected, that in Galatia also such misrepresentation of these characteristics of his ministry was rife. The Epistle supplies at least one token of such having probably been the case, We gather from <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a> that he had been said to be still "preaching circumcision." They who said this did so apparently in the sense that his having hitherto kept back this point of his doctrine in preaching to them was only an artifice of "persuasion;" that, in order to prevail upon them to accept the Christian faith, he had thought it expedient not at first to press upon them the observances of Judaism, while nevertheless he knew them to be necessary and was prepared by-and-by to insist upon their being attended to. St. Paul is conscious, therefore, of the existence on the part of some of the Galatian Churchmen of unfriendly suspicions with regard to his straightforwardness and uprightness. It is this stinging consciousness that occasions both the substance and the sharp abrupt tone of what he here says. The substance of the verse may be paraphrased thus: "I have written decisively and sternly; for at such a critical juncture as the present is it men that I can make it my business to 'persuade,' as they sneeringly but not un-truly say I love to do? or is it God that I care, so to speak, to persuade, to wit of my  fidelity to the gospel which he has committed to my trust? They scoffingly say I love to 'please men;' and I thank God I have been wont to 'please men' to the very utmost of my power for their good; but is it my work just now to be pleasing men by ways of sweet tenderness and forbearance? If at this time I were still laying myself out to 'please men,' these men, to wit, who are making havoc of the gospel message, and you who are ignorantly listening to them,  - then were I no true servant of Christ." The interrogative form into which the apostle's language suddenly breaks is apparently, here also as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-1.htm">2 Corinthians 3:1</a>, due to his that moment bethinking himself of those malicious censurers of him. We have here an example of the form of sentence which the grammarians call zeugma; that is to say, "God" is named in conjunction with "men," as an object to the action of the verb "persuade," whereas this verb, suitable enough with relation to men, can only by a strain upon its proper sense be employed with relation to God. The sentence would possibly have expressed what appears to have been the apostle's real meaning with less ruggedness, but certainly with less intensity, if its second clause had been (perhaps), "or commend myself to God's approval? (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>;)." (For other instances of zeugma, see <a href="../../par/luke/1-64.htm">Luke 1:64</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-2.htm">1 Corinthians 3:2</a>.) The addition of the article before <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, while it is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, gives the noun a more grandiose tone, as if it were, "Do I persuade men or GOD?" <span class="cmt_word">For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">if I still were pleasing men</span>, <span class="accented">I were no servant</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">bondserrant</span>) <span class="accented">of Christ's.</span> The received text of the Greek has "For if I still (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>);" but the "for" is omitted by recent editors. It makes no difference in the sense whether we retain it or not, for, retaining the "for," we should have to understand before it, "I trow not," or the like. The word "bondservant" here expresses the official relation of a Christian minister, one especially at his Divine Owner's beck and call. So <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-1.htm">Titus 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>. The apostle means, "I were no servant of Christ in spirit and reality, whatever I might call myself." A good many expositors suppose the "still" to be said with reference to the time before the apostle's conversion: "I were no apostle or Christian at all." But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> there is no indication either in this passage or anywhere that the apostle regarded his life before his conversion as characterized by the desire to please men; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with the sense thus given to it, the thought, as Meyer observes, seems excessively tame; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as thus explained, it would not harmonize with the apostle's explicit and repeated declaration that, in the discharge of his high office, he did make a point of pleasing men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I certify you, brethren</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>) <span class="accented">now</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">I make known unto you</span>, <span class="accented">brethren.</span> The external evidence, as well as the judgment of critics, is so evenly divided between the two readings, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>, that the decision as to which is to be preferred seems to lie with exegesis rather than with <span class="accented">diplomatic</span> criticism. On the one hand, the fact that the gospel which the apostle had delivered to the Galatians came to him by a direct revelation from Christ, would be properly viewed as a reason for regarding it as sacred and inviolable. Viewed thus, the reading, "now I make known to you," appears justified as introducing a plea warranting the anathema of vers. 8, 9. On the other hand, there is a difference of tone perceptible between the previous context, which is strongly marked, as we have seen, by intense excitement of feeling, and the passage which commences with this verse. The relaxation in the latter of the stern, indignant severity of the former is indicated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the phrase, "I make known unto you," which, as well as the equivalent phrase, "I would not have you ignorant (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>)," is with the apostle a customary prelude to a context of deliberate and measured statement; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the introduction of the word "brethren," even though, perhaps, holding the position in the sentence which it does here, this compellation has not the same pathetic affectionateness as marks it when heading a sentence; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the strain of quiet narration which the apostle now enters upon. This change in the tone is somewhat adverse to the supposition that the two passages were, as originally written, linked together by the closely connective "for." It suggests to the careful reader the feeling that, after the apostle had somewhat relieved his spirit of the indignant excitement with which he at first addressed himself to the writing of the letter, he laid down his pen at the end of the tenth verse, which had introduced a topic of thought that threatened to lead him aside from his present business; and, after pausing to re fleet how he had best proceed, resumed his work with the purpose of calmly showing, from the very circumstances of his personal history, that the gospel which the Galatians had received from him had solely a Divine origin. This view of the passage likewise favours the reading, "Now I make known to you." For the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> has here that simply <span class="accented">metabatic</span> or transitionary sense which it  often bears when the writer is passing on to a fresh section of discourse. Thus, in par-titular, the conjunction is found with "I make known (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>)," in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-7.htm">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>; and with "I would not have you ignorant," in <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>. In fact, the direct purpose of the succeeding exposition would seem to be, not precisely so much to make good the particular point that the gospel which the apostle taught was sacred and inviolable, as to show that it was certainly true, and on that ground not to be departed from. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> cannot mean "draw attention to" or "<span class="accented">remind</span> you." Its only sense is "make known." Its employment here appears to indicate a feeling on the apostle's part that the point referred to had, perhaps, not as yet been made definitely clear to those, or at least to some of those, whom he was addressing. <span class="cmt_word">That the gospel which was preached of me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">touching the gospel which was preached by me</span>, <span class="accented">that it.</span> In the Greek, the noun "the gospel" is the accusative governed by "make known;" while in fact the <span class="accented">object</span> contemplated by the verb is, not the gospel itself in general, but certain circumstances relating to it expressed and implied in the following clause: "that it is not after man's fashion." This kind of construction is of frequent occurrence in Greek authors. Analogous examples are found in ver. 13 of this chapter, and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-15.htm">1 Corinthians 15:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>. The aorist tense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> points to the same time as was referred to in "called you" (ver. 6) and "we preached" (ver. 8), which are both in the same tense. <span class="cmt_word">Is</span> <span class="cmt_word">not after man</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">is not after the fashion of man</span>; that is, "is not to be estimated as a merely human thing." The clause does not immediately describe the origin of the gospel, which point is distinctly brought out in the next sentence; but rather the character which attaches to it <span class="accented">in consequence</span> of its origin. The sense of the phrase, "according to man," is illustrated by its use in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8</a>," Do I speak these things after the manner of men (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)?" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "accord-lug to merely human principles of action." <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>, "Walk after the manner of men." On the other band, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>, "godly sorrow," literally, "the grief which is according to God," is a grief such as God inspires and approves; and in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>, "The new man, which after God [literally, 'according to God'] hath been created," is "created in conformity with God's model or approval" The present tense "is" marks the permanent character attaching to Paul's gospel; it was "the faith once for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span>) delivered to the saints" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>).

The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> ("I <span class="accented">myself"</span>)<span class="accented">is</span> inserted in the Greek, as contrasting the preacher with those to whom the gospel had been preached (ver. 11), in the same way as it is inserted in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23</a>, "I <span class="accented">myself</span> received (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you." Some expositors (as Meyer, Alford) connect the "for neither" with the pronoun "I <span class="accented">myself"</span> only; as if the meaning were, "For neither did I, any more than Cephas or James, receive the gospel from men." This restriction of the "neither" to the noun or pronoun only which follows, is grammatically, of course, not inadmissible (comp. <a href="../../par/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). But there is nothing in the immediate context to suggest the idea that the writer is just now thinking of the other apostles, and the sentence is perfectly clear without our introducing it. It is quite clear that the apostle means in the words <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> to affirm that man did not <span class="accented">teach</span> him the gospel any more than <span class="accented">deliver</span> it to him. But the verb "was taught," taken by itself, does not convey the idea of merely human instruction, being used continually in the Gospels of our Lord's teaching, and <a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a> of the "teaching" of the Holy Spirit. We must, therefore, conclude that the passive verb "I was taught it" is, in the writer's intention, conjoined with the active verb "I received it," as both alike depending upon the first words in the sentence," at the hand of man." If so, we have here another instance of the use of the figure zeugma (see above on ver. 10); for while the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> is used in its proper sense, when, as here, it is connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it is only in a strained, <span class="accented">improper</span> sense that it could be employed, like <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;</span>, with a passive verb, to simply denote the agent. Some difficulty is felt in determining in what way the writer regards the notion of "receiving the gospel" as distinguishable from that of "being taught it." It is possible that the latter is added merely, as Bishop Lightfoot supposes, to explain and enforce the former. But another view is descrying of consideration. We may suppose "the gospel" to be  regarded, in the one case, as a kind of objective creed or form of doctrine,"received" by a man on its being put before him, in consideration of the authority with which it comes invested, as a whole and so to speak <span class="accented">en bloc</span>, before ever its details have been definitely grasped by him. But in addition to this, and subsequently to this, this same gospel rosy be regarded as brought within the range of the recipient's distinguishing consciousness, by means of a "teacher" from without, whether Divine or human, instilling into his mind successively the various several truths which compose it. Now, it was <span class="accented">conceivable</span> that the apostle may, in the sense above supposed, have "received" the gospel direct from God or from Christ, while, however, man may to a large extent have been the "teaching" instrument, through which its truths were brought home to his understanding. But in the present passage St. Paul affirms that in actual fact man had no more to do with his reception of the gospel in the latter sense than in the former. And this affirmation tallies closely with what we read in the sixteenth verse of this chapter, and again with the sixth verse of the next chapter, both of which passages were written, no doubt, with an eye to the very notion respecting the source of his knowledge of the gospel which he is here concerned to negative. Textual critics differ among themselves whether <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("nor") or <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> ("nor yet") should be read before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. The only difference is that "nor yet" would of the two the more clearly mark a distinction subsisting between the notions expressed by the two preceding verbs. If we acquiesce in the reading of the received text, which is "nor," then, since the negative has been already expressed, the idiom of our language would here suppress the negative in "nor," and substitute the simple "or." <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>); <span class="accented">but only.</span> The strongly adversative sense which marks this form of "but" requires that in thought we supply after it the words, "I received it and was taught it;" for which, in translating, we may put, as an adequate substitute, the word "only." Bishop Wordsworth translates this <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> "except," citing in justification <a href="../../par/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23</a>. But the grammatical construction of that passage is not sufficiently clear to justify us in giving to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> a sense which does not appear conformable with its ordinary usage. The apostle, then, affirms that it was not from or by <span class="accented">man</span> that he had received the gospel or been taught it. From <span class="accented">whom</span>, then, does he mean that he had received and <span class="accented">by whom</span> been taught it? Are we to say, God the Father? or, Jesus Christ? Just at present, it should seem, the apostle is not concerned definitely or contradistinctively to present to view either one of these Divine personalities. As has been re, marked above with reference to the words in ver. 3, "from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ," the two conceptions appear blended together to the apostle's view, when he thinks of the Source flora which spiritual gifts accrue to us. His immediate purpose is to assert that his gospel was in its origin Divine, and not human. For this it is enough to say that it came to him "through the revelation of Jesus Christ." But in preparation for the discussion of these words, it may be here remarked that the supreme agency of God the Father, as in all else, so also in particular in the communication to the world of the gospel, is an idea very distinctly put forth in a great many passages of the New Testament, and is in fact the dominant representation. As examples of this, we may refer to <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>. "The words" which "the Son spake" were those which "he had heard of the Father," as were also those which the promised Paraclete was to "speak." The first verse of the Book of the Revelation furnishes a striking illustration of this truth. It runs thus: "The revelation of Jesus Christ, <span class="accented">which God gave him to show unto his servants</span>, even the things which must shortly come to pass: and he [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jesus Christ] sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John." Of course, the verse refers to that disclosure of future events which forms the subject-matter of the particular book which it prefaces. Nevertheless, what is written here is no exceptional statement, but one . simply exemplary; it is true in this particular reference, just because it is true also with reference to the whole of that disclosure of spiritual facts which through the gospel is made known to the Church. <span class="cmt_word">By the revelation of Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> This genitive clause, "of Jesus Christ," has by most interpreters been understood <span class="accented">subjectively</span>; that is, as denoting the subject or agent implied in the verbal noun "revelation;" in other words, they suppose St. Paul herein presents Jesus Christ as having revealed to him the gospel This does indeed appear to be the meaning of the phrase, "the revelation of Jesus Christ" in <a href="../../par/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>, just now referred to. Taken thus, the words put before us explicitly the agency of only Christ in the revelation spoken of, leaving the agency of God without specific reference. None the less, however, does even in this case the thought of God's agency naturally recur to our minds as implied in connection with the mention of Jesus Christ, even as in the first verse of the chapter where it is explicitly  named therewith. But we have to observe that in every other passage in which the Apostle Paul uses a genitive with the noun "revelation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), the genitive denotes the object which is revealed. These are <a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>," Revelation of the righteous judgment of God;" 8:19, "Revelation of the seas of God;" 16:25, "Revelation of the mystery;" and the passages in which he designates our Lord's second coming as "his revelation;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>; with which comp. <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>. That in these five last passages the genitive is objective and not subjective, if it could otherwise be called in question, is indicated by the circumstance that in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14, 15</a>; where the apostle uses the word "appearing"(<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) instead of "revelation," he adds, "which in its own times he shall show who is the blessed and only Potentate," etc., manifestly meaning the Father. One other passage remains to be mentioned, namely, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>, "visions and revelations of the Lord," which many critics take as meaning "vouchsafed by the Lord," and which in consequence is commonly referred to in support of a similar interpretation of the passage now before us. But it may be questioned whether the apostle does not there denote by "visions" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) a somewhat different class of spiritual phenomena from those denoted by "revelations of the Lord;" by the former intending such visions as those, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in which he seemed to himself to be transported into Paradise, or into the third heaven; and by the latter, appearances vouchsafed to him of the Lord Jesus in personal presence. These latter, it is true, might be also fitly styled" visions" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as, in fact, the most important of them all is styled in the speech before Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a>); whilst on the other hand, the former may be justly supposed to be included under the term "revelations," as employed presently after in ver. 7. But the addition, "of the Lord," has at least much more point, if we assume the above-stated discrimination to have been intended between the two classes of phenomena; if, indeed, it is not a quite superfluous adjunct on the other view; tot the "visions and revelations" referred to would be, of course, conceived of as coming from "the Lord," without the apostle's saying so. Instead of being available in support of the subjective view of the genitive before us, the passage <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a> rather favours the other interpretation. And this interpretation of the words, "of Jesus Christ," as objective is favoured by the subsequent context. For comparing this twelfth verse with the five verses which follow, we observe that in this verse the apostle affirms that his gospel was not human in its character, because that he had not received it from man nor been taught it by man, but only "through <span class="accented">the revelation of Jesus Christ."</span> Then in the five verses which follow, to make this affirmation good, he states that up to the time of his conversion he had been wholly averse to the Christian doctrine and intensely devoted to Pharisean Judaism, and that when God, calling him by his grace, "revealed <span class="accented">his Son in him that he might preach him among the Gentiles</span>," he applied to no human being for mental direction, but kept himself aloof from even those who were apostles before him. Now, in setting the statement of ver. 12 over against the professedly illustrative statement which follows, we observe that "the revelation of Jesus Christ" in the former occupies precisely the same position in the line of thought which in the latter is held by "God's revealing his Son in him;" for the apostle attributes his possession of the truth of the gospel in the one to "the revelation of Jesus Christ," and in the other to God's revealing his Son in him, and in each case to nothing else. Surely it follows "that the revelation of Jesus Christ" which gives him the gospel in the one ease, is identical with "God's revealing his Son in him' which gives him the gospel in the other. Thus both the sense in which the genitive is ordinarily found when joined with the word "revelation," and the guidance of the context, concur in determining for the genitive in the present case the objective sense. This interpretation seems at first sight to labour under the inconvenience that, so construed, the sentence lacks the clearly expressed antithethon to the foregoing noun "man," which we might naturally expect to find. But in reality the required antithesis is quite distinctly though implicitly indicated in the very term "revelation; "for this essentially carries with it the notion of an agency not merely superhuman, but Divine. It would be an altogether contracted and indeed erroneous view of this "revelation" to suppose that it means no more than the manifestation to Saul's bodily senses of the personal presence and glory of Christ. Beyond question this was of itself sufficient to convince Saul of the truth that Jesus, though once crucified, was now both living and highly exalted in the supersensuous world, and by consequence to furnish the necessary basis for further discoveries of truth. But more was required than the mere bodily sight of the glorified Jesus. This might confound and crush down his antagonism, but would not of itself' impart converting and healing faith. Men might "<span class="accented">see"</span> and yet "not believe" (<a href="../../par/john/6-36.htm">John 6:36</a>). There was required also the true and just perception of the relation which  this exalted Jesus bore to individual human souls, in particular to Saul's own soul; and further, of the relation which he bore to the dispensations of God as dealing with his people, and as dealing with mankind at large; - a perception of these things which would then only be true and just when accompanied with a duly appreciative, satisfying, adoring sense of the infinite excellency of what was thus disclosed to him, and of its perfect adaptation to the wants of man as sinful. In short, this "revelation" to Saul "of Jesus Christ" involved that spiritual transformation which, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>, the apostle describes in the following words: "It is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light [<span class="accented">or</span>, illumination] of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." For in that passage, though in the form in which he clothes his thought he speaks as if conjoining others with himself, it appears almost certain that he is describing there, as further on in vers. 7-12, his own personal experiences (see beginning of note on ver. 8). and also that he is describing that first introduction into his own understanding and heart of the truths of the gospel, which qualified him thenceforward to fulfil his mission to proclaim it. This appears confessedly to have been in a very marked degree a <span class="accented">miracle -</span> a moral and spiritual <span class="accented">miracle.</span> In truth, the new birth of a human s y accounted for by these or those conditions of his foregoing psychological history. These last may have prepared a favourable field of development; but he knew for a surety that the product itself was no natural offspring of any spontaneous operations of his own mind. The very phrase in the verse before us, "the <span class="accented">revelation</span> of Jesus Christ," as well as the comparison which in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> he draws between his spiritual transformation and the supernatural operation of the Almighty's fiat, "Let there be light," plainly shows that he would have refused to allow the cause discoverable anywhere else save in the unexplainable operations of sovereign, almighty grace. And in all prudence we should be content to be herein not wiser than he. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For ye have heard</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>). This "for" introduces the whole statement which follows down to the end of the chapter; for the entire section is written with the view of substantiating the assertion in ver. 12, that he had not received the gospel which he preached from man, but solely through illumination imparted immediately from heaven. "Ye have heard," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> have been told; as <a href="../../par/acts/11-1.htm">Acts 11:1</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1</a>, and often. "I am only stating what ye have already been apprised of, when I tell you of," etc. That the aorist tense of the Greek word does not limit the expression to any one communication, such <span class="accented">e.g. as</span> one made by the apostle himself, is shown by the use of this very aorist in blurt, 5:21, 33, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-2.htm">Ephesians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-21.htm">Ephesians 4:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>. The apostle appears to have been himself in the habit of frequently telling the wondrous story of what he once had been and of the change wrought upon him. We have instances of his doing this in fill detail in his speech from the stairs, and in his defence before Agrippa (<a href="../../par/acts/22-1.htm">Acts 22:1-16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26.htm">Acts 26</a>.), and with less fulness in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8, 9</a>. It is therefore quite supposable that he had himself said as much also in Galatia. We observe, however, that the apostle does not say, "heard from me," as he might have done if he had himself been their informant: and, further, that the effect of the words, "ye have heard," does not, in point of construction at least, of necessity extend beyond the fourteenth verse. We are therefore at liberty to surmise that what he here refers to as having been told them relates simply  to his life before his conversion; and that the accounts which they had received of it bad come through unfriendly informants. These may have been either unbelieving Jews or Judaizing Christians, who wished by these statements to disparage the apostle's character as one who, if he really was not dishonest, was at all events capable of passing from one extreme of sentiments to their direct opposite with the utmost suddenness and levity, and therefore was not a man entitled to be regarded with confidence. <span class="cmt_word">Of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">of my manner of life formerly in Judaism.</span> "The manner in which I once behaved myself as devoted to Judaism."

"Judaism" means "the religious life of a Jew," which distinctively was Mosaism. It occurs in 2 Macc. 2:21 2Macc. 14:38; 4 Macc. 4:16.

Saul was then "a young man" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>); and the reference which he here makes to "coevals" of his, as sharing in his Judaistic enthusiasm, but outstripped by him therein, seems to point to the rising up at that time of a party, "a young Jewry," as we might nowadays style it. especially espoused by the more youthful "Hebrews," which devoted itself to the revival and consolidation of Pharisean Judaism in its most advanced form. We may cone,lye of them as actuated by antagonism, alike to the <span class="accented">Gentilizing</span> spirit of the Herodians; to the rigid bare form of Mosaism cherished by the Sadducees which rejected that development of spiritual doctrine which for many generations had been going on in many pious and thoughtful minds; and finally, and perhaps most specially of all, to the new but rapidly spreading sect of the "Nazarenes." "In my nation." The apostle says "my," as  conscious of the presence of the Gentiles to whom he is writing. For the like reason uses the singular possessive pronoun, "my people (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) in his address to  Felix and in his defense before Agrippa, this king sitting only as an assesor by compliment at the side of the heathen governor. (<a href="../../par/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-4.htm">Acts 26:4</a>). Elsewhere also St. Paul uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> "nation" to denote the Jewish people, whence also he employs the phrase "my kinsmen" <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> when addressing Gentiles to denote a fellow-Jew in contrast to Gentiles (<a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3, 16</a>:7, 21).

It means, therefore, more excessively than they." The word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> rendered "zealous," followed by the genetive "of the traditions," has much the same meaning as in the phrases, "zealous of spirits [<span class="accented">or</span>, spiritual gifts];" "zealous of good works;" "zealous of the Law" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-12.htm">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>); in all which passages it is rendered in the Authorized Version as here. Its meaning is illustrated by use of the verb from which it is derived in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>, "Desire earnestly to prophesy;" denoting, as it should seem, "admire and long to possess" "aspire after" (see below, the notes on Galatians 4:17, 18). The clause may be paraphrased, "With more excessive fervency than they, affecting [<span class="accented">or</span>, being devoted to] the traditions of my fathers." The only remaining passage in the New Testament in which the Greek word occurs as an adjective in <a href="../../par/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), "zealous towards God" (Authorized Version), "zealous for God" (Revised Version); where the <span class="accented">sense is</span> probably still that of fervent devotion, but implying also a palliating reference to the intense zeal which the Jews were then showing in vindicating the honour of God against a supposed insult. "Zeal towards" an object implies also a "zeal for it;" in other words, fervent attachment and devotion has also an outward-looking aspect of resentment and resistance against any who are regarded as disposed to assail what we love. And this latter element of thought, the vindicatory, is frequently the more prominent of the two, in the use of the word "zeal" and its derivatives, in the Hellenistical Greek of both the LXX. and the New Testament; while in some cases it is not clear which for the moment is the most in the speaker's mind The latter, no doubt, forms the principal notion of the name "Zealot" as applied in the closing decades of the Jewish commonwealth to a fanatical party, who felt they had a special vocation to vindicate the honour of God and his service by deeds of rancourous violence; to which party probably at one time belonged the Simon who in <a href="../../par/luke/6-15.htm">Luke 6:15</a> is styled "Zelotes," a word no doubt, synonymous with the Chaldeian word "Cananaean" found in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>. In the phrase, "the traditions of my fathers," the apostle has been supposed by some critics to allude to the circumstance that he was "the son of a Pharisee:" thus making it equivalent to "the traditions of my family. But the context shows that he is thinking of traditions observed likewise by those "coevals" of his to whom he refers; the "fathers," therefore, are the forefathers of the nation, equivalent to the "<span class="accented">elders</span>," in the phrase current among the Jews, "the tradition of the elders" (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-2.htm">Matthew 15:2</a>)., Comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>, "Your vain manner of life <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> handed down from your fathers." In the possessive pronoun "my" the apostle still speaks of himself as a born Jew, in contradiction to Gentiles such as he was addressing. If he had been addressing Jews, he would probably have written "our," or omitted the pronoun altogether, as in <a href="../../par/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-17.htm">Acts 28:17</a>. There seems to be a tone of <span class="accented">mimesis</span> in the phrase: <span class="accented">q.d</span>. "The traditions which I proudly and fondly cherished as those of my fathers." The adjective rendered "of the fathers" marks them as those who had transmitted <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> those traditions <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, not merely those who had possessed them. It has been questioned whether this phrase "paternal traditions" <span class="accented">includes</span> those transmitted religious maxims and observances which the Mosaic Law itself prescribed. Probably it does. The "customs which [the Jews said] Moses delivered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> to us" (<a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). as they appertained to "the fathers." at the same time, the apostle would hardly  have written as he here has done, if he had had these alone in his view; he would rather have introduced the venerable name of "the Law." The expression appears chosen as comprehending, together with the prescriptions of the original Law, those  transmitted maxims and usages also which are described in the Gospels (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15.htm">Matthew 15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7.htm">Mark 7</a>.) as things said "by" or "to" them of old time, or as "the traditions of the elders;" the particular instances of such which are specified in the Gospels being only samples taken out of a a very large class (<a href="../../par/mark/7-4.htm">Mark 7:4</a>). Our Lord himself, it is true, made a distinction between these two classes of religions doctrines or observances, rebuking specifically many of the latter class, and discountenancing the whole class in general when enforced on men's consciences as a religious obligation; in contrast with "the Word of God," these, he insisted, were "commandments" or "traditions of men" (<a href="../../par/mark/7-7.htm">Mark 7:7-13</a>). But a Judaist would hardly have been disposed to make the same distinction, Rather, it would be the habit of his mind to blend and confound the two together as forming one entire system of formal religion; regarding those of the latter class simply as explanatory of the former, or as a fitting suppletion required to give to the former due coherency and entireness. He would be disposed to consider that portion of the whole tradition which in reality was of purely human device as invested with the like obligatoriness as that other portion which could truly plead the sanction of Divine authorization. It is plain that this was the case with those Judaists with whom, in the Gospels, our Lord is seen contending. And in all the references which St. Paul makes to Judaism, whether as part of his own former life, or as confronted by him in his apostolic agency, nowhere, either, is <span class="accented">he</span> found making any distinction between the two certainly distinguishable elements which composed it. There were, however, different schools of thought in Judaistic traditionalism, some stricter, some more lax. We must, therefore, further define our view of the particular branch of "paternal traditions" which the apostle here refers to by remembering that, as he said in his speech from the stairs (<a href="../../par/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>), he had been "instructed according to the <span class="accented">strict</span> manner of the Law of their fathers;" trained, that is, to construe the requirements of the Law as these were interpreted by the strictest of all the schools; as he said before Agrippa, "After the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee" (<a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>). Here the inquiry presents itself - In what way does the substance of these two verses (13, 14) help to bear out the apostle's statement in ver. 12, that the gospel which he preached was altogether derived from God's own immediate revelation to himself? The whole complexion of the passage shows that the point which the apostle is here concerned to indicate relates to the posture of his own spirit at the time of his first receiving the gospel. The Saul of those days, he says, was animated by the sentiment of bitter hostility to the faith; by a stern resolve - the dictate, as he thought, of conscience - if possible to extirpate the Church. Was it supposable that a mind possessed with such an abhorrence of the Nazarenes was nevertheless accessible to voices and teachings coming to him out of their society? Again, an earnestly religious man according to his lights, Saul's spirit was absorbed by devotion to Judaism - to the eager carrying out in practice, and to the vindication, of those modes of religious life which the revered and fondly cherished traditions of his people recommended to him. Was it credible that he could for a moment have given a favourable hearing to statements, whether of matters of fact or of religious belief, which proceeded from a sect of <span class="accented">latitudinarians</span> such as these, whose teacher had notoriously been foremost both in trampling down the fences of Pharisaism in his own practice and in loudly denouncing alike its principles and its representatives? Why, anything which those men could have said would to his view be at once self-condemned because simply of the quarter from which it issued. It may be objected that words which he had heard, we may confidently believe, from the martyr Stephen, who, in the controversy between Judaism and Christianity, may be regarded as <span class="accented">in a certain degree</span> Paul's own forerunner, and very supposably from many another confessor of the faith of less enlightenment than St. Stephen, though at the time repelled from his acceptance through his all-absorbing Pharisaism, may nevertheless have deposited in his mind pregnant seeds of thought and instruction afterwards to be fully developed. To this objection it appears a sufficient reply that the gospel <span class="accented">of the grace of God to all mankind</span>, untrammelled by any Judaical restriction whatever, which was the gospel entrusted to St. Paul, and which at this present hour of conflict in Galatia he was more specifically concerned to maintain, had at the time of his conversion been as yet most imperfectly disclosed even to the most advanced disciples of the faith. This more perfectly developed form of the gospel it was not possible that he should have heretofore heard from any Christian martyr or from any Christian teacher; for at float time it was still a <span class="accented">mystery</span>, not patent as yet to the eyes of even apostles themselves (see <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1-7</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called <i>me</i> by his grace,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when it pleased God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and when it was the good pleasure of God.</span> The Authorized Version and the Revised Version have "but when." To determine the exact force here  of the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, we must consider how the sentence it introduces stands related to what precedes. The main underlying thought of vers. 13, 14 was that the habit of the apostle's mind before his conversion was such as wholly to preclude the notion of his having known the gospel up to that hour. The main thought pervading vers. 15-17, and indeed pursued to the end of the chapter, is that, after he had received from God himself the knowledge of the gospel, he had had no occasion to have recourse to any mortal man, apostle or other, for the purpose of further instruction therein. It follows that the conjunction connecting the two sentences is not <span class="accented">adversative</span>, as it would, of course, be taken if God's dealings with him, described in vers. 15, 16, were the main point of this new paragraph, but is simply the sign of the writer's passing on to <span class="accented">another</span> thought - not one contrasted with the preceding, but merely additional. As examples of the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> as <span class="accented">continuative</span> and not <span class="accented">adversative</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/luke/12-11.htm">Luke 12:11, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-10.htm">Acts 12:10, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-15.htm">1 Corinthians 16:15, 17</a>. It may be represented in English by "and" or "and again." In the reading of the Greek text it is not certain whether we ought not to omit the word "God" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). If it is a gloss which has crept into the text, it is unquestionably a just gloss. Similar omissions of the Divine Name, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, are frequent in St. Paul (see ch. 1:6; 2:8; <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> properly exprcsses complacency; <span class="accented">as e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, "In whom I am well pleased;" and often. And this notion may be commonly traced in its use even when followed, as here, by an infinitive. Thus in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, "It would have been a pleasure to us to impart," etc.; in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>, "It was painful to us to be left alone, but under the circumstances we gladly chose to be so." When applied, as here, to God, the notion of the pleasure which he takes in acts of beneficence must not be lost sight of; "Was graciously pleased;" comp. <a href="../../par/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." In <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a> the noun "good pleasure" points to the act of "predestination" spoken of as (if we may venture so to speak of God) a volition of his heart and not of merely his regulative wisdom. The apostle seems led to use the word here by the complacency and joy which he himself felt in having been made the recipient of this "revelation;" those sentiments of his own bosom are, to his view, a reflection of the Divine complacency in imparting it. At the same time, the reader must be conscious of the deep sense, in fact the supremely prevailing sense, which the apostle has just here, that the imparting of the revelation spoken of was the fruit solely of a Divine volition triumphing over extreme wickedness and infatuation on his own part. Compare, in this respect also, the passage <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>, just cited. It is this feeling which prompts the introduction of the deeply emotional parenthesis consisting of the two next clauses of the verse. <span class="cmt_word">Who separated me from my mother's womb</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">who set me apart from my mother's womb.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, set apart, separate, which is found used in other relations in <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a> (LXX.); <a href="../../par/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>, is employed here with an implied reference to a specific office or work. Such a reference is explicitly added in <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>," Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them;" and in <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, "Separated unto the gospel of God." There is this distinction, however, between the "setting apart" of the present passage and that of <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, that, whereas in the latter it was one actually realized, here it is in the Divine predestination only, which last seems to be nearly the sense of the words, "whereunto I have called them," in the Acts. In <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a> the verb probably includes both senses. "From my mother's womb" means "from the time that I was as yet unborn;" not perhaps exactly "ever since my birth," as <a href="../../par/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/19-12.htm">Matthew 19:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-2.htm">Acts 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-8.htm">Acts 14:8</a>; comp. rather <a href="../../par/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>, as illustrated by ver. 41. The addition of these words is designed to mark the purely arbitrary character of this predestination. Comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-11.htm">Romans 9:11</a>, "The children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand." Viewed thus, the clause appears as an utterance of adoring humility on the part of the apostle, combined, however, with the strongest possible assertion of the Divine origin of his mission. A similar statement of God's arbitrary selection of a particular human being for a particular function is found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1</a>, "The Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name; "ibid., ver. 5, "That formed me from the womb to be his servant;" and again, with yet more striking resemblance, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>)." It is difficult not to believe that this conviction of the apostle concerning himself as an object of God's predestinating purpose, and perhaps even the form of its expression - for compare the words in the next verse, "That I might preach him among the Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>)" <span class="accented">- was</span> very mainly derived from the Lord's words to  Jeremiah, applied by the Spirit to his own particular case (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>). The apostle feels that all the while that he had been pursuing that career of persecuting impiety and passionate Pharisaism, the Almighty had kept his eye upon him as his predestined apostle, and been waiting for the fitting hour when to summon him forth to his work. <span class="cmt_word">And called me by his grace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). As the "setting apart" mentioned in the previous clause unquestionably was a "<span class="accented">setting</span> apart" for the apostolic office, it might seen convenient to understand the "calling" likewise as a calling to be an apostle. So most probably we are to take the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a> as meaning "called to be an apostle;" and in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a> the verb "<span class="accented">called"</span> is used of one called to be a priest. But the prevailing sense of "<span class="accented">being</span> called," in St. Paul's writings, refers to the bringing of the soul to Christ and into his kingdom; and in this definite reference the apostle uses the verb no less than twenty-four times, three of them in this Epistle (2 Corinthians 1:6; 5:8, 13). And this, the regular use of the term, is quite in place here. It was quite natural that the writer, after so vividly portraying his former life when unregenerate, should now distinctly advert to the moral transformation which by Divine grace he had been the subject cf. The word "grace" denotes God's freely expanding unmerited goodness, not as existing in himself, but as energizing upon men. This is made clear by the introduction of the preposition (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span>) "through" or "by." It is that "grace whose "reigning" power the apostle so exultingly extols in <a href="../../par/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15-21</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved"). The notion of mercy shown to the utterly undeserving is a prominent element of the word, connected as it is here with the description of the writer's former wickedness (comp. the use of the verb "obtained mercy (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)" in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13, 16</a>). This clause, together with the preceding one, is not to be taken as a part of the historical statement in conjunction with the next verse, as if tracing the successive steps of the transaction, but as a periphrastic designation of Almighty God adapted to the circumstances of the case. The one article prefixed in the Greek to the two combined clauses shows this. We need not, therefore, perplex ourselves to determine the relation in point of time which the Divine acts here indicated bear to that described in the verse which follows. The tone of the verse is in a measure apologetic, rebutting the prejudice which, we may be sure, did in the view of many accrue to the writer from what he once had been. Thus: "Nevertheless, God had all along, even kern the dawn of his being, set him apart to be his apostle; God, by a marvellous exercise of goodness, had called him forth out of that evil state to be his own: unworthy, no doubt, he had proved himself to be of such mercy; but what God's grace had made him, <span class="accented">that</span> he was; for who should dare to contravene <span class="accented">his</span> hand (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8-10</a>)?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To reveal his Son in me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). The rendering "<span class="accented">in me</span>," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "in my soul," or, in the idiom of the New Testament, "<span class="accented">in</span> my heart," is quite borne out by the use of the same preposition in numerous passages; e.q. <a href="../../par/john/2-25.htm">John 2:25</a>, "Knew what was in man;" <a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>," Shall become in him a well;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, "Christ in you the Hope of glory;" <a href="../../par/romans/7-17.htm">Romans 7:17, 20</a>, "Sin which dwelleth in me;" <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>," The Spirit of God dwelleth in you;" <a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "Christ in you;" <a href="../../par/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>, "God which worketh in you" (comp. also <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>). Chrysostom writes, "But why does he say, 'To reveal his Son in me,' and not 'to me'? It is to signify that he had not only been instructed in the faith by words, but that he was richly endowed with the Spirit; that the revelation had enlightened his whole soul, and that he had Christ speaking, within him" ('Comment in Galatians'). This exposition tallies remarkably with the description which the apostle in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a> gives of the process by which he had received the "treasure" of the gospel: "Seeing it is God, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light [<span class="accented">or</span>, illumination] of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." The "veil" which, while he was yet in Judaism, "had been upon his heart," was taken away; "with face unveiled" he was enabled to "behold, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-15.htm">2 Corinthians 3:15-18</a>). This account of his spiritual illumination, written near about the same time as the passage before <span class="accented">us</span>, shows the manner in which at that time the transaction presented itself to his mind. This revelation of God's Son to him involved, we may feel certain, the revelation of him in the relations which, as the once crucified and now exalted Christ, he bears to all mankind, Gentiles as well as Jews, and in the relations which he bears to his Church. "Christ Jesus" was then (to use the apostle's words in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>) "made unto him Wisdom from God, both Righteousness and Sanctification and Redemption;" and what Christ was then of God made to be to Paul himself, <span class="accented">that</span> also, as the joyful recipient of the revelation at the same time learnt, Christ was through the recipient's own preaching of the Word to be of God made to all who should receive his rues. sage. The view cf. the passage above given  is required by the tenor of the context. If it is not admitted, there is nothing in the whole passage to make good the apostle's affirmation, in ver. 12, that he had received the gospel, not from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. If after the analogy of such passages as <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a>, "That in me as chief might Jesus Christ show forth all his long-suffering;" <a href="../../par/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>, "That I might show in thee my power;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>, "That in us ye might learn;" - we were to take the present clause to mean "To reveal to men the wonderful grace of his Son by what he did <span class="accented">in my case</span>," the words would merely point to Christ's mercy shown to him as a sinner; they would supply no statement of the fact of the apostle's having been furnished with the knowledge necessary in order that he might show the glad tidings of him among the Gentiles. In other words, the clause would neither satisfy the requirement of ver. 12 nor that of the dependent clause which follows. If, again, after the analogy of the words, "Ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me," in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-3.htm">2 Corinthians 13:3</a>, taking this to mean "Christ that speaketh by me;" or if the words in <a href="../../par/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>, "he will judge the world in righteousness by [Greek, 'in'] the Man whom he hath ordained," we propose to understand the meaning to be "Reveal his Son by me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by my preaching, we are met by the objection that the clause would anticipate the thought expressed by the following words: "That I might show the glad tidings of him among the Gentiles," which, however, stand as expressing their dependent <span class="accented">consequence.</span> Here the important question arises how the reference which the apostle here makes to the revelation of Jesus Christ made "in him" stands related to the accounts repeatedly given in the Acts of the personal sight of the Lord Jesus accorded to him at his conversion - accounts which are confirmed in the Epistles by the apostle's own words in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>, "Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?" To harmonize the two, some have been led to do violence to the phrase, "reveal in me," so as to make it in some way or ether to mean "reveal to me," and thus render it possible to make the words refer to that personal manifestation made to Soul's bodily senses. Others have had recourse to the yet more violent and indeed utterly destructive expedient of inferring from this phrase that the revelation of Christ made to the apostle at his conversion was altogether and exclusively spiritual; and that the spiritual sight of our Lord had been so realizing and vivid as to have been even mistaken by the apostle himself for a manifestation actually made to his senses. We are relieved of the necessity of adopting either of these methods of criticism by the consideration that, in the course of the argument which the apostle is now pursuing, there is nothing to lead him to speak at all of the outward circumstances accompanying his conversion. All that he now has occasion to refer to is the fact that at that time God Almighty did himself give to his soul so clear a view of his Son as qualified him at once to preach the gospel to the Gentiles; so clear that, not needing further illumination, he had in fact sought none of any mortal man. This is all that the line of argument requires the apostle now to refer to. A reference to the actual personal sight which he then had of the Lord Jesus would in no way have served his purpose. Such reference would not have even involved by inference, much <span class="accented">less</span> have definitely slated, the point which he now is concerned to state. This point <span class="accented">is</span>, plainly, the communication to his soul of the full knowledge of the gospel, and nothing else; and accordingly it is this alone that he now makes mention cf. It has been questioned at what precise juncture in the narrative of the ninth chapter of the Acts the revelation here spoken of should be supposed to have taken place. Our Lord's personal manifestation of himself to Saul on his road to Damascus, involving as it did the complete instantaneous overthrow of all his previous views, relative alike to "Jesus of Nazareth" and to the idea of the expel, ted "Messiah," must have been an all-important preparation for that full disclosure of the truth to his soul which is here indicated; but there is no sufficient reason for identifying the one with the other. The history of the Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>) and the Epistles (l Corinthians 11:23; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1, 8</a>) make mention of several occasions on which our Lord appears to have shown himself to St. Paul and made important communications to him; and the incidental manner in which these have come to be mentioned suggests the belief that they may have been only a few out of many similar instances, others of which have lain unmentioned. There may very supposably have been such taking place (we will say) presently after Saul's baptism, and pointed forward to by our Lord in his words to Ananias," I will show him how many things he must suffer for my Name's sake" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>). It is very possible that we do not commonly bear enough in mind how little, in fact, it is that the record tells us of this most interesting event; and, in particular, that we do not adequately realize the frequency and the intimate character of the communications to which this "choice instrument (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>)" of Divine teaching would seem to have been admitted by  his Master. And who (we may further ask) may venture to determine what part the Lord Jesus took personally, that is, by personal intercourse, in the process of illumination of which the apostle here declares himself to have been the subject, or how much of it was effected by the agency of the Third Person of the holy Trinity, cooperating with the intense action of Saul's own earnest, questioning, light-imploring mind, especially during those three days spokes of in <a href="../../par/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>? "For, behold, he prayeth!" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11, 12</a>). It seems only reasonable to believe that the revelation of his Son which (the apostle says) God vouchsafed to him, <span class="accented">preceded</span> his very first public appearance in the synagogues of Damascus as an evangelist, and that this revelation was not deferred, as some imagine it was, until after his withdrawal into Arabia. Indeed, that it did precede it appears to be conclusively established by the statement of the verse now before us and the next following; for the course of action described by the writer, both negatively and affirmatively, in the words beginning with, "I consulted not," is represented as ensuing "immediately" upon the "revelation in him of God's son." That the locality where this revelation was made was Damascus or its vicinity is indicated by the words, "I <span class="accented">returned</span> to Damascus," in ver. 17. This circumstance betokens the consciousness in the writer's mind that the story of his conversion was not unknown to his readers. <span class="cmt_word">That I might preach him among the heathen</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">that I might show the glad tidings of him among the Gentiles.</span> In this instance, as well as perhaps in some others, the Authorized Version falls somewhat short of representing the exact force of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> by rendering it "preach," which more nearly answers to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. In <a href="../../par/luke/8-1.htm">Luke 8:1</a>, where in the Greek we have the two verbs together (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), our translators were compelled to use another term; and accordingly they render <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "showing [Revised Version, 'bringing'] the glad tidings of [the kingdom of God];" which shade of thought was what the evangelist intended to suggest. The verb surely always retains <span class="accented">some</span> tinge of its original element of "<span class="accented">glad</span> tidings," though this may often have been more or less attenuated, as in the case of the word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, gospel, itself, by its becoming a set term. In the present instance, the apostle's posture of feeling at the time when the "joyful tidings" were first brought home to his own heart seems to suggest a return, at least here, to the original import of the word. The present tense of the Greek verb (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) points to the continuous character of the service; as if it were," That I should be a shower-forth of the glad tidings." The aorist would have recited the entire service as one whole. "Among the Gentiles." Dean Howson very justly observes, "We should mark how emphatic in all accounts of the conversion is the reference to his work among the Gentiles. Thus, 'The Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light,' are named by Christ himself in the first communication from heaven (<a href="../../par/acts/26-17.htm">Acts 26:17, 18</a>). To Ananias the direction is given, 'Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my Name before the Gentiles [and kings, and the children of Israel].'... To which we may properly add what was said to him at Jerusalem, when he first went thither from Damascus, 'Depart; for I will send thee far off to the Gentiles' (<a href="../../par/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>)  ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Immediately</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). The construction of the sentence imperatively requires us to connect this adverb with the two affirmative clauses which the writer adds to the two negative ones which he first interposes, and not with these two negative clauses alone, while, however, its import is felt to attach itself to these also. The turn of thought seems to be this: "I felt at once that I needed not to advise with any mortal man; no, not even with the older apostles; and accordingly I abstained from doing so; I immediately went away into Arabia, and then forthwith came back to Damascus." <span class="cmt_word">I conferred not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I consulted not.</span> The use of the Greek verb constructed with a dative as meaning "advise with," "seek counsel in personal intercourse with," is well illustrated by several passages cited by the critics: Diod. Sic., 17:116, "Consulting the soothsayers con-coming the sign;" Lucian, 'Jup. Trag.,' &sect; 1, "Consult with me; take me as your adviser in business;" Chrysippus (ap. in Suidas, <span class="accented">sub verb.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), "Consulting a dream-interpreter." Bengel takes the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the compound verb as meaning "further, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Divine revelation was enough for me." But the instances just cited of the use of the verb render this doubtful. On this point, see Ellicott's 'Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span> In <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a> the verb requires to be taken differently (see note). <span class="cmt_word">With flesh and blood</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). The phrase, "flesh and blood," occurs in four other places in the New Testament: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-50.htm">1 Corinthians 15:50</a> "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption;" <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-14.htm">Hebrews 2:14</a>, "Since the children are sharers in flesh and blood [the Revised Greek text reads 'blood and flesh '], he also himself in like manner  partook of the same;" <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against...  the spiritual <span class="accented">hosts</span> of wickedness in the heavenly <span class="accented">places</span>;" <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>, "Flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven." In the first two of these passages the phrase denotes the bodily nature of men viewed as subject to mortality; which is the turn of thought also in Ecclus. 14:18, where the human race is styled a "generation of flesh and blood." In the other two it denotes human beings themselves, described by their material nature, but with reference to their comparative inefficiency as viewed alongside, in <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> with purely spiritual agents; in <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> with God. In precisely the same way as in the last-cited passage, the apostle uses the phrase here. Knowing that God had himself revealed in him his Son, in order that he should proclaim him among the Gentiles, he at that crisis of action felt any reference for teaching or practical direction to mere men to be in his case altogether unnecessary. As the next clause specifies the older apostles, who are mentioned as being at that time at Jerusalem, it may be that the phrase, "flesh and blood," in its most immediate scope, contemplates believers or elders (for probably there already were Christian elders there) of Damascus. Ananias is the only Damascene believer <span class="accented">named</span> in the history, though it speaks of others (<a href="../../par/acts/9-19.htm">Acts 9:19</a>); he was a man of remarkably high estimation even amongst the unbelieving Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/22-12.htm">Acts 22:12</a>), and he had been honoured by Christ with a special vision, and sent by Christ on a special mission to Saul. If Saul had felt it to be incumbent upon him to advise with any servant of Christ, whether as to what he should believe or as to what he should do, surely to Ananias he would naturally have looked. But not even to an Ananias would Saul refer for guidance at this juncture. The sense which has frequently been given, to the phrase," flesh and blood," as meaning "the dictates of one's own fleshly nature," is neither favoured by its use in any other passage (although "the flesh," standing alone, might have admitted of such an interpretation), nor is it in any way suggested by the tenor of the context. The apostle is here dealing solely with his relations to other men. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a></div><div class="verse">Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither went I up to Jerusalem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="accented">neither went I up</span> (<span class="accented">or</span>, <span class="accented">away</span>).

Every reader must feel the consciousness of official parity with the twelve which transpires in this expression of St. Paul's. The like consciousness is apparent in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-11</a>, strongly as the writer there expresses his sense of comparative personal unworthiness. Why, it may be asked, does the apostle thus particularly refer to the "apostles before him"? The probable answer seems to be, for the purpose of more forcibly illustrating the assured conviction, which from the very first he entertained, of the sufficiency and Divine authority of the gospel which he had already received. <span class="cmt_word">But I went into Arabia</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but I went away into Arabia.</span> It is impossible to determine what was the precise locality to which St. Paul then went. "Arabia" was in those days a geographical term of very wide significance. Damascus itself appertained to Arabia; so Justin Martyr writes ('Dial. c. Tryph.,' 305, A) "that Damascus was of the Arabian country (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>-<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>), and is, even though now [probably, Bishop Lightfoot suggests, by Hadrian's arrangement of those provinces] it has been assigned to what is called the Syrophoenician country, none even of you are able to deny." So Tertullian, 'Adv. Mare,' 3:13; 'Adv. Judaeos,' 9. At the time of St. Paul's abode at Damascus the city was subject to an "ethnarch of Aretas" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>); and "Aretas," the King of Petra, is in the case of several successive princes, styled "the King of the Arabians" (2 Macc. 5:8; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:01, 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:06, 2; 'Ant.,' 16:10, 8, 9). The apostle's words may, therefore, describe a withdrawal into some district, whether inhabited or uninhabited, not far distant from Damascus. On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-25.htm">Galatians 4:25</a>, the apostle refers to "Arabia" in connection with Mount Sinai; so that Arabia Petraea may possibly have been the country visited. And here the imagination is tempted by recollections of Moses and the giving of the Law, and of Elijah, to indulge in speculations with reference to the especial appropriateness of that vicinity for being Saul's place of sojourn at this crisis of spiritual illumination and call to apostleship. But all this is conjectural: there is no solid ground whatever for our believing that it was thither flint his steps were at this season directed, And we  cannot but recollect, with reference to the Lord Jesus, that when, after his baptism, "the Spirit drove him forth into the wilderness," with a view, as we may in all reverence believe, to his preparing himself for his high ministry as the Christ, no one imagines that it was into the wilderness of Sinai that he was led. And this suggests the remark that, at this particular juncture in especial, Saul's movements were directed by heavenly guidance. This we seem warranted to infer from our Lord's words to him, "Rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-6.htm">Acts 9:6</a>). At such a season, indeed, the unceasing cry of his whole soul - a cry at, rely not unresponded to - must have been, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" For further description of the geographical question,see Conybeare and Howson, ch. 3; 'Dictionary of the Bible' articles "Arabia" and "Aretus;" Lightfoot's 'Galatians: Excursus,' pp. 87-92, 6th edit. <span class="cmt_word">And returned again unto Damascus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>). That is, "without going elsewhere or to any place where I could meet with men who could be my instructors in the gospel." This must be supposed to be implied; otherwise the narrative would be illusive. As above stated, the "immediately" appears intended to qualify this clause as well as the preceding. The evidential value of this reference to Damascus, by implication indicated as the scene of his previously mentioned conversion, is strikingly illustrated by Paley in his 'Heros Paulinae (Galatians), cited by Dean Howson, <span class="accented">in loc.</span> "A casual expression at the end, and an expression brought in for a different purpose, alone fixes it to have been at Damascus. Nothing can be more like simplicity and undesignedness than this." At the risk of repeating some remarks already made, I venture to propose the following as a just paraphase of the whole passage, beginning with ver. 12. "My gospel which ye are swerving from I did not in any degree receive from men, but solely through the revelation of Jesus Christ which God himself made to me. It is evident that before I knew Christ, during the time that I was persecuting God's own Church with fanatical fury, my whole heart and soul devoted to the strictest Judaism of the Pharisees, I was removed poles asunder from all possible sympathetic contact with this doctrine. That God's love was ready to embrace every believer in Christ, whether obeying Moses' Law or not obeying it, - this was a truth that in those days could not possibly have gained access to my mind. And after this, when God graciously illuminated my soul with the sight of his Son, in order that I might become the joyful herald of his grace to the Gentiles, to no mortal man, whether at Damascus or elsewhere, did I apply for further light; neither did I even repair to Jerusalem to seek instruction from Christ's own former apostles: I at once departed in a direction which took me where I was still far away [or, perhaps, "which took me farther and farther away"] from Jerusalem, into Arabia: and who should teach me this doctrine in Arabia? And then, forthwith, I came hack straight to Damascus, Damascus being my first appointed sphere of labour." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then after three years</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). The apostle's object is to illustrate the independent source of his doctrine as not derived from men. This he does here by indicating how long an interval elapsed after he first was made acquainted with it before he ever got to even know Peter. By this he gives his readers to feel how strongly assured from the very first was his conviction of the sufficiency and certain truth of those views of the "gospel" which had been divinely communicated to him. The obvious inference from this view of the writer's present purpose is that, in his reckoning of time, the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> in this verse is the era of "God's revealing his Son in him," which in effect was that of his conversion. There are two modes of computing time employed in the New Testament - the inclusive and the non-inclusive. According to the former, just as "after three days" in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-63.htm">Matthew 27:63</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/8-31.htm">Mark 8:31</a>, means in fact "on the next day after but one;" so in the present instance, "after three years" may denote a not greater interval than "in the next year after but one." Compare the "by the space of three years" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="../../par/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, taken in conjunction with "for the space of two years' of <a href="../../par/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>. On the other hand, according to the non-inclusive way exemplified in the "after six days" of <a href="../../par/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2</a> (compared with the "about eight days" of <a href="../../par/luke/9-28.htm">Luke 9:28</a>), the interval denoted may have been no less than three whole years. Since it is to the interest of the apostle's argument to mark the interval at its greatest, the reader will probably be of opinion that, if St. Paul had had in his mind a space of time which was not in reality less than three years, he would have used a form of expression more clearly marking this, and not one which might be easily taken as meaning less; and therefore that the phrase, "after three years," means in reality no more than "in the year after the next, not before." <span class="cmt_word">I went up to Jerusalem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The apostle writes "went up" with a Jew's instinctive feeling of Jerusalem being the capital and centre of his nation and its  religion; a feeling which would be all the stronger through the consciousness that it was as yet the capital and centre also of Christendom itself. <span class="cmt_word">To see Peter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>D; <span class="accented">to acquaint myself with Cephas.</span> As the Greek verb here used - which is found nowhere else in the New Testament, and not found at all in the Septuagint - has been often misunderstood, it seems desirable to give a somewhat full account of the manner in which it is employed in other writers. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, derived, through <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, knowing, learned, from the conjectural root <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;</span>, in the older Greek most commonly means "inquire of some one about some person or thing," and is constructed like <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;</span> other verbs of questioning. Thus, Eurip., 'Phaen ,' 621, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;</span>; "Ask me this question;" Soph., 'OEd. Tyr.,' 1156, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "Whom this man is inquiring about." So in Herod., 2:19. But sometimes, still in the older Greek, it means simply "knowing" or" personally knowing," with no associated notion of asking questions; as <span class="accented">e.g. A</span>Esch., 'Pers.,' 454, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "Ill apprised of the future;" 'Eum.,' 455, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, "My father thou knowest well." In the later Greek it frequently denotes personally acquainting one's self with some object, whether a person or a thing. Here again, as in its use just exemplified from AEschylus, the notion of asking questions is altogether absent. Thus, Josephus, 'Boll. Jud.,' 6:1, 8, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "When I got personally to know;" ' Ant.,' 8:2, 5, <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "I have in person Seen Eleazar, releasing demoniacs," etc.; 'Ant.,' 1:11, 4, <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "I have myself been and seen it (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the pillar of salt);" Plutarch, 'Thes.,' 30, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "See, inspect the country;" 'Pomp.,' 40, <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "See, or inspect the city." The result of this evidence is that, in all probability, the apostle means that he went up to Jerusalem to <span class="accented">acquaint himself</span> with Cephas. That in the present instance the verb was not at all meant to suggest the notion of questioning, either directly or by implication, though no doubt in the older form of the language it often means questioning, appears from two considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The words, "I went to question Cephas," with no indication added, either specific or general, of the matters to be inquired about, would present a very bald and imperfect sentence; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it would seem strangely incongruous that the apostle, just when concerned to give point to his affirmation that he received not his gospel from men, but fully and completely from God, should tell his readers that two or three years after his conversion he went up to Jerusalem to make inquiries of Cephas. Neither would the general use of the verb warrant us in understanding St. Paul to say that his object in making this journey was to "see Cephas" in that sense in which we sometimes employ the English verb, to denote a friendly visit; nor again would it justify us in interpreting it to mean "to put myself on a footing of acquaintanceship and friendship with him." No instance has been adduced in which the word has either of these two turns of meaning. Its import in the present instance appears to be this: St. Paul was hearing continually in all quarters a variety of statements respecting Cephas, the leader of the apostles, Cephas's doctrine, Cephas's manner of conduct both personal and ministerial, - statements, we may be sure, not always agreeing together. He knew the great importance of Cephas's position in the Church, not only with reference to the Jewish section of it with which that apostle was the most immediately associated, but also with reference to Gentile believers, he having been first of all the apostles divinely commissioned to open the door to the Gentiles. For the prudent shaping, then, of his own course in the prosecution of his ministry as apostle, it was of deep moment for St. Paul that he should have a more exact understanding of Cephas's personality, and of Cephas's principles of conduct in dealing both with Jews and Gentiles, than he could possibly gain from mere hearsay. He therefore resolved, most assuredly under Divine guidance, himself to repair to Jerusalem, to apprise himself by personal observation and intercourse of the true character of this most highly gifted and most influential leader of Jewish Christendom. Thus much, and so far as I can perceive no more than this, does the usage of the verb in the Greek of the time warrant us in finding in St. Paul's use of it in the present passage. And this view of it is confirmed by its singular appropriateness, when thus understood, to the connection in which it stands. No term could have more significantly implied the feeling which the writer entertained of the independence of his own position as a messenger of Christ to the world. Cephas's own self, he intimates, was the object which he sought by that journey to get to know. That <span class="accented">is</span>, there is not the faintest suggestion in the phrase employed of his having felt his own knowledge of the gospel to he imperfect, and that he wished to confer with Peter for the purpose of integrating his views. While, however, with the apostle the ruling motive in taking that journey may be supposed to have been as now stated, we are still at liberty to surmise that there were other accessory inducements. If  St. Paul felt that it was urgently needful for <span class="accented">him</span>, in the prosecution of his great mission, to know Cephas well, he could not but have also felt that it was of importance for the success of the great cause that Cephas should by personal intercourse be enabled to appreciate more certainly and distinctly than was otherwise possible what manner of man Saul himself now was, and should begin to recognize the gifts and calling which their common Lord had conferred upon him. Further, it is impossible not to believe that Saul would welcome with joy the opportunity which this visit would afford him of obtaining, from the lips of one who was a very principal eye-witness and minister in the matter discoursed on, more precise and more reliable accounts than it is probable he had as yet received, of many particulars appertaining to Christ's sojourn upon earth. And what a story Cephas had to tell him! With what ravishment of listening attention would Saul drink in at his lips the marvels of that Divine life and death, which it had been his privilege so closely to observe! And, on the other side, what joy on earth had the elder apostle greater than that of pouring into a truly sympathetic bosom those precious treasures of reminiscence. His two Epistles, written long after, evince clearly the profound, sweet complacency with which his mind was wont to dwell upon them. If, in Plato's immortal 'Phaedo,' a disciple of the martyred Socrates, when invited by a fellow-disciple, who by accident had not been at Athens at the time, to tell him the particulars of his master's death, would comply with alacrity, "for that to him nothing ever was so sweet as to be remembering Socrates, whether telling of him himself or hearing another do it" (2. 3:5,' Bekk'), how much more might not Cephas feel thus in transmitting to his attentive auditor those leaves of the tree of life which are for the healing of the nations! Nor can we doubt that Cephas would rehearse to him the particulars of the Lord's dealings with his own individual spirit: his own first interview with its then mysterious word, "Thou shalt be called Cephas!" the summons, "Follow me;" the restoration to health of his fever-stricken wife's mother; the miraculous draught of fishes, with the outcry, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man 1" and the gracious response, "Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men;" the walking on the sea, with its "Lord, save me!" the confession of his faith, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God," with the presently ensuing shrinking from the predicted cross, and the merited rebuke, "Get thee behind me, Satan!" the beatifying sight of the Transfiguration; the confident "Though all should deny thee, yet will I never deny thee," so soon rebuked by the triple denial, and the Lord's glance of reproving love; the appearing of the risen Christ to him individually on Easter Day; the morning scene by the margin of the Sea of Tiberias, with its triple confession of love and its triple charge; the closing scene on Mount Olivet; his wondrously blessed discourse on the day of Pentecost; his great work again with Cornelius, so full of in-retest for the newly constituted apostle of the Gentiles now hearing it. The story, told, we may be sure, with quivering lips, with streaming eyes, with features kindling with a rapture of holy, heavenly joy, unfolded a marvellous record of the redeeming Master's love and wisdom and power in dealing with that human soul; a Saviour's work, such as might even in some respects match that which Saul had himself to record. And this no doubt mutual interchange of spiritual experience would reveal each to the other, so as they never could else have been revealed. Saul had come thither for the purpose of acquainting himself with Cephas's personality; he went away knowing something of the weaknesses of his temperament, as well as able to love and admire his loyalty of soul and straightforwardness in action, his zeal, the warmth, the impetuosity even, of his affections, his tender entire devotion to his Lord. It is interesting in this relation to remark that when, in writing to the Corinthians, St. Paul recites historical proofs of Christ's resurrection, the five appearances of the risen Christ specified by him which were antecedent to the one vouchsafed to himself, are those which he was likely to have been told of on the occasion of this visit, when, as he states, he saw, together with Cephas, also James the Lord's brother. Of those five appearances, that to "James" the Lord's brother in all probability is not mentioned in the Gospels at all; that to St. Peter only in the way of most cursory allusion by the Pauline evangelist St. Luke. It would seem as if thus early was stamped on St. Paul's mind a form of historical recital available for customary use ever after. The certain truth of <span class="accented">these</span> appearances he then got to be assured of through personal testimony borne to himself by Peter and by James. <span class="cmt_word">And abode with him fifteen days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">and I tarried with him fifteen days.</span> The use of the preposition here rendered "with" is illustrated by <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/13-56.htm">Matthew 13:56</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. Since in the midst of a populous city the propinquity and (probably) association expressed by the preposition is referred to the one individual Cephas, the phrase, "I  tarried with him," is with the greatest probability taken to indicate a sojourn at St. Peter's house. Else, why did not St. Paul write, "I tarried in Jerusalem"? And this circumstance the apostle, as it should seem, indicates, with a latent reference to its significance. The fact was significant in various ways. It testified most openly and emphatically to a wondrous transformation in the mutual sentiments with which the two men regarded one another. It was but a short while ago, only some two or three years more or less, that Saul was viewed by St. Peter with repugnance and dread, as the bitter and influential persecutor of that flock of Christ which the Lord had so pointedly committed especially to <span class="accented">his</span> affectionate tendence. Even personally on his own behalf Peter "must have feared him, perhaps even have hidden himself from him, when he forced his way into Christian homes" (Dr. Farrar, 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 231). Only quite lately had the scattered members of the Church ceased to fear fresh onslaughts of the persecution which Saul had so eagerly pressed forward, and begun once more to openly assemble at Jerusalem. Yet now there were here to be seen, on the one side Cephas, forgivingly, affectionately welcoming Saul to his house; and on the other, the late scornful and hostile Pharisee submitting to be beholden to Cephas for hospitality! to Cephas for public recognition as a brother in Christ! That it was with a lively recollection of that newborn mutual brotherliness that the apostle penned this brief record of his visit to Cephas, dry and colourless matter-of-fact as it at first seems, we cannot doubt when we look back upon the highly coloured picture of his previous animosity against the Church of God, and his intense Pharisaism, and also observe that immediately after he brings directly into view the sentiments of wonder and adoring gratitude to God with which the Churches of Judaea beheld the change which had taken place in him. His mind is too intent upon the pressing business of the hour to allow itself in melting mood to loiter upon mere reminiscences of the past; it takes in, nevertheless, with however rapid a glance, the remembrance of those days; how strange, and withal how affecting, his position bad then been felt to be! We are not, however, to suppose that St. Paul devoted this most noteworthy fortnight altogether, or perhaps even principally, to fraternal intercourse with Cephas and James and the other newly found brethren in Christ residing in the capital. We learn from the history of the Acts that, after the misgiving, which not unnaturally bad been at first felt by even the leaders of the Christian community, as to the reality of his conversion to the faith, had been overcome through the interposition of the generous-hearted Barnabas, his ardent zeal thrust him forth without delay upon giving public proof of his consecration to the cause of Christ. He owed it to that cause that, in the place where he had so grievously and publicly sinned against it, he should try what he could to undo, if only he might, the mischief which when last at Jerusalem he had but too well succeeded in effecting. For this end he addressed himself to that very portion of the population amongst whom in those days of sin his hostility had been so conspicuously shown. He sought out the Hellenist Jews, whom he had then been so active in hounding on to their assault upon the holy Stephen, eagerly striving now by exhortation and argument to win them to believe. The endeavour was, however, fruitless. The evil which he had wrought in the past it was not given him in this field to repair. Christ himself, appearing in vision, warned him to desist. Earnestly he entreated to be permitted thus to plead for him; but his Master peremptorily commanded him to leave the city. "Depart quickly: they will not receive of thee testimony concerning me" (<a href="../../par/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>). The wish was natural, and to his honour; but it was not for this that his steps had been directed to Jerusalem. He should work for Christ extensively elsewhere, and not ineffectually; but here he was forbidden to stay. The eager, and for himself fearless, champion obeys, curbing his resolute spirit to compliance with the arrangements which the brethren at Jerusalem made for his safe transmission to Caesarea, from whence he sailed for Tarsus (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>.).

The reason of this will appear if we consider that "James the Lord's brother" was not really one of the apostles; but nevertheless, through the position which he held in the Church of Jerusalem, and through various circumstances attaching to him, stood in general estimation so near to the revered twelve, that St. Paul felt he was required, in connection with his present statement, to make this reference to him, when affirming so solemnly that Cephas was the only apostle that he then saw. For a fuller discussion of the personality of "James the Lord's brother," the reader is referred  to the additional note at the end of this chapter. How it came about that St. Peter was the only one of the twelve that St. Paul then saw, there are no certain grounds for determining. The intimation in <a href="../../par/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a> that, in the persecution which ensued upon the martyrdom of Stephen, the apostles still remained at Jerusalem when they of the Church there were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, relates to a period two or three years previous. The state of things was no doubt now quite different; the Church had come together again; but the apostles may for the most part have been absent in the country, engaged in their apostolic labours, as St. Peter himself is soon after described as being (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31, 32</a>). The surmise that this was the cause appears more probable than the view which supposes them to have continued distrustful, now that the two great leaders, Cephas and James, had been won over to frankly and publicly recognize the new convert. A difficulty has been thought to result from a comparison of these words of St. Paul with St. Luke's statement in <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15, 16</a>, that Barnabas took and brought him to "the apostles," and that he "was with them" going in and out at Jerusalem. That he was not with them for long was a fact not unknown to St. Luke, as we may, gather from what we read in <a href="../../par/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>. There is, therefore, no discrepancy in that respect between the two representations. But is there no discrepancy between St. Luke's mention of "the apostles" as then admitting Paul into partnership with them in public work, and St. Paul's so emphatically affirming that it was Cephas alone of the apostles that he saw? We must acknowledge that there is - the same kind and the same amount of discrepancy as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> obtains between St. Matthew saying that those who were crucified with Jesus reviled him, and St. Luke specifying that one did so, but that the other rebuked him. In all such cases, the more vague and general statement must in all fairness be accepted, but with the modification supplied by the one which is the more particular and definite. It seems to the present writer that there is a way of quite naturally accounting for the form in which St. Luke states the circumstances. It is as fellows. St. Paul had been two years in imprisonment at Rome when St. Luke compiled the Acts; that is, St. Luke wrote the book about A.D.  or 64, twenty-two or twenty-three years after St. Paul made this first visit of his to Jerusalem. Barnabas appears in the story as a disciple (<a href="../../par/acts/4.htm">Acts 4</a>, <span class="accented">fin.</span>) some years apparently before even the conversion of Saul. Considering, therefore, the lapse of time, it would seem a not at all improbable supposition that, when the Acts was written, he was no longer alive. And the tone in which he is spoken of in the book, whose author, as we know, was in close association with St. Paul, and no doubt both drew from the apostle's inspiration many of the particulars he relates and reflected his feelings, is generally so kindly and respectful as to accord well with the supposition of Barnabas's decease, and even of his then recent decease. The pensive, touching reference to his character in Acts 11:24, introduced in the narrative in so unwonted a manner as it is, betokens this. Carefully does the historian indicate that Barnabas was the new convert's sponsor with the at first distrustful brethren at Jerusalem; also that it was he that went and fetched Saul from his distant retirement at Tarsus to co-operate with him at Antioch; also that he linked him to himself in the eleemosynary journey to Jerusalem, and again under Divine direction in their great evangelistic tour in Asia Minor, - in both of which expeditions Barnabas at the first appears as the leading figure of the two; after which comes the mournful disruption recorded at the close of the fifteenth chapter, the last reference to Barnabas in the Acts. That, however, this interruption of their brotherly attachment did not last long is shown by the respectful and sympathetic manner in which St. Paul, in writing to the Corinthians (9.), six or seven years after, speaks of the oneness in sentiment subsisting between Barnabas and himself in labouring for the gospel at their own charges. Since the time that St. Paul sent that letter to the Corinthians as well as this to the Galatians, some five years had elapsed when St. Luke wrote the Book of the Acts. All these considerations taken together agree perfectly well with the conception that Luke had heard his master, perhaps repeatedly, make pensive reference to his old relations with Barnabas now gone to his rest. "When the apostles at Jerusalem," he might say, "looked upon me coldly and distrustingly, he it was that took me by the hand [the reader will note the pathos in the expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>] and led me into their presence,  and told them what the Lord had done with me!" What more natural than that Luke had heard Paul speaking thus, Barnabas's dear venerated form looming in the far past before the apostle's view as the principal object just then of reminiscence, the surrounding figures in the scene more indefinitely realized! But when, years before this, the apostle, Barnabas being still alive, had been writing to the Galatians, and with solemn carefulness as speaking in the sight of God, had set himself agonistically to state the facts in their very exactness, of course there would result a precision which in those tender reminiscences uttered to his bosom associate was not to be looked for.

So in St. Paul's inexact citation in <a href="../../par/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>. On this use of the Hebrew conjunction, see Gesenius, 'Thes.,' p. 678, B, 1, n, who observes that in such cases there is an evident ellipsis of some such verb as "I protest," "I swear." The apostle was frequently led by the gainsaying of adversaries vitally affecting his official or personal character, to have recourse to forms of the most solemn asseveration. In addition to the passages cited above, see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-23.htm">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-31.htm">2 Corinthians 11:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-8.htm">Philippians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>. If, as Alford in effect observes, a report had been spread among the Galatians that, after his conversion, he had spent years at Jerusalem, receiving instruction in the faith at the hands of the apostles, the facts which he has now stated would have seemed to his readers so astoundingly in contradiction to the impression which they had received, as to require a strong confirmatory asseveration." In the present case," as Professor Jowett remarks, "it is a matter of life and death to the apostle to prove his independence of the twelve." And his independence of them is strongly evinced by the fact that, for several years of his Christian life, during all which he was preaching the same gospel as he now preached, he had not even seen any of them except Peter and James the Lord's brother (if James could be reckoned as an apostle), and these only during a short visit of a fortnight at Jerusalem some three years after his conversion.

The verb "brought down" of itself indicates that the Caesarea here mentioned was Caesarea Stratonis, the seaport of Jerusalem, and not Caesarea Philippi towards Damascus (see Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>). When, later, Barnabas required Saul's help at Antioch, it was to Tarsus that he went to seek him. It is, therefore, probable that, in mentioning "Syria" with "Cilicia" as containing "regions" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/15-23.htm">Romans 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-10.htm">2 Corinthians 11:10</a>) in which, after this departure from Jerusalem, he was actively engaged in ministerial work, he is thinking of the northern part of Syria, as in "Cilicia" he is thinking of the eastern portion of Cilicia about Tarsus; northern Syria and eastern Cilicia having a great geographical affinity (see Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1. pp. 26, 130). It thus appears that the Epistle is in perfect harmony with the Acts. To the apostle's labours during this period that he was making Tarsus his head-quarters, was most probably due in no small measure the founding of the Churches in Syria, and especially in Cilicia, which are referred to in <a href="../../par/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23, 41</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/1-22.htm">Galatians 1:22</a></div><div class="verse">And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22-24.</span> - It is somewhat difficult to determine, and when determined to make evident in translation, the precise flexure in the intonation (so to speak) of these verses. So far as the present writer can see, it is this: the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 22 is slightly adversative to the foregoing sentence; as if it were, "During that time the people of Syria and Cilicia saw a great deal of me, but the Churches of Judaea did not see me at all." The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> in ver. 23 introduces a contrast to the foregoing "unknown by face;" as if it were, "They knew me not by face, but only by report." The rendering to be now given will endeavour to represent this view of the whole passage. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And was unknown by face</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="accented">but I was all the while unknown by face.</span> The dative  <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>, "by face," or "in person," marks (see Winer,' Gram.

Its addition prepares the reader for the subsequent intimation that, though unknown by personal presentment, he was not unknown by repute (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1fb3;</span>). The widened form of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, intimates the long-continued period, represented by the words "all the while" in our rendering, for which the statement held good; which observation applies also to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 23. The word "still," introduced in the Revised Version, imports, as I humbly venture to think, on idea not actually expressed in the Greek. The apostle states no more than that the Churches of Judaea had at that time no opportunity of coming to know him personally. There is no <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, They had, that is (for this is what seems intended), no opportunity of knowing him in his new character as a disciple of Christ. Whether or not they had known him in the terrible aspect of an unrelenting persecutor, is a matter which for the present lies out of the field of view. The period to which the apostle means this remark of his to apply may be assumed to be the whole time between his conversion and the close of this stay of his in "<span class="accented">Syria</span> and Cilicia." This, as we learn from the Acts, terminated with Barnabas's fetching him to join him in his work at Antioch. After this he did become known to the disciples of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Churches of Judaea which were in Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). This honorific form of designation, "which were in Christ," breathes a feeling on the part of the apostle of reverential respect for those Churches, as already organized communities vitally united to Christ, while he was as yet only beginning his Christian life (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>, "Who were also in Christ before me"). This ceremonious respectfulness is the more in place, inasmuch as the apostle had reason to know that the doctrinal position which he fell himself set to defend, in reference to obedience to the Mosaic Law, was generally distasteful to Jewish believers. Grateful is it, however, to his own feelings to recollect, and now thus publicly to recognize, the kindness and devout thankfulness which in those early days of his Christian career they had evinced with reference to him (see note on ver. 24). At the same time, his entire independence of the whole Jewish community when first beginning to preach is plainly indicated. It was from no Judaean Church any more than from Jerusalem and its apostles and elders that he derived the gospel which he had then and ever since been proclaiming. If we take the bearing of the clause, "which were in Christ," as above proposed, we have no need of (Ecumenius's remark, endorsed by various critics, including Alford and even Bishop Lightfoot, that it was added to distinguish the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of Christians from synagogues of non-Christian Jews. Indeed, the remark is itself open to grave exception. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in the singular number is used of the whole Israelite community antecedently to the Christian dispensation; but it is never found either in the New Testament or in the Septuagint to denote, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> does, an organized collection of Israelites as such, dwelling in a particular neighbourhood, in the way that it is applied to an organized collection of Christians in a neighbourhood; neither is the noun ever applied to Israelites as such in the plural number. The term <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would, of course, be taken to mean Christian Churches and no other.

We have here the early beginnings of that objective sense in which afterwards the word got to be so commonly used in the Church to denote the Christian doctrine (see Bishop Lightfoot's essay 'Galatians,' pp. 154-158). In the second clause, "which he was sometime  making havoc of," the "faith" is identified with the Church which held it (comp. ver. 13). We may heartily accept Estius's comment, cited by Meyer, "Quia Christi fidelibus fidem extorquere nitebatur," while we still think it intolerably harsh to understand "faith," as Meyer does, in a subjective sense.

The sentence is not essential to the line of thought in vers. 21-23. The apostle was probably prompted to add it by the complacency which he felt in the interest and sympathy which in those days the Jewish Churches showed towards him - sentiments which afterwards faded too much away into those of suspicion and alienation (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>). He rejoices to remember, and he will have the Galatian Churchmen know, that once the believers of the circumcision were proud of him, and were satisfied that he was preaching the true gospel of Christ.

Revelations were frequently made to the apostle, both to communicate important truths (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>) and to direct or encourage his proceedings. They appear to have been made in different ways: as, through dreams or visions (<a href="../../par/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-9.htm">Acts 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18-21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>); through prophets (<a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-11.htm">Acts 21:11</a>); often, no doubt, through a strong impulse borne in upon his spirit, prompting him to, or debarring him from, some particular line of conduct (<a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6, 7</a>). The journey now in question being that recorded by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, <span class="accented">init.</span>), we have to observe that St. Luke ascribes his going to a decision come to by the brethren at Antioch (<a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>). But there is no discrepancy here. It is an obvious supposition, that the apostle, taking into consideration, perhaps, the prejudice entertained against him at Jerusalem, not only, as Christ had himself intimated to him, by the unbelieving Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/22-18.htm">Acts 22:18</a>), but, as James later on confessed, by even the members of the Church itself (<a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; comp. on both points, Romans 16:31), felt at first some hesitation in accepting the commission; was he by going likely to forward their views? - but that his hesitation was overruled by Christ himself, who in some way revealed to him that it was his will that he should go. Similarly, when visiting Jerusalem for the first time after his conversion, his hasty departure from the city is attributed by St. Luke to the care of the disciples for his safety (<a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>); whereas St. Paul, in his speech from the stairs, ascribes it to a" trance," in which the Lord appearing to him bade him to depart thence without delay (<a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17, 21</a>) The two accounts in each instance are mutually supplementary, the one viewing the case historically from the outside, the other as an autobiographical reminiscence from within. The apostle's reason for thus pointedly mentioning the especial direction under which he took this journey, had evidently reference to its being the design of Christ, that thereby, together with other objects to be subserved by it, the doctrine and ministerial work of Paul should be sealed with the recognition of his first apostles and of his earliest Church - a result of prime necessity for the prosperous development of the whole Church; more important, perhaps, than even its more ostensible result as described by St. Luke. <span class="cmt_word">And communicated unto them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and I laid before them.</span> The verb occurs in the New Testament besides only in <a href="../../par/acts/25-14.htm">Acts 25:14</a>, where it means simply giving the king an account of Paul's case with the view apparently of getting his opinion upon it. In the present case St. Paul stated his doctrine to the persons referred to, with the view likewise of seeing what they would say; but certainly not with any intention of having it modified by their suggestions (cf. the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> in 2 Macc. 3:9, which presents a curiously similar conjunction of particulars).

We have the like use of the pronoun in <a href="../../par/acts/20-2.htm">Acts 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>. <span class="cmt_word">That gospel which I preach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>). The present tense of the verb points to the whole period of his ministry up to the time at which he was writing. It is implied that his teaching had been the same all along. Elsewhere he styles it "my gospel" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-8.htm">2 Timothy 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Among the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); alluding to the complexion of his doctrine as bearing upon the acceptance of Gentiles before God simply upon their faith in Christ (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1, 6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But privately</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, occurs sixteen times besides in the New Testament, always in the sense of <span class="accented">privately</span>, <span class="accented">apart</span> (cf. <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/mark/4-34.htm">Mark 4:34</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-31.htm">Mark 6:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-2.htm">Mark 9:2, 28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them which were of reputation</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">them who were of repute</span>; men eminent in repute and position. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, was used in this sense both in classical Greek and in the later "common dialect" (Eurip., 'Hec.,' 294; 'Heracl.,' 897; 'Tread.,' 617; 'Herodian,' 6:1). There is no reason to suppose that there is any tone of disparagement in the phrase, as if the persons spoken of "<span class="accented">seemed"</span> to be more than they really were.  The apostle repeats this participle thrice in the following context - once (ver. 6), as here, absolutely; and twice (vers. 6, 9) with an infinitive. This harping upon <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> suggests a surmise that St. Paul's gainsayers in Galatia had been fond of using the expression to designate the persons referred to in disparagement of himself as a man comparatively of no mark. Compare the almost mocking reiteration of "superlatively chief apostles," in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a> and 12. l 1, referring to "pseudo-apostles." In order to determine who were the persons the apostle thus distinguishes, we naturally refer to St. Luke's account of the circumstances. St. Luke, then, seems to speak of three several meetings held on this occasion. The first (in ver. 4) when Paul and Barnabas with their fellow-deputies, were "received by the Church and the apostles and the elders;" when "they [Paul and Barnabas] declared what great things God had done in co-operation with them." It cannot have been then that St. Paul gave this exposition of his gospel. But certain of the Pharisees who had joined the Church began loudly to insist upon the necessity of Gentile converts being circumcised and conforming to the Law. Whether it was at this first meeting itself that this took place, or subsequently, at all events "the apostles and the elders" judged it to be undesirable that the matter should be further discussed in so large an assemblage of the circumcision, before, in the calmer atmosphere of a private conference, they had themselves considered what course it would be best to adopt. Accordingly, St. Luke tells us (ver. 6), "the apostles and the elders came together to see about this matter." "After much discussion had taken place," which upon a question so closely touching the Jew's national sensibilities must even in this more select body have been fraught with no ordinary excitement, the rising passions of controversy were stilled by Peter; he recalled the story of Cornelius, and founding thereupon, he warned his hearers, that by imposing, as many perhaps even of those then present were wishful to do, the intolerable yoke of Mosaism upon the neck of the Gentile disciples, they ran the risk of contravening and provoking God; for after all (he significantly reminded them), their own hope of salvation, as well as the hope of Gentile believers, was that they would be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus. Thereupon the "whole company" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in ver. 12, is used by St. Luke in the same way as in his Gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1</a>) when speaking of the Sanhedrin; the eldership of the very large Church of Jerusalem must of itself, without the doubtful addition of elders from Judaean towns, have formed a considerable body) listened with hushed and respectful attention to Paul and Barnabas, while they gave a detailed account of what great signs and wonders God had wrought amongst the Gentiles through them. After this, upon James's proposition, "the apostles and the elders" came to the resolution that, in conjunction with the whole Church, they would choose and depute certain members of their community to convey to the Gentile brethren a certain letter, which very probably (cf. as to diction, vers. 17, 23, with <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-1.htm">James 1:1</a>) James himself, as presiding in their meeting, with the concurrence of the apostles and the elders, drew up. The words," with the whole Church," coming in here for the first time since ver. 4, indicate a third meeting, in which the general body of believers was prevailed upon to concur in the measures before agreed upon in the second more private meeting. According to the more approved reading of ver. 23 (omitting the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>), the letter issues from "the apostles and the elder brethren" alone, as these also were the persons with whom (ver. 2) the deputation from Antioch had been sent to confer. Now, upon the review of all the circumstances as now stated, the second of these three meetings would seem to have presented just such an opportunity as would suit the design which St. Paul had frowned, of expounding his teaching to the leading spirits in Jerusalem. When he and Barnabas were relating those signs and wonders by which the seal of Divine sanction had been put upon their ministry among the Gentiles, it was natural that Paul, here no doubt, as generally "the chief speaker," should tell their hearers with the utmost distinctness what that teaching was which Heaven had thus ratified; most especially that part of it which was so directly relevant to the practical question which was then in debate, and which is so emphatically set forth in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans - to wit, that all who believe in Christ are justified and have full peace and sonship with God without any works of Mosaical ceremonialism. This was precisely "the gospel" which here (ver. 2) he speaks of as "preached by him among the Gentiles" "The apostles and the elders" answer perfectly to the description of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>.

These last are to be conceived of rather as representative of those larger bodies of men recited in the former three references - "James" representing the elders (for the present writer makes no question but that this James "the Lord's brother" was the presiding officer or Bishop of the  Church of Jerusalem, and not one of the twelve apostles), and "Cephas and John" representing the twelve, who may be believed to have been all of them at Jerusalem at this time, though these two, certainly the leading ones, are the only ones whose names there happened to be occasion for specifying. <span class="cmt_word">Lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>).

The present tense, <span class="accented">lest I should be running</span>, points to the time of which he is writing and the time onward therefrom. In classical Greek it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, "run," "rush on," a favourite word with the apostle, well characterizes the zealous forward, speeding manner of his activity. "In vain;" to an empty result; for no good. He intimates that there had been a danger lest the fruits of his earnest work among the Gentiles, might through some cause get wrecked. That this is what he means is clear from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> just cited; and not that there had been any fear lest he might himself have been somehow mistaking his way; most especially, not lest he had been at all mistaken in the doctrine which he taught, a thing which he does not for one moment imagine. His work <span class="accented">would</span> have been in danger of being spoilt if the Gentile Churches as planted by himself had been disowned or discountenanced by the mother Church, or if they had got split up into factious parties by the intervention, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of persons coming "from James," telling them that they were not in a state of salvation. To guard against this danger, he was led by Christ himself to seek a formal recognition of his doctrine by the apostles and the elders of the Jerusalemite Church, and through them by that Church itself. As the rank-and-file of the Jewish believers at Jerusalem were even bigotedly attached to the Mosaic Law, and also regarded St. Paul himself with great suspicion, he might very easily have failed of gaining the recognition he required, if he had at once brought the matter before the general body. If their spiritual leaders had not first come forward in the cause of truth, it was but too probable that some fanatical Mosaists would have gained the ear of the multitude, and hurried them away in a course of headlong opposition to Paul and his teaching, from which it might have been very difficult afterwards to recall them.

Titus was a Gentile pure; not (like Timothy) having one parent of Jewish extraction and therefore capable of being identified with the Jewish people, but Gentile-born of both parents. The clause, '"who was with me," after ver. 1, was quite unnecessary for mere definition; in fact, it is not added for definition, but to mark the close association with an uncircumcised Gentile which the apostle openly displayed at Jerusalem. He took him with him, we may suppose, when he came before the Church at its public assemblies; when he appeared before the select meeting of the apostles and elders; when he joined the brethren in the agapae and the Lord's Supper - occasions of fraternal communion, in which the presence of a "dog," "an uncircumcised Greek," would be tenfold obnoxious. We cannot, by the way, but marvel at St. Paul's great courage in thus acting. Not only was this paraded fellowship with Titus sure to give deep offence to the vast majority of his Christian brethren, but it might also well expose him to serious personal risks among the highly inflammable populace of the city. At Jerusalem his "soul was among lions." The two clauses, "who was with me, being a Greek," illustrate the "not even." Openly displayed as was Titus's companionship with St. Paul before the eyes of all the Jews, both believers and unbelievers,and Gentile as he was known to be, yet not even in his case was circumcision persistently insisted upon. The aorist tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is significant of the ultimate result; it implies that an attempt was made to get Titus to submit to the rite, but failed. We must observe that St. Paul does not write,"I was not compelled to circumcise Titus," but "Titus was not compelled to be circumcised." This appears to make a material difference. By putting it as he has done, the apostle intimates that it was to Titus himself that the pressure was applied. Titus was plied, we may suppose, with theological argument, with appeals to his brotherly sympathies, with appeals to his prudent care for public peace, with threats of social and religious excommunication, and with stern, indignant remonstrance. But sustained, as he all through knew himself to be, by at least St, Paul, if not also by his fellow-deputies, he through it all maintained his firm stand upon his liberty. The "we" of the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 5,  no doubt, includes at least Titus. The question, however, arises - Who were they that for a while endeavoured to force circumcision upon Titus? The converts from the sect of the Pharisees, mentioned by St. Luke (<a href="../../par/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>), are naturally the first to occur to our minds. But the moulding of the sentence in the next verse discountenances this solution. We cannot help identifying the "false brethren" there spoken of with just those very Pharisean converts - men who had simply thrown the cloak of professed Christian discipleship over the old Pharisean legalism still wholly clung to. But if we suppose this, we cannot imagine that the writer would have said that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised "<span class="accented">by</span> reason of those false brethren," if these had been the very persons alluded to as having tried to compel him. It is more probable that the persons alluded to were certain influential members of the Jewish Church, with a strong body, perhaps, of the elders of that Church, having possibly the concurrence even of James and of Cephas. James and the elders, on a later occasion (<a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18-26</a>), urged Paul himself to undertake the performance of certain Mosaical observances, with the view of conciliating the believers of Jerusalem. It is, therefore, quite supposable, at this earlier and as yet immature stage in the development of the practical application of the evangelical doctrine, that Titus was now being dealt with in a somewhat similar manner. But whoever they were that were doing it, it is plain that, in effect, they were working towards the same practical result as the most eager of the Mosaist legalists, only by a different mode of approach. Titus in particular was fastened upon for this assault, apparently <span class="accented">because</span> St. Paul had brought him with him as a crucial instance whereupon to try the general question.

The rendering of our English Version represents the connection with the preceding sentence quite correctly. The designation, "false brethren," after the analogy of "false apostles," "false prophets" (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>), were those who were not really brethren in Christ, but had superinduced the profession of such over a state of mind radically incompatible with it; not children of God through faith in Christ Jesus," but only simulating faith in Christ; outwardly "baptized into Christ," but not inwardly, and therefore not really. The loud demand which those false brethren were making, that all Gentile converts should be circumcised, was distinctly rested by them upon the principle that otherwise those converts were not qualified for sonship in God's family or for admission to Church fellowship with, at any rate, the believing circumcision. This demand of theirs, made upon this pernicious principle, it was that had raised the present controversy, and had brought Paul and his fellow-deputies to Jerusalem. If, under such circumstances, Titus, with St. Paul's concurrence, had consented to be circumcised, then, whatever the motive of his consenting, it would have seemed to those false brethren, and not to them only, but indeed to the Church at large, that all had agreed in recognizing the soundness of that principle of theirs that circumcision was indispensable for perfect Divine acceptance. This consideration, we may believe, Titus and St. Paul now urged upon those who, not themselves alleging that principle, nor even allowing it to be true, yet, on other grounds, were recommending and pressing for Titus's circumcision. And the argument prevailed with them. They withdrew that pressure of theirs, and consented to leave Titus to stand there before the Church and the world, a claimant of full admission to all Christian fellowship while still in uncircumcision. It was those false brethren themselves, then, that made it impossible at the present juncture that those who held fast to the truth of the gospel should accept counsels of compromise or conciliation. In matters of indifference (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) there is a time for conciliation - this no one could ever be more ready to see and act upon than St. Paul; but there is also a time for the unbending assertion of truth, and the clamours of the false brethren made the present to be one of the latter kind. In that particular juncture of Church development, the doctrine itself of the absolute justification of men through faith in Christ was at stake. If Titus was not qualified for Christian fellowship by simply his faith in Christ, then neither was he qualified for acceptance with God by simply his faith. <span class="accented">Without warrant brought in.</span> In the compound verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>, appears to point, not so much to the manner in which they had been brought in, as <span class="accented">e.g. stealthily</span>, <span class="accented">craftily</span>, as to the circumstance that they had no business to be brought in at all; they were an <span class="accented">alien</span> brood.

The infinitive (of purpose), viewed in reference to the men themselves, can be understood only of their disposed-ness to make this use of their membership; for they can hardly be supposed to have entered into the Church for that definite object; but the apostle views them as emissaries of the great enemy; Satan's design thus to wage war with our gospel liberty (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 15</a>) is by a bold figure ascribed in this infinitive to his instruments.

In this sentence the vituperative description of the false brethren, so extended and so intensely emphatic, instead of being an implied argument in favour of the course of action which the apostle states he adopted, namely, concession to those men, both lacks all motive for its introduction here, and works wholly in favour of the opposite course, of resistance to their wishes. The only suitable and logical description of those for whose sake the concession would have been made would have been that they were brethren meaning well, but weak in the faith, who should, by concession for a season, be won over to more perfect accord with the gospel. (On this reading, see Alford, and the fuller discussion of it in Bishop Lightfoot, pp. 121-123.) <span class="accented">By subjection</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>): <span class="accented">in the way of subjection.</span> As <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;</span> In the other passages in which it occurs means the habit or spirit of subjection, and never an act of submission (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>), it probably denotes here subjection of spirit to those who were so authoritatively laying upon us their injunctions, he might give way in a point of this kind in a spirit of brotherly concession; but he would bow to no man's imperative injunction. The article before <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span> is the article before an abstract noun, as in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That the truth of the gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The truth, the sure unadulterated doctrine,  which is embodied in the gospel, and is its very hinge and substance. The same phrase is found in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>. The "truth" is that enunciated in ver. 16, and that it is the very essence of the gospel is declared <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>. The refusal of Church fellowship to a believer of this gospel except he were circumcised, by just inference vitiated and, indeed, nullified the truth that faith in Christ is the sole and sufficient ground of justification. <span class="cmt_word">Might continue with you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>). Might never cease to have its home with you, to be believingly entertained by you. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is an intensified form of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>, where see note. It is possible that, as Alford observes, the Galatians may not specially have been in St. Paul's mind at that time, but only the Gentile Churches in general; and that for greater impressiveness he applies to the particular what was only shared by it in the general. It is, however, supposable that the cases of the several Churches which he had then lately founded with Barnabas were much in his thoughts at that time; for, as is shown by his numerous references to his specific intercessory prayer, his spirit was incessantly conversant with "all the Churches" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>); and he was anxiously cognizant of efforts made from the very first by legalizing Christians to pervert their faith. It is not certain that <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> records the first occasion of his visiting the "Galatic country;" he may have been there and founded "the Churches of Galatia" before the occurrences described in <a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; and the opinion is even held by many that Iconium and Derbe, belonging to the Roman province of Galatia, were two of "the Churches of Galatia" (see Introduction, p. 2). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed <i>to be somewhat</i> in conference added nothing to me:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But of these who seemed to be somewhat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">now from those who were reputed to be somewhat.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> does not seem to be adversative here, but simply introductory of a new particular. The writer is about to introduce, which he does in the next five verses (6-10), a fresh illustration of the independent position, which in point both of doctrine and of ministerial footing he held in relation to the first apostles and to the heads of the Jerusalemite Church, and at the same time of the full recognition which in both respects these had accorded to him. The construction of this sentence, as it proceeds, is interrupted and changed. When St. Paul wrote, <span class="accented">from those who were reputed to be somewhat</span>, he would seem to have meant to add, "I received nothing fresh either in knowledge of the gospel or in authority as Christ's minister," or some-tiring to that effect; but in his indignant parenthesis asserting his independence with respect to those whom his gainsayers in Galatia would seem to have pronounced his superiors, both in knowledge and in office, he loses sight of the beginning of the sentence, and begins it afresh in another form with the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="accented">for they who were of repute</span>, etc. <span class="accented">Reputed to be somewhat</span>; that is, thought highly cf. The phrase is of frequent occurrence, both in Greek and in Latin authors. It is obvious that he refers to the twelve and the leaders of the mother Church of Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of what sort they at any time were maketh no matter to me.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (of what sort) is suggested by the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> (somewhat), and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> (they were) by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (reputed); from those reputed to be somewhat whatever they really were. The comparison of the usage of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in other passages (<a href="../../par/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-18.htm">1 Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-24.htm">James 1:24</a>) hardly favours the specific interpretation, "how great." In respect to the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>, in a classical author, as Bishop Light foot observes, we should have no hesitation in taking it as equivalent to <span class="accented">cunque.</span> But the word occurs in the New Testament in thirty-one ether places, and in not one is it <span class="accented">eunque</span>, but always the adverb of time, either "sometime," "in time past," as above, <a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-13.htm">John 9:13</a>; or "any time," as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a>. The latter shade of meaning seems the more appropriate here. The <span class="accented">any time</span>, though not to be limited to, would, however, cover the time when the twelve were in personal attendance upon our Lord - a circumstance which St. Paul's detractors were no doubt wont to hold up as a mark of distinction not possessed by him. It seems best to take of <span class="accented">what sort</span> as dependent upon the following words, <span class="accented">maketh no matter to me.</span> This last clause is not exactly equivalent to "I care not," as if it were an almost supercilious waving aside of the consideration; it is rather a grave assertion of a matter of fact. Whatever were the gifts of knowledge and spiritual insight which the twelve or other heads of the Jerusalemite Church possessed, or whatever their ministerial privileges or authority, whether derived from personal intercourse with the Lord Jesus when upon earth or in any other way, Paul's knowledge of the gospel and Paul's apostolic authority were neither of them at all affected by them. Now, at the time that he is writing this Epistle, he was just the same in respect to the possession of the essential truth of the gospel and to his apostolic authority as if he had had no intercourse with the spiritual rulers of the Jewish Church. <span class="cmt_word">God accepteth no man's person</span>  (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The order of the words in the Greek throws especial emphasis upon "person:" <span class="accented">person of man God accepteth not</span>; that is, it is never on account of his person that God accepteth a man. This phrase, "accept a man's person," is of frequent occurrence in the Bible. In the New Testament it is always used in a bad sense, which in the Old is by no means the case. This difference is due, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, to the secondary sense of <span class="accented">actor's mask</span> attaching to the Greek noun, the actor on the Greek stage, as also on the Roman, being wont to wear a mask suited to the character in which he appeared; whence also <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> got to signify this character itself. The corresponding technical term among the Romans was <span class="accented">persona</span>, a word never used of the natural face, as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> was. This explains the adoption of this last term in its Anglicized form by our English translators in the phrase now before us. With the like metaphorical application of the idea as that which was so common among the Romans, the word "<span class="accented">per</span>son" seemed well fitted to denote the part, or certain accessories of the part, which a man plays on the stage, so to speak, of human life, in contradistinction to his more interior and essential character. The phrase denotes accepting a man, for example, for his worldly rank or position, for his office, for his nationality, even for his Church status (see <a href="../../par/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-17.htm">1 Peter 1:17</a>). The special adjuncts of a man's <span class="accented">person</span> referred to in the present passage are those of the outward call aforetime to be apostles and personal attendants upon the Lord Jesus while upon earth, and, in the case of St. James the Lord's brother, personal relationship to him. And St. Paul means to intimate that <span class="accented">his</span> knowledge of Divine truth and <span class="accented">his</span> ministerial fidelity and efficiency might be as real and as great, if God's will were so, as the knowledge and ministerial fidelity and efficiency of the twelve and St. James, whom his gainsayers were honouring so far above him merely for their <span class="accented">person's</span> sake. God made no such difference between him and them, but wrought with him just as much. <span class="cmt_word">For they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">for to me they who were of repute in conference added nothing.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, as it stands here, appears related to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 2. I laid before them my gospel; they imparted to me nothing fresh (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). Thus Chrysostom and Theodoret. In <a href="../../par/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>, where the same verb occurs (see note), there is nothing to accentuate the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as there is here. The "for" appears related to the foregoing clause. That God does not respect man for his person was evidenced by the fact that Paul's knowledge of the gospel was already so complete and his work was so honoured by God, that those whose <span class="accented">person</span> seemed to many so markedly superior to his, found that all they had to do was to frankly recognize his teaching as already adequate and complete, and his work as standing on a perfectly equal footing with their own.

A few of them, no doubt, were apprised of it previously, Cephas in particular (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a> and note); but the majority of that assemblage of apostles and elders knew Paul chiefly by hearsay, and hearsay not always the most friendly to him.

The perfect is used and not the aorist (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), as marking the then still continuing holding of the trust, and also perhaps, as implying the con-tinning identity of the doctrine preached.

Nevertheless, in the main, Peter was the head of the Church of the circumcised, Paul of that of the uncircumcised. But how completely the substance of Peter's doctrine was one with that of Paul's is strikingly evinced by his two Epistles (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). It is difficult to feel that St. Paul could have written as he here does, if he was aware that St. Peter had been constituted by the Lord Jesus to be his own vicar upon earth, supreme over the whole Church and all its ministers.

God wrought on Peter's behalf for apostleship of the circumcision; that is, towards, in furtherance of, his work as their apostle, by constituting him their apostle, by making his ministry effectual in turning their hearts to Christ, and by miracles wrought by his hands, including the impartation through him of miraculous gifts to his converts; for such were "the signs of the apostle" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">had wrought also on my behalf towards the Gentiles.</span> Comp. <a href="../../par/acts/15-12.htm">Acts 15:12</a>, "They hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) among the Gentiles by them;" where likewise, as here, the aorist tense is used of action they were then looking back upon as past.

This is the order in which the words stand in the Greek, in which the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("perceiving of a certainty") stands co-ordinate with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> ("when they saw") of ver. 7, so that this latter participle has "James, Cephas, and John" for its subject equally with the former, and vers. 7 and 9 appear as forming one sentence. The expression, "the grace that was given unto me," occurs also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-10.htm">1 Corinthians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; in which passages, as well as here, it is used with a definite reference to the office of apostle having been conferred upon him together with the qualification and aid for its efficient discharge. This definite reference to a heavenly gift connected with his official character is prominent in the apostle's use of the word "grace," also in <a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. The "grace that was given unto him," therefore, sums up the facts of his having been put in trust of the gospel of the uncircumcision, and of God's having wrought on his behalf in his discharge of that trust, which are presented in the two preceding verses. There is not much difference in the meaning of the participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in this verse as compared with the participle <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 7; for as we find the verb "seeing" used with reference to objects not discernible by the bodily sense but perceived only through the medium of evidencing facts, as in ver. 14 of this chapter, and in <a href="../../par/luke/9-47.htm">Luke 9:47</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; so also the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is sometimes used of perceiving, becoming apprised of, some fact, as <a href="../../par/mark/6-38.htm">Mark 6:38</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-11.htm">Luke 9:11</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9</a>, when there is no clear intention of emphasizing the idea of certain knowledge. Sometimes, however, it seems as if the writer had such intention, as in <a href="../../par/mark/8-17.htm">Mark 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-45.htm">Mark 15:45</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-46.htm">Luke 8:46</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-19.htm">Philippians 2:19</a>; and probably it was in this more emphatic sense that the apostle here substituted "knowing" for the foregoing "seeing." "James, and Cephas, and John." This James is, no doubt, the same James as appears in <a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>. holding so prominent and apparently presidential a position in the great meeting of vers. 6-21. The "James" of the old triumvirate of the Gospels, "Peter, James, and John," was now no more. This James, whose personality has been discussed above in note on Galatians 1:19, is named first, before even  Cephas and John, though not an apostle, as being the leading "elder" (<span class="accented">bishop</span>, as such a functionary soon got to be designated) of the Church of Jerusalem; for in the classification of the component members of that meeting in <a href="../../par/acts/15-6.htm">Acts 15:6</a>, "the apostles and the elders," James must be assigned to the latter category. The twelve had no distinctive official connection with this particular Church more than with other Churches; and, therefore, in meetings held at Jerusalem, the presidential position would naturally be conceded, not to any one of the apostles, but to the man who was statedly recognized as the superior "elder" of this particular community. St. John's name is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>; but in other places in St. Luke's history "Peter and John" are found acting in conjunction, and this in such a manner as to betoken their holding a very prominent place among the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14</a>). The reason why these three are named, and none but these, is probably that on the occasion referred to these three alone - James as on behalf of the Church of Jerusalem, and Peter and John as on behalf of the twelve - stepped forward at the general request before the meeting, and formally all three clasped hands with Paul and Barnabas in token of their recognizing and ratifying their doctrine and ministry. In reference to the name "Cephas,' it may be observed that St. Paul finds occasion to name this apostle nine times; in seven of these he writes, according to the best manuscripts, "Cephas' (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-18.htm">Galatians 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9, 14</a>); in two, "Peter" (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). The Judaizers in the Church, whether at Corinth or in Galatia, in their morbid hankering after whatever was distinctively Jewish, were sure to affect the use of the Hebraic form; on which account, probably, St. Paul, in dealing with these men, is seen so frequently using this form himself. <span class="accented">Those reputed to be pillars.</span> The apostle's object in adding this clause is apparently, to indicate why these three, rather than any others, represented the rest in this act of formal proceeding, and at the same time to intimate to his Galatian readers the supreme character of the attestation thus afforded, both to that gospel of his which certain among the Galatians were now tampering with, and to his official character which those same persons were beginning to disparage. "Pillars." The apostle, years after, in writing to Timothy, speaks of its being the proper function of "the Church of the living God" that she should be "a pillar and settled basis (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the truth," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upholding the truth (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>). This suggests to us his meaning in using the same figure here. Those three men were by general consent looked up to as especially steadfast upholders of the truth of the gospel or of the Christian cause. In <a href="../../par/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a> the "pillar" seems thought of, not so much as upholding a superstructure as of something itself stationary, and also, perhaps, beautiful and glorious. Clement of Rome, in his Epistle to the Corinthians (&sect; 5), borrows the phrase with a more extensive application. The idea couched in the word "Cephas," <span class="accented">rock</span>, is so nearly identical with that of "settled basis," that the like affinity of ideas as led the apostle to connect "pillar" with the latter term in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a> may be supposed to have led him now to connect "pillar" with "Cephas" and his two illustrious brethren. <span class="cmt_word">They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); they each of them clasped each of us by the right hand, in token that they both did then, and would thereafter continue to, regard us, and we also them, as partners with one another in a common work. We meet with the phrases, "give right hands," "receive right hands," in 1 Macc. 11:50, 52 1 Macc. 13:50, with reference, apparently, to the victor conceding, and the vanquished accepting, terms of peace to be ratified by the mutual clasp of right hands. This, however, is not precisely what is meant in the present case; there is no room here for the notion of reconciliation. Neither seems there intended a signification of love, such as the "kiss of love" would have afforded. This hand-clasp simply ratified by a palpable gesture the formal assurance between the two parties that they regarded each other as friendly partners in a common undertaking. That the use of this gesture in ratifying compact has been very common in all ages, is shown by the instances in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon' (<span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and in Facciolati ("Dextra"), as well as by Bishop Light feet's note on the present passage. Its use among the Jews is attested, not only by the very phrase employed here and in the Maccabees, but by the phrases, "strike hands" and "give one's hand," in <a href="../../par/job/17-3.htm">Job 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-1.htm">Proverbs 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>. Josephus's remark in 'Ant.,' 18. 9:3, on the unique inviolability which the Persians, Parthians, and other Oriental nations felt to attach to engagements thus ratified, by no means precludes the supposition that Jews used this gesture of guarantee, but only shows that it was not with them the most sacred of all forms of covenanting: they would, of course, regard an oath by the Name of God as affording a higher sanction. In the case now under consideration there was no "strife" between James, Cephas, and John, and Paul and Barnabas, which needed to be "ended" by "an oath:" the solemn and cordial mutual pressure of the right hand seems just the kind and measure  of form appropriate to the circumstances<span class="cmt_word">. That we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">that we unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the Gentiles</span>, <span class="accented">and themselves unto</span> (or, <span class="accented">for</span>) <span class="accented">the circumcision</span>, without any verb. We have a very similar ellipsis of the verb in a carefully balanced antithesis, and before the same preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, in <a href="../../par/romans/5-16.htm">Romans 5:16</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14</a>). We may read it either thus, "should go unto," as in both the Authorized and the Revised Versions; or, "should be ministers for," taking the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> with the like shade of meaning, as in ver. 8. This distribution of the several provinces of work is shown by the subsequent practice on both sides (see note on ver. 7, <span class="accented">subfin.</span>) to have been intended to be geographical rather than national; which understanding is also indicated by the mention in the next verse of "the poor" whom Paul and Barnabas were, notwithstanding this distribution, to bear in mind; they were the poor <span class="accented">in Judaea</span>, the province of James, Cephas, and John.

(For the order of the words in the Greek, comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-4.htm">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>.) If there is the ellipsis of any participle at all which needs to be supplied, which many critics suppose, though Meyer not unplausibly thinks otherwise, perhaps "stipulating" presents itself more readily than either "willing" or "requesting;" for this <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> depends as much upon the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> as the preceding <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> does, and therefore seems to introduce something as much as that a part of the compact. What the apostle means is this: "In one respect only did this mutual compact of equal brotherly partnership leave us who were ministers of the Gentiles unfree in relation to the circumcision and their ministers; we consented to allow ourselves bound to be mindful of the duty of helping their poor. In all other respects, we were to still pursue the same plan of evangelization as we had been pursuing, with no modification of either our doctrine or Church practice; with no such modification, for example, as these false brethren were clamouring for." St. Paul's methods of work thus received the full sanction of the "pillars," being recognized by them as standing on the same level of truth and heavenly guidance as their own. <span class="cmt_word">The same which I also was forward to do</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">the very thing this which I was even of myself zealous to do.</span> The as; makes prominent the notion of intense earnestness, which St. Paul is wont to express in the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, as well as of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. He did not merely <span class="accented">consent to</span> bear in mind the poor of Judaea; apart from such stipulation, apart from regard to any request of James, Cephas, and John, it was a matter which of himself he regarded as one of very great importance, demanding his most earnest attention. The especial force of this verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is evinced by <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-17.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-15.htm">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; and especially by <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-16.htm">2 Corinthians 8:16, 17</a>, in which the frame of mind it expresses is distinguished, as here, from that of mere willingness to consent to another person's request. The principal reason for making this matter so prominent lay, no doubt, in the great distress prevailing amongst the poor in Judaea, justifying the application of the principle stated in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14, 15</a> (see Stanley's note on 1 Corinthians 16:1). But we can hardly err in supposing that, as a subsidiary motive, both the leaders of the Jewish Church and St. Paul himself were greatly influenced by the consideration that such practical manifestation of Christian sympathy would both evince, and help to cement, the unity with each other of the Jewish and Gentile Churches. It was this organic unity which constituted the <span class="accented">obligation</span> of rendering such assistance (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/15-27.htm">Romans 15:27</a> with <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17, 18</a>). How perseveringly and how earnestly the apostle strove to aid the poor of the Jewish Churches both before and after the conference here spoken of, is seen in <a href="../../par/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> (where reference is made to collections in Galatia); <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>. Since in this last cited passage it is only incidentally that St. Luke is led to mention the collection which St. Paul brought with him in that journey of his to Jerusalem recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>, it is quite supposable that he brought collections with him also in that former visit merely glanced at in <a href="../../par/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>. We may surmise that St. Paul has a special purpose in mentioning to the Galatians this particular item of that important compact. In his First Epistle to the Corinthians, written at no long interval whether before or after the sending of this letter, he tells them (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>) that he had given order to the Churches of Galatia respecting the manner in which <span class="accented">they</span> should collect for this object. It seems the more probable supposition that those directions were not given until this letter had had the happy effect of restoring better relations between himself and them than he was able at present to reckon upon. Meanwhile, however, this historical reference would serve to prepare them in some measure for the appeal, when he should think it  prudent to make it (cf. Introduction, pp. 16-18.). It is well to observe, in reference to this whole passage (vers. 6-10), the extent to which the apostle goes in identifying Barnabas's position with his own. Barnabas had laboured with himself as evangelizing "apostle" sent forth with himself from the Antiochian Church, and both before and. after that missionary journey in the neighbourhood of Antioch itself. Accordingly he tells his readers that the "pillars" had without qualification recognized the work of them both and had fraternally greeted their further prosecution of it. But it is of himself alone that he speaks when he contrasts Cephas's apostleship of the circumcision with his own apostleship (for this is implied) to the Gentiles. The reason for this is that Barnabas was not an apostle in that other higher sense of the term in which Cephas and himself were (see Introduction, Dissertation I.). Again, when mentioning the stipulation which the "pillars" made, that we should be mindful of their poor, he does not add, "the very thing this which we were of ourselves resolved to do," but makes the observation with reference to himself only. This is explained by the unhappy rupture which St. Luke tells of as so soon after occurring between them - which account of St. Luke's finds thus here a latent confirmation. What we otherwise know of Barnabas's character leaves no room to doubt but that he too zealously set himself to carry out the stipulation in that separate sphere of work among Gentiles which, after the rupture, he engaged in. But this is no longer St. Paul's business, while relating facts falling under his own cognizance. And this consideration throws light upon the time of the action expressed by the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>: it does not mean, "I <span class="accented">had already before been</span> forward to do so;" for then he would not have left out Barnabas; but, "thenceforward in my whole subsequent career I zealously made it my business," the aorist embracing the whole in one view. Further, our attention is arrested by the extreme importance and the pregnant significance of the incident here related. Here was one who, neither directly nor indirectly, owed to those who had been previously sent forth by Heaven as teachers of the gospel, either his conversion, or his knowledge of the Christian doctrine, or his mission to preach; but had nevertheless gone forth proclaiming what he affirmed to be Christ's gospel communicated to him by Divine revelation, gathering disciples to be baptized into Christ, and combining such disciples into Churches. In what relation did this doctrine of Paul and the Church organizations which he was setting on foot in the Gentile world stand to the doctrine of the twelve and to the Church organizations framed by them in connection therewith at Jerusalem and in Judaea? These last were assumed to be from heaven; were those more recent phenomena, of doctrines taught and societies formed by Paul, in harmony with the previous ones? Unquestionably and glaringly there were important differences between the external religious life of the twelve and the Jewish believers, and the external religious life which Paul taught the Gentile Churches to adopt. The twelve and the Jewish Christians in general still practised in their daily life the usages of Mosaism, blending the use of such outward forms and ceremonies as appertained to Christian discipleship with those older habits of life preserved intact; in the Gentile Church as moulded by Paul the usages of Mosaism were altogether wanting. Was the seal of Heaven to be recognized as affixed to the Pauline doctrine and the Pauline Church life, as certainly as it was seen to be affixed to the doctrine of the twelve and the Judaeo-Christian Church life? Yes. The verdict of the great leaders of the Jewish Church decided for the full recognition of the Pauline doctrine and the Pauline Church life as in root and essence identical with their own, and as equally with their own derived from heaven. It was a decision come to in the teeth of intense and deeply ingrained prejudices prompting to the adoption of a different conclusion; and must have been due to overpowering evidence leaving them no alternative, seconded we may believe by the secret swaying of their souls by the Holy Ghost. We cannot help reflecting <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> how disastrous the effects would have been of a decision of another kind; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how remarkably is here illustrated the essential oneness of the Christian life amidst most extreme diversity in its outward manifestation; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> what a strong attestation is afforded to the certain truth of the gospel, revealed to the world through two wholly distinct channels of communication, which yet concurred in delivering what was in reality one and the same message. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - In the narrative which the apostle next proceeds to give, several points, we may suppose, were definitely meant by him to be intimated to his readers. Thus to those Gentile Galatians who were wavering in their attachment to himself and to the gospel which he had preached to them, he shows his claim to their firm affectionate adherence, on the ground of the steadfastness with which, as before at Jerusalem so now afresh in Antioch, he had successfully asserted their rights and their equal standing  with Jewish believers, when these were assailed by "certain come from James." In contrast with his own unflinching championship of their cause, were here seen vacillation and inconsistency on the part of "Cephas;" were, then, any justified in exalting those "pillars, James and Cephas," as certain were disposed to do, for the sake of disparaging <span class="accented">him</span>? This experience at Antioch should lead them to regard with suspicion Jewish or Philo-Judaic brethren, who were setting themselves to tamper with the truth of the gospel. Crooked conduct was sure to accompany such darkening of the truth, as on that occasion was most palpably evinced in the case of even Barnabas, and was in open encounter before the whole Church exposed and rebuked. And, especially, there was the grand principle that the Law of Moses was for the Christian believer annihilated through the crucifixion of Christ; which principle he had then held aloft in the view of the Church, and here takes occasion to enlarge upon, because it was so directly relevant and helpful in respect to the trouble now springing up in Galatia. <span class="cmt_word">But when Peter was come to Antioch</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but when Cephas came to Antioch.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is generally accepted. The time at which this incident took place is in a measure determined, on the one side, by its being to all appearance after the visit to Jerusalem which has been previously spoken of, and, on the other, by the reference to Barnabas in ver. 13; that is, we are naturally led to assign it to that time of Paul's, and Barnabas's united labours at Antioch which is briefly indicated in <a href="../../par/acts/15-35.htm">Acts 15:35</a>. It can hardly have occurred subsequently to the rupture between them which St. Luke immediately after describes. The manner in which St. Peter's coming to Antioch is introduced seems to betoken that his coming thither was not felt to have been at all an extraordinary circumstance. It is open to us, and indeed obvious, to conjecture that the visit was made in the course of one of those journeyings of St. Peter "throughout all parts," of which <span class="accented">another</span>, taking place fourteen years or more previously, is mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/9-33.htm">Acts 9:33</a>. As the "apostle of the circumcision," he was, we may reasonably suppose, in the habit of traversing, in company often with his wife (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>), the whole of those districts of Palestine which were largely inhabited by Jews, and extending as far as Antioch itself, in the exercise of apostolic supervision over the Jewish converts. Quite supposably, this was not his first visit to this city. The lengthened continuance of his stay, which may be inferred from ver. 12, is thus explained. It may be assumed that it was this exercise of apostolic superintendence that gave rise to the tradition, which gained early acceptance in the Church (Eusebius, ' Hist. Eccl.,' 3:36), that Peter was the first Bishop of Antioch. His presence there now, while St. Paul was also there, found, probably, its analogy, twelve or fourteen years later, in the simultaneous presence of St. Peter and St. Paul at Rome; St.. Peter being there also, we may suppose, in the discharge of his office as apostle of the circumcision. <span class="cmt_word">I withstood him to the face</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). I seized an opportunity at a meeting of the brethren (ver. 14) of publicly confronting him as an adversary. It seems almost suggested that their spheres of work at Antioch, which was a very large city, were so far not identical that they were not commonly to be seen together. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">set</span> myself to oppose him," expressing deter mined oppugnancy (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-9.htm">1 Peter 5:9</a>), strikes us the more, as coming so soon after the "gave us the right hands of fellowship of ver. 7. His adopting of this mode of recalling his straying brother instead of dealing with him in a more private manner, is indicated with an evidently intended pointedness. His course of proceeding was both justified and required by the public nature of St. Peter's offence, and by the necessity of promptly exposing and beating back the aggressions which Israelitish bigotry was always so ready to make upon the perfectly equal footing possessed by all believers, by virtue simply of their relation to Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Because he was to be blamed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">because he stood condemned.</span> The perfect passive verb is commonly felt to point, not so much to the censures of bystanders, as to the glaring wrongness of his conduct viewed in itself (comp. <a href="../../par/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-23.htm">Romans 14:23</a>). The rendering <span class="accented">to be blamed</span>, correct so far as it reaches, is inadequate in expressing the sense which St. Paul had of the <span class="accented">gravity</span> of St. Peter's offence. It is interesting to note the clear reference to this verse made in the second century by the Ebionite author of the ' Clementine Homilies,' who (Bishop Lightfoot observes, 'Galatians,' p. 61), writing in a spirit of bitter hostility to St. Paul, who is covertly attacked in the person of Simon Magus, represents St. Peter as addressing Simon thus: "Thou hast confronted and withstood me (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>).

Not only is this a testimony to the authenticity of.. the Epistle; it betokens also the  sore feeling which this narrative of St. Paul's and the manner of its diction left behind in the minds of a certain section of Jewish Christians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">Judaism of the earliest Pentecostal Church not rabbinical.</span> Any one who will be at the pains of reviewing the contents of the four Gospels with an eye to this particular subject, cannot fail to be struck by the frequency with which Christ in his own conduct placed himself in even the sharpest antagonism to the "traditions of the eiders," and encouraged his disciples in likewise setting them at nought. And this he did in cases in which the contrast of his behaviour to the abject submission to those traditions paraded by the Pharisees must have been most striking, and have jarred, no doubt, very often even painfully, upon the ill-instructed religious sensibilities of those, who had grown up in the belief that to observe the traditions was both seemly and pious and to neglect them unseemly and schismatical. For example, in daily life, neither he nor his disciples would "baptize" themselves when coming home from the market, nor even apply lustral water to their hands before taking a meal, though there before their eyes stood tire vessels filled with water which had been provided for the guests and which the other guests were punctual in using. It was not without significance that in his first miracle he withdrew the water which had been set apart for such lustrations from one use of it which he would pronounce to be utterly frivolous and vain, to apply it to one which should really be serviceable and beneficent. Again, many were the restrictions which the traditions imposed upon men's actions on the sabbath - restrictions which not only were additional to those enjoined by the Law, but also in many cases contravened the calls of mercy and benevolence. Such restrictions Christ very frequently, and in the most public and pointed manner, so as to directly challenge attention to what he did, broke through, and taught his disciples to disregard; the Pharisees being repeatedly so enraged at these transgressions of the traditions as to endeavour in consequence to take his life. The fastings enjoined by the traditions, he and his disciples likewise offended the Pharisees by taking no account cf. The traditions of especially one popular school of teaching allowed so great a facility of divorce as served to disguise a frightful excess of licentiousness, in which many of the Pharisees were themselves implicated; in opposition to which Christ was wont publicly to declare that 'connections formed after divorces not justified by adultery were themselves adulterous. Continually was the Lord warning his followers against the leaven of Pharisaism, to wit, its ostentation in religious observances; its laying so much stress upon the outward act, in neglect of the inward motive and the posture of the spirit; its draining away the forces of moral earnestness from the prosecution of justice, mercy, and truth, to squander them upon scrupulous and vigilant devotion to the veriest trifles of formalism; the consequent hollowness and hypocrisy of the religious character of its votaries; their love of money; their eagerness for social distinction; their cruelty to the poor amid all their ostentatious almsgiving; their hardheartedness to the fallen; their intense, devilish hatred of real piety. All the four Gospels abound in indications of that antipathy to Pharisaism and traditionalism which Christ both entertained himself and was careful to instil into the minds of his disciples. It cannot, therefore, be questioned that the disciples who formed the first nucleus of the Christian community, especially the twelve and the brethren of the Lord, were animated by similar sentiments of anti-Pharisaism; and so also the Pentecostal Church at Jerusalem as moulded under their influence. The Law of Moses, no doubt, they continued to obey, as their Master had done - the Law of Moses, however, as construed in the more humane and spiritual sense put upon it by the Sermon on the Mount, and not as stiffened and hardened into intolerable cruelty by the rabbinism which the Pharisees insisted upon. Such, we may feel certain, had been the attitude of St. Peter's mind in reference to the Law when, years before at Joppa, he had received the summons to go and visit Cornelius at Caesarea. It was with constraint put upon his own hitherto cherished tastes that he submitted to the call; and when he entered the Gentile's house, the fibre of Israelitism in his soul is seen quivering, shrinking back from the step which he was compelled to take. "Ye yourselves know," he said to the company of uncircumcised men among whom he found himself, "that it is an  unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to join himself or to come unto one of another nation; and yet unto me hath God showed that I should not call any man common or unclean." It was painful to him as an Israelite and a Mosaist; but God's declared will was leaving him no alternative. Now, whence had arisen those feelings of repulsion? Partly it was, no doubt, a kind of caste sentiment. It had been then more than two thousand years a traditional consciousness with the Hebrew race that their circumcision lifted them to a higher level than the rest of mankind stood upon; and the persuasion inspired them with a disdain of uncircumcised nations, which with the most had little or no admixture of really religious feeling, being felt by the idolatrous Ephraimites as well as by the less unfaithful children of Judah. With the more pious members of the nation, this repulsion from Gentiles was partly the outcome of their sense of the deep degradation, religious and moral, in which heathen nations were sunk, steeped as they were in idolatry; but their sense of this was greatly intensified by the moral effect of the separation from other nations enforced by the ceremonial law. This was effected partly by the distinction between clean and unclean animals, which, recognized in an elementary degree as early as the time of Noah, was made in the Levitical legislation a matter of very minutely definite prescription (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>.); and partly by the prohibition of eating either certain kinds of fat (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>) or blood: to partake either of the flesh of an unclean animal, or of suet or blood, was emphatically declared by the Law, and by the long-inherited tradition of the nation had grown to be instinctively felt to be, "defilement" and "abomination." There is no ground for supposing that St. Peter's shrinking back from Gentiles as common or unclean was caused by rabbinism. Rabbin-ism, no doubt, added much to the bitterness of the repulsion with these who served the traditions; but even where there was no bondage owned to the dicta of the elders, repulsion from the contact of a Gentile was a powerful sentiment, having its roots deep in the instinctive sentiments of the Hebrew race and in the feelings instilled by the peremptory enactments of the Divine Law. Now, however, in Cornelius's house, St. Peter does not allow his spirit to be dominated by sentiments such as these. God and Christ his Master were making it manifest, as in other ways, so especially by the astonishing illapse of the Holy Spirit into these believing hearers of the gospel message, that they <span class="accented">were</span> no longer unclean, and therefore he cannot possibly any longer treat them as unclean. He tarried with them certain days, and, according to the charge immediately after preferred against him and not denied, ate with them. That he partook of the same food as they, whether of a kind forbidden by the Mosaic Law or not, is not stated and is no necessary inference drawn from the circumstances. He would not, we may well believe, scruple now to recline at the same table with them; but it may be readily imagined that for a guest so highly revered, of whose Jewish sensibilities respecting food they could not be unaware, even if he or the six Jewish brethren who accompanied him from Joppa did not make a point of apprising them, the wealthy centurion and his family would be only too anxious to provide such food as both he and his fellow-visitors would find acceptable. Thus St. Peter might have "eaten bread" with the Gentiles, neither, on the one hand, himself breaking the Levitical Law by partaking of food which was forbidden to him as a child of the legal covenant, nor, on the other, declining to recognize the full acceptableness before God and the equal brotherhood in Christ of believers who were still in their uncircumcision. The caste feeling of proud disdain of uncircumcised men as men of an inferior grade, and the dread of ceremonial defilement from contact with those who were levitically unclean, dared no longer assert themselves, could, indeed, no longer be permitted to lodge in his bosom, in the face of the clear proof which had been afforded that the Almighty had in Christ adopted them as his own children equally with himself. Thus it appears that when at Antioch, at the time here referred to by St. Paul, Cephas was seen partaking of social meals in company with the Gentile converts, he was only acting in the same way as he had acted at Caesarea ten years before. <p> <p>

When, in the vision at Joppa, unclean animals together with clean were offered to him for food, he had answered, "Not so, Lord; for! have never eaten anything that is common and unclean." This shows that, up to that time, the personal teachings of Christ when he was upon earth had not relieved his mind of the sense that to use certain kinds of meat was for him an unlawful thing. The heavenly rejoinder, "What God hath cleansed, make not thou common," appears to have been understood by him with reference, at least in the first instance, to human beings (<a href="../../par/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28</a>). There seems to be no doubt that the habit of mind generated by long subjection to the Levitical Law.  producing repugnance to Gentiles as habitually using unclean meats, he brought with him when crossing Cornelius's threshold; and that it is quite supposable that, in "eating with Gentiles" while his visit to Cornelius continued, he had had no occasion to break through those barriers of restriction which the Law of itself imposed. But, on the other hand, it is also quite supposable that the answer made to him in the vision had, if not at once, at least later, led him on to the further conviction that God had now made all kinds of meat lawful for a Christian's use, although, when consorting, as in the main he had to do, with Jews, he would still bow to the Levitical restrictions. The Petrine Gospel of St. Mark appears, according to the now by many accepted reading of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the text of Mark 7:19, to have stated that Christ in teaching, "Whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him," had said this, "making all meats clean." There is no question that in St. Paul's own view at that epoch of his ministry when he wrote this Epistle, "nothing," to use his own words, "is unclean of itself" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 25</a>); and we have no reason to doubt that he had "been in the Lord Jesus persuaded" of this long before, - at the very outset probably of his ministry. It is, therefore, not unlikely that this same persuasion of the real indifferency of all kinds of meat had been by Christ instilled into St. Peter's mind as well. But if it were thus in respect to the use of meats, it would be thus also in reference to all other kinds of purely ceremonial restriction. Very shortly before these occurrences at Antioch, St. Peter had at Jerusalem openly and strongly expressed the feeling which he experienced, how intolerably galling were the restraints imposed by the Levitical, not to say by the rabbinical, ceremonialism; "a yoke," he said, "which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear " - language which seems to betoken a mind which had spiritually been set at liberty from the yoke. On the whole, the inference naturally suggested by St. Paul's words, "Thou livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews," commends itself as the true one; namely this - that St. Peter, not on that occasion only, but also on others, when thrown into contact with masses of Gentile converts, was wont to assert his Christian liberty; that, like as St. Paul did, so did he: while, on the one hand, to the Jews he became as a Jew, to them under the Law as under the Law, that he might gain the Jews, gain them that were under the Law, so also, on the other, to them that were without Law he became as without Law, that he might gain also them (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20, 21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>;). In place of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, why, recent editions read, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, how, which is a more emphatic interrogatory with a tinge of wonderment; as if it were, "How is it possible that?' (so <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12</a>). The verb "Judaize" occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/esther/8-17.htm">Esther 8:17</a>, "And many of the Gentiles had themselves circumcised and Judaized (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) by reason of their fear of the Jews." It is plainly equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x3bd;</span>. Compellest, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> settest thyself to compel. The "compulsion" applied by Cephas was a moral compulsion; he was, in effect, withholding front them Christian fellowship, unless they Judaized. Put into words, his conduct said this: "If you will Judaize, I will hold fellowship with you; if you will not, you are not qualified for full fraternal recognition from me." The withholding of Christian fraternization, short of formal Church excommunication such as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3-5</a>, is a powerful engine of Christian influence, the use of which is distinctly authorized and even commanded in Scripture (<a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10</a> 2John 10), and may on occasion be employed by private Christians on their own responsibility. But its use, when not clearly justified, is not only a cruelty to our brethren, but an outrage upon what St. Paul here calls the truth of the gospel. It is at our peril that we grieve, by a cold or unbrotherly bearing towards him, one whom we have reason to believe God has "received" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-7.htm">Romans 15:7</a>). If God in Christ owns and loves him as a son, we ought to frankly own and love him as a brother.

With this correction of the text, we may either make this fifteenth verse a separate sentence, by supplying <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, "we are Jews by nature," etc., and begin the next verse with the words, "but yet, knowing that...  even we believed," etc.; or we may supply in this verse" being," and, conjoining it with "knowing," take the two verses as forming one sentence; thus: "We being Jews... yet knowing that... even we believed," etc. For the general sense, it is quite immaterial which mode of construing we adopt. The Revisers have preferred the latter. The former makes the passage run more smoothly; but this, in construing St. Paul's writings, is by no means a consideration of weight. "We," that is, "I Paul, and thou Cephas," rather than "I Paul, and thou Cephas, with those who  are acting with thee;" for we read before, "I said unto Cephas," not" unto Cephas and the rest of the Jews." "By nature;" because we were Jews by birth. But the two expressions, "by nature" and "by birth," are not convertible terms, as is evident from ch. 4:8 and <a href="../../par/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>; the former covers wider ground than the latter. The prerogatives attaching to the natural position of a born Jew were higher than those which appertained to a circumcised proselyte. This is why he adds," by nature." "Jews;" a term of honourable distinction, closely by its etymology connected in the mind of a Hebrew with the notion of "praise" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/9-8.htm">Genesis 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>); a term, therefore, of theocratic vaunting (<a href="../../par/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And not sinners of the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); <span class="accented">and not of the Gentiles sinners.</span> The word "sinners" must be here taken, not in that purely moral acceptation in which all are "sinners," but in that mixed sense in which moral disapproval was largely tinged with the bigoted disdain which the theocratic Israelite felt for "the uncircumcised;" the Levitically purist Jew for them who, having no" Law "(<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), wallowed in every kind of ceremonial pollution, "unclean," "dogs" (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/15-27.htm">Matthew 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). As a notion correlative to that of "Jews," the word is used by our Lord himself when he spoke of his being delivered into the hands of "sinners" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>). As correlative to that of persons fit for the society of the righteous and Levitically holy, it is used by Christ and the evangelists in the phrase, "publicans and sinners," in which it is nearly equivalent to "outcasts." So the apostle uses it here. With an ironical <span class="accented">mimesis</span> of the tone of language which a self-righteous legalist loved to employ, he means in effect, "not come from among Gentiles, sinful outcasts." May not the apostle be imagined to have quite lately heard such phrases from the lips of some of those Pharisee-minded Christians to whom Cephas was unhappily now truckling? For the right appreciation of the train of thought which the apostle is now pursuing, it is important to observe that both Cephas and Paul had reason to regard themselves as having been, before they were justified, <span class="accented">sinners</span> in another sense of the deepest dye. St. Paul felt to the very end of his days that he had once been, and that therefore in himself he still was, a chief of sinners (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>); and surely the wickedness into which Cephas precipitated himself on the morning of his Lord's passion must have left ever alter in <span class="accented">his</span> mind too a similar consciousness.

In the present instance it may have been dictated by the reversal of the order of the ideas, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That we might be justified by the faith of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). Renouncing all thought of gaining righteous<span class="accented">ness</span> by (or from) doing works of the Law, we fixed our faith upon Christ, in order to gain righteousness by (or from) believing in him. The form of expression does not determine the time when they expected to become righteous; but the whole complexion of the argument points to their justification following immediately upon their believing in Christ. That full recognition of fellow-believers, which is the hinge on which the discussion turns, presupposes their being already righteous through their faith. <span class="cmt_word">And not by the works of the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is added <span class="accented">ex abundanti</span>, to clench more strongly the affirmation that works of the Law have no effect in making men righteous. <span class="cmt_word">For by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> [or rather, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>). This simply repeats the affirmation in the first clause of the verse, with only an intensified positiveness; the future tense, "shall be justified," expressing, not the time at which the act of justification takes place, but the absoluteness of the rule that no human being is to expect ever to be justified by works of the Law. In <a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a> we have identically the same sentence with the addition of "in his sight." Instead, however, of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, found in that passage, many recent editors here give <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, there being no more difference between <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, than between "because that" and "because." In both passages it looks as if the apostle meant to be understood as citing <span class="accented">a locus probativus</span>; and the addition of the words, "in his sight," in Romans indicates that the authoritative passage referred to is <a href="../../par/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a>, which in the Septuagint reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

This verse, viewed as a statement of the individual experience of the two apostles Peter and Paul themselves, is verified with respect to the latter by the accounts given in the Acts of his conversion. With respect to St. Peter, its verification is supplied to the reflective student of the Gospels by his realizing the process of feeling through which that apostle's mind passed in the several situations thus indicated: "This day thou shalt deny me thrice;" "He went out and wept bitterly;" "Go and tell his disciples and Peter, he goeth before you into Galilee;" "The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon;" "Simon, son of John, lovest thou me?" "They worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy." Further, the highly animated language with which, in their writings, each of these apostles - St. Paul, for instance, in the Romans (5. and 8.) and Ephesians, and St. Peter in several passages of his First Epistle - portrays the peace and exulting joy which Christ's disciples experience through faith in him, is evidently drawn from their own mental history. And this happy experience of theirs was, most palpably, in no degree whatever derived from works of the Law, but solely from the grace of Christ As St. Peter had recently intimated at Jerusalem, their hearts, as truly as the hearts of their fellow-believers of the Gentiles, "God had cleansed" from the sense of guilt and pollutedness before him "by faith" (<a href="../../par/acts/15-9.htm">Acts 15:9</a>). It is necessary here to be quite clear as to the nature of those "works of the Law" which the apostle has now in his view. This is determined by the preceding context. The works of the Law now in question were those, the observance of which characterized a man's "living as do the Jews" and their non-observance a man's "living as do the Gentiles." It was the disregard of these works on the part of the Gentile believers which the Jewish Christians, whom St. Peter would fain stand well with, considered as disqualifying them from free association with themselves. So, again, when St. Peter was "living as do the Gentiles," he was viewed as setting at nought, not the moral precepts of the Law, but its positive ceremonial precepts only. It is the making that distinction between believers living as do the Gentiles and believers living as do the Jews, which Peter and the brethren from James were in effect making, that the apostle here sets himself so sternly to reprobate. It is with this view that he here asserts the principle that through faith in Christ a man is made righteous, and that through faith in Christ only can he be, these works having nothing whatever to do with it.  "You Cephas," he says, "and I were living as do the Jews; no unclean sinners of Gentiles were we! And both you and I have been made righteous. And how? Not through those works of the Law, but through believing in Christ Jesus. And these Gentile brethren, from whom you are now shrinking back as if they were not good enough for us to associate with, - they believe in Christ as truly as we do; they are therefore as truly righteous as we are. It is absurd for you to try to thrust upon them those works of the Law; by the works of the Law can neither they be made righteous nor yet we. So neither, on the other hand, by disregarding the works of the Law can either they or we be made sinners." This last position, that the neglect of the works of the Law does not disqualify a fellow-Christian for brotherly recognition, is plainly essential to his present argument. But this is true only of the neglect of the positive Levitical precepts of the Law; the neglect of its moral precepts does disqualify him (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>). Does it not seem a just inference from this course of argument, that no man whom we have reason to believe to be justified by faith in Christ is to be refused either Christian association or Church fellowship?

At that time they in heart utterly renounced the notion that "works of the Law" had any effect upon a man's standing before God; they saw that his doing them could not make him righteous, as well as that his not doing them would not make him a sinner (see <a href="../../par/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>). This was an essential feature of their state of mind in seeking righteousness in Christ. They distinguished Levitical purity and pollution from spiritual and real. And the principle was not only embraced in their hearts, but, in course of time, it embodied itself also, as occasion served, in outward deed. They, both Paul and Cephas himself, were bold to "live after the manner of Gentiles" (ver. 14), and with Gentiles to freely associate. If this was wrong, it was most heinously wrong; for it would be nothing short of a presumptuous setting at nought of God's own Law by which they flagrantly proved themselves to be, in a fatal and damning sense, <span class="accented">sinners.</span> But it was by the gospel that they had been led to think thus and to act thus; in other words, by Christ himself. Would it not, then, follow that Christ was a minister to them, not of righteousness, but of sin, of damning guilt? The participle "seeking" does not merely mark the time at which they were found to be sinners, but also and indeed much more, the course of conduct by which they proved themselves such. The words, "in Christ," are not equivalent to "through Christ," though the former idea includes the latter; the preposition is used in the same sense as in the sentences, "In God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>); "Of him are ye in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>); "Sanctified in Christ Jesus" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>). It denotes a state of intimate association, union, with Christ, involving justification by necessary consequence. Comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>, "That I may be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ." <span class="cmt_word">We ourselves also are found sinners</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">we ourselves also were found sinners.</span> The word "found" hints a certain measure of surprise (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/1-18.htm">Matthew 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-21.htm">Romans 7:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). Cephas was behaving now as if to his painful surprise he had found himself to have been previously acting m a most guilty manner. The word "sinners" appears to denote more than the state of ceremonial uncleanness incurred by violating the prescriptions of Levitical purity; indeed, it meant more even as used by thorough-going ceremonialists (as in ver. 15); it points to the gross outrage which would in the case supposed have been put upon the majesty of God's Law. In the next verse "transgressor" is used as a convertible term. "Ourselves also" - as truly as any Gentile of them all. There is a touch of sarcasm in the clause, having a covert reference to St. Peter having turned his back upon his Gentile brethren as unfit for him to associate with; he thereby was treating <span class="accented">them</span> as "sinners." <span class="cmt_word">Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fee;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">is Christ a minister of sin</span>? <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is found in the New Testament besides only in <a href="../../par/luke/18-8.htm">Luke 18:8</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/8-30.htm">Acts 8:30</a>, in both which passages it simply propounds a question, without indicating whether the answer is expected to be negative or affirmative.

"Abhorred be the thought!" we both say; but (the apostle means his interlocutor to understand) since it cannot without horrid impiety be said that Christ was a minister to us of sin and not of righteousness, it follows of necessity that we did <span class="accented">not</span> sin against God when we set the works of the Law aside and sought righteousness in Christ alone without any respect had to them. The Greek phrase is one of several renderings which the Septuagint gives to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">chali'lah</span>, <span class="accented">ad profana</span>, which is frequently used interjectionally to relegate some thought to the category of what is utterly abhorrent and polluted. The Hebrew word is discussed fully in Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">in verb.</span> St. Paul uses the Greek phrase twice again in this Epistle (once absolutely, Galatians 3:21, and once inweaved in a sentence, Galatians 6:14); ten times absolutely in his Epistle to the Romans (3, 4, 6, etc.). It occurs also <a href="../../par/luke/20-16.htm">Luke 20:16</a>. It is impossible to mend the vigorous rendering of our Authorized Version.

This word "transgressor" denotes, not one who merely happens to break, perchance inadverdently, some precept of the Law, but one who, perhaps in consequence of even one act of wilful transgression, is to be regarded as trampling upon the authority of the Law altogether (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-9.htm">James 2:9, 11</a>, which are the only places of the New Testament in which the word occurs; it is therefore a full equivalent to the word "sinner" of ver. 17). The Greek verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, "to put forward in a clear light," is used similarly in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>. It is much debated, and is certainly nowise clear, how far down in the chapter the rebuke addressed to St. Peter extends. If it does not reach to the end of the chapter, as some think it does, the break may be very well placed at the end of this verse. For this verse clearly relates to St. Peter, whether actually addressed to him or not; notwithstanding that the verbs are in the hypothetical first person singular, they cannot be taken as referred to St. Paul, not being at all applicable to his case. On the other hand, with the nineteenth verse the first person is plainly used by St. Paul with reference to his own self, which is indeed marked by the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> with which it opens. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I through the Law am dead to the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,); <span class="accented">for I</span>, <span class="accented">for my part</span>, <span class="accented">through the Law died unto the Law.</span> This <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is not the hypothetical "I" of ver. 18, which in fact recites the personality of St. Peter, but is St. Paul himself in his own concrete historical personality. And the pronoun is in a measure antithetical; as if it were: for whatever may be your feeling, mine is this, that I," etc. The conjunction "for" points back to the whole passage (vers. 15-18), which has described the position to which St. Paul had himself been brought and on which he still now, when writing to the Galatians, is standing; he here justifies that description. "Through the Law;" through the Law's own procuring, through what the Law itself did, I was broken off from all connection with the Law. From the words, "I have been crucified with Christ," in the next verse, and from what we read in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, most especially when taken in connection with the occurrences at Antioch which at any rate led to the present utterance, and with the hankering after Judaical ceremonialism in Galatia which occasioned the writing of this letter, we may with confidence draw the conclusion that St. Paul is thinking of the Law in its ceremonial aspect, that is, viewed as determining ceremonial purity and ceremonial pollution. He is here most immediately dealing with the question, whether Jewish believers could freely associate without defilement in God's sight with Gentile believers who according to the Levitical Law were unclean, and could partake of the like food with them. The notion of becoming dead to the Law through the cross of Christ has other aspects besides this, as is evinced by <a href="../../par/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1-6</a>; a fact which is indeed glanced at by the apostle even here; but of the several aspects presented by this one and the same many-faced truth, the one which he here more particularly refers to is that which it bore towards the Law as a ceremonial institute. That which the Law as a ceremonial institute did in relation to Christ was this - it pronounced him as crucified to be in the intensest degree ceremonially accursed and polluting; to be most absolutely <span class="accented">cherem.</span> But Christ in his death and resurrection-life is appointed by God to be the sinner's only and complete salvation. It follows that he who by faith and sacrament is made one with Christ, does, together with the spiritual life which he draws from Christ, partake also in the pollution and accursedness which the Law fastens upon <span class="accented">him</span>; he is by the Law bidden away: he can thenceforth have no connection  with it, - the Law itself will have it so. "But (the apostle's feeling is) the Law may curse on as it will: I have life with God and in God nevertheless." This same aspect of the death of Christ as disconnecting believers from the Law viewed as a ceremonial institute, through the pollutedness which the Law attached to most especially that form of death, is referred to in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-13</a>. The phrase, "I died unto the Law," is similar to that of "being made dead to the Law" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>), and being "discharged [or, 'delivered'] from the Law (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)," which we have <a href="../../par/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4, 6</a>; though the particular aspect of the fact that the cross disconnects believers from the Law is not precisely the same in the two passages, since in the Romans the Law is viewed more in its character as a rule of moral and spiritual life (see <a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might live unto God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">that I might become alive unto God.</span> It is not likely that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is a future indicative, although we have <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in ver. 4, and the form <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>; for the future would most probably have been <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11, 12</a>; and <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>.

The apostle died to the Law, in order that through Christ he might come into that vital union with God in which he might both serve him and find happiness in him; this service to God and joy in God being the "fruit-bearing" in which the "life" is manifested (<a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5, 6</a>).

The perfect tense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> points to a continued state of being, following upon that decisive crisis of his life; the apostle images himself as still hanging on the cross with Christ, while also sharing in his resurrection-life; his "old man" is on the cross, while his spirit partakes in and is renewed by Christ's life in God (<a href="../../par/romans/6-6.htm">Romans 6:6, 8, 11</a>). The <span class="accented">pragmatism</span> of the passage, however, that is, its relevancy to the subject discussed by him with St. Peter, consists in the twofold statement: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Law as a ceremonial institute has now nothing to do with him nor he with it, except as mutually proclaiming their entire disseverment the one from the other; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that nevertheless, while thus wholly apart from the Law, he has life in God, as he further proceeds to declare. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless I live</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). Notwithstanding all the Law's anathema, I am alive unto God (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-11.htm">Romans 6:11</a>), the object of his love, and an heir of his eternal life. With this exalted blessedness of mine the Law cannot in the slightest degree meddle, by any determination which it will fain propound of cleanness or uncleanness. No ceremonial pollution of its constituting can touch this my life. My own life and my fellow-believer's life in God is infinitely removed from the possibility of receiving taint of pollution through eating (say) of blood, or suet, or pork, or through touching a leper or the remains of a deceased man. Nothing of this kind can mar or stain my righteousness or my fellow-believer's righteousness. Both he and I, sharing in the like "life" and righteousness, rejoice and exult together; let the Law denounce us for unclean as loudly and as bitterly as it will. Nay, if I were to allow myself to be disquieted by any such denouncement of pollution, I should, in fact, be allowing myself to harbour misgivings and unbelief touching the very essence of the grace of Jesus Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and yet no longer I</span>, <span class="accented">but Christ liveth in me.</span> It was essential to the apostle's argument that he should assert <span class="accented">himself</span> to be, in spite of the Law's anathema, "alive," in the full possession of life in God; but he hastens to qualify this assertion by explaining how entirely he owes this life of his to Christ; and, in his eagerness to do this, he compresses the assertion and the qualification in one clause so closely together as, in a way not at all unusual  with him, well-nigh to wreck the grammatical construction. A method, indeed, has been proposed by critics of disposing this clause with respect to the preceding in such a manner as to make the sentence run quite smoothly; thus: <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: that is, as given in the margin of the Revised English Version, "I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ liveth in me." But not only does this method of construing altogether efface the apostle's assertion of his being alive notwithstanding the Law's malediction - an assertion which agrees so thoroughly with the defiant tone of the argument, but the abruptness of the construction as presented in the ordinary reading of the passage is its very recommendation; for such uncouthness of style is wont to show itself in St. Paul's more eager, impassioned passages. "No longer I;" as in those old days when I prided myself on being an especial favourite of Heaven, eminently righteous through meritorious doings of my own, through my punctilious observance in particular of all that the Law prescribes for gaining and maintaining ceremonial sanctity (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4, 6</a>). "In <span class="accented">those</span> days it was I that was alive; it is not so now." The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "I was alive," of <a href="../../par/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>, serves again as a perfect illustration of the <span class="accented">phraseology</span> of the present passage; only we have still to bear in mind that the apostle is at present contemplating the ceremonial aspect of his old life, rather than, as in the Romans, the moral; the two being no doubt, however, in his former Pharisee scheme of religion, essentially conjoined. The in-being of Christ is to be understood as blending in one the two notions, of Christ as the ground of our acceptableness before God and of our being alive unto God, and of Christ as the motive spring of true practical well-doing (<a href="../../par/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>). The two things, though notionally distinct, cannot exist apart, but the former is the more prominent idea here<span class="cmt_word">. And the life which I now live in the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>). "Life" still denotes his spiritual state of being, and not his moral activity, though by inference in-relying this latter; as if it were "the life which I now possess." The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;</span> is paralleled by the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>, "the death that he died, he died," and the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1fc7;</span>, "the life that he liveth, he liveth," of <a href="../../par/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>. "Now," as well as "no longer," stands in contrast with his old life in Judaism. But, on the other hand, "in the flesh," viewed in conjunction with (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) "in faith," or "by faith," must be taken as in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-22.htm">Philippians 1:22</a>, that is, as contrasted with the future life; while we are in the flesh "we walk by faith, not by sight" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I live by the faith of the Son of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">I live by faith</span>, the faith <span class="accented">which is in the Son of God.</span> By faith, not by works of the Levitical Law. It was by faith in Christ that I first became partaker of this life; it is by faith in Christ that I continue to partake of it; letting go my faith in Christ, I partake of the life no longer. The especial relevancy of this statement of the apostle's, whether with respect to the matters agitated at Antioch, or with respect to any such revival of Levitical notions of acceptableness with God as was now perplexing the Churchmen of Galatia, is the warning which it implicitly conveys that, to revert to Levitical notions of uncleanness or of righteousness, was to sin against faith in Christ, and therewith against the very essence of a Christian's spiritual life. It was the strong sense which the apostle had of the absolutely fatal tendency of such relapses towards Judaism that inspired the deep pathos which here tinges his language. Hence the magnificent title by which he recites Christ's personality, "the Son of God;" possessing as such an absolutely commanding claim to his people's adherence, which they <span class="accented">dare</span> not decline. Hence, too, the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Who loved me, and gave himself for me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">who loved me</span>, <span class="accented">and gave himself up for me.</span> Fain would the reader realize to his mind the fervid, thrilling tones and accent of voice in which the apostle, while uttering these words, would give vent to the sentiment which so powerfully swayed his whole life, and which he so vividly describes in writing to the Corinthians: "The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died [namely, to all but him]. and he died fur all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>). The same appropriation of Christ's love to his own individual self which the apostle here gives utterance to, "who loved <span class="accented">me</span>, and gave himself up for <span class="accented">me</span>," may every human creature also express in whom only is the faith which takes hold of his love. In fact, the apostle speaks thus for the very purpose of prompting every individual believer who hears him to feel and say the same. This, he indicates, should be <span class="accented">their</span> feeling just as much as his; a sentiment just as irresistibly regulative of their life. Why not? <span class="accented">Do they</span> not also owe to him all their hope on behalf of their souls? For the expression, "gave himself up," comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a> and note. The Greek verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is distinguished from the simple <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "gave  himself," by its bringing more distinctly into view the notion of Christ's giving himself over into the hands of those who sought his life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness <i>come</i> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I do not frustrate the grace of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">I do not reject the grace of God.</span> As I should be doing, it; instead of resting with "glorified" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-8.htm">1 Peter 1:8</a>) satisfaction in the fatherly love and complacency with which God regards me in Christ, I began to give anxious heed to what the Law prescribes touching things or persons clean or unclean, and to deem it possible and needful to secure acceptableness with God through works of ceremonial performance. If it were only for one single reason alone, I do not, I cannot, thus slight and set at nought <span class="accented">the state of grace</span> with all its attendant blessings into which God has in Christ Jesus brought me. The "grace of God" presents that entire notion of the kingdom of grace which the apostle sets forth, and on which he descants with such glowing animation, in the fifth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans. The term of itself stands in vivid contrast to that slavish, anxious, never assured working for acceptance, which characterized the Jewish legalist, and characterizes the legalist Christian as well. As the apostle does not write <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span>, which would mean, "I do not set aside, not I," he is not to be read as if just now emphasizing a <span class="accented">personal</span> contrast between himself, and either St. Peter or the Judaizers with whom St. Peter was then to outward appearance taking sides; he is at present simply winding up his recital of his remonstrance at Antioch with the one terse argument, with which he then justified his own position, and, as if with a sledge-hammer, at once demolished the position of the Judaizers. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;</span> means "reject," "turn from as from a thing unworthy of regard;" as in <a href="../../par/mark/7-9.htm">Mark 7:9</a>, "Ye <span class="accented">reject</span> the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition;" <a href="../../par/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>, "The Pharisees and lawyers <span class="accented">rejected</span> for themselves the counsel of God;" <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>, "He that <span class="accented">rejecteth</span> [our testimony touching this], <span class="accented">rejeeteth</span> not man, but God;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-28.htm">Hebrews 10:28</a>, "A man that <span class="accented">hath set at nought</span> Moses' Law;" in which last passage it indicates, but without itself fully describing, a more aggressive disobedience. The rendering "made void," adopted by the Revisers, in the sense of "disannul," is doubtless fully authenticated by <a href="../../par/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-12.htm">1 Timothy 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-18.htm">Hebrews 9:18</a>. Since even an apostle could not "disannul" the "grace of God" viewed in itself, this sense of the word, if adopted, would, as well as the perhaps questionable rendering of our Authorized Version, "frustrate," apply to the previous work of Divine grace wrought upon the apostle's own soul. But the logical connection of the following clause is more easily shown by our reverting to the sense before given to the verb, which in the New Testament is the more usual one. <span class="cmt_word">For if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for if through the Law is righteousness</span>, <span class="accented">then did Christ for nought die.</span> This one reason is decisive. The sole reason why the Son of God came into the world to suffer death was to do away our sins and make us righteous with God. But if sin can be purged by the purifications of the Law, and cleanness before God is procurable by Levitical ceremonies, <span class="accented">then</span> there was no need for this; <span class="accented">then</span> the Crucifixion, for this one end ordained and from the beginning of time prepared for by the Father, and fur this one end, of his own free choice gone forward to, brought about, and undergone by Christ himself, was a simply superfluous sacrifice. We might have been saved, nay, have perchance saved ourselves, without it. It is impossible to find in all Scripture a more decisive passage than this in proof both of the fact of, the atonement and of its supreme importance in the Christian system. This is emphatically Christ's great work. Compared with this, all besides is either subsidiary or derivative, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, (as a mere gift,) "for nought;" that is, without cause, there being no call or just occasion for it; thus, <a href="../../par/john/15-25.htm">John 15:25</a>, "They hated me <span class="accented">without cause</span>;" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>, Septuagint, "Slay David <span class="accented">without a cause</span>;" <a href="../../par/ezekiel/6-10.htm">Ezekiel 6:10</a>, Septuagint, "I have not said <span class="accented">in vain</span> that I would do this evil unto them;" Ecclus. 29:6, "He hath got him an enemy <span class="accented">without cause."</span> The apostle adds nothing as to the effect of his remonstrance. It is impossible, however, to doubt that, so instinct as it was with the power of the Holy Spirit, it proved successful, not only in the healing of the mischief which had begun to show itself in the Antiochian Church, but also in its effect upon St. Peter. Nothing has transpired of any later intercourse between the two apostles. But the thorough honesty which in the main was one of St. Peter's great characteristics, notwithstanding the perplexed action in which from time to time he got involved, through the warmth of his sympathetic affections and his sometimes too hasty impulsiveness, would be sure to make him pre-eminently tractable to the voice of a true-speaking and holy friend; and, moreover, in the present instance, St. Paul was appealing to sentiments which he had himself recently proved at Jerusalem to be deeply operative in his own bosom. How deeply operative, is further evinced in his own two Epistles, written some eight  or ten years later than this Epistle, and addressed also in part to the same Galatian Churches; in which he not only weaves into his language not a few expressions and turns of thought which have all the appearance of being borrowed from Epistles of St. Paul, but also in the second of them makes direct mention of those Epistles, speaking of them as standing on the footing of "the other Scriptures," and of their author as "our beloved brother Paul;" notwithstanding that one of those very writings contains the extremely plain-spoken account of that sad fall of his at Antioch. which we have here been considering.

We have, therefore, to omit them and to read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> as before <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> is a remarkable word, and calls for comment. In common Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, to treat one with malignant words, means either to slander, belie, blacken character, or to cast upon him primarily words conveying baleful spells, and then, in later usage very frequently, baleful spells of any kind, and more especially spells from the "evil eye" (Aristotle, Plutarch); in the language of old English superstition, "forelook" or "overlook." Indeed, so closely did this last notion cling to the verb, as to have suggested to Greek grammarians for its etymology, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to kill with the eyes." The more scientific etymologists of recent days derive it from <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1ffd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, speak; as if it were "to bespeak a man." The nouns <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, following the senses of the verb, express the ideas, either of envious detraction or of sorcery (see Schneider; Passow; Liddell and Scott). In the New Testament the word occurs only here. In the Septuagint we meet with it in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>, where, for the words, "His eye shall be evil towards his brother," we have <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, meaning apparently, "He shall grudge with his eye his brother;" and so again in ver. 56, the same phrase is used analogously of the tender woman, "She shall grudge with her eye her husband;" Ecclus. 14:6, "There is not a worse man (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) than he that grudges his own self;" ibid. ver. 8, "Evil is (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>) he that grudgeth with his eye. In Scripture, both in the Old Testament and the New, and in the Apocrypha, the phrases, "the eye being evil," "the evil eye," following the Hebrew, always denote envy, ill nature, niggardliness (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54, 56</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a> [comp. <a href="../../par/proverbs/22-9.htm">Proverbs 22:9</a>, "a bountiful eye"]; <a href="../../par/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a>). Nowhere either in the Scriptures or in the Apocrypha is there any reference to "forelooking," unless perchance the <span class="accented">me'onen</span>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a> (Authorized Version, "observer of times"), is etymologically connected with the Hebrew word for "eye," which, however, few critics suppose. Ignatius, 'Ad Romans', 3, has <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "never grudged any man." This Septuagintal use of the verb presents, as the reader will observe, a somewhat different shade of meaning to any of those cited above from the lexicons. Following, however, its guidance, we may  understand the apostle as here asking, "Whoso ill-natured jealousy was it that did light upon you?" and as intending to convey these two ideas: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the envy of their once happy state which actuated the agent referred to; and, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by <span class="accented">implication</span>, the baleful effect wrought by the envier upon them. The aorist of the verb seems to point to a decisive result. He had, it is hinted, succeeded in his wish; he had robbed them of the blessedness which had excited his jealousy. In respect to the former idea, elsewhere (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a>, "They would fain shut you out") the apostle ascribes the action of their misleaders to sinister designs against their well-being. It is, indeed, this thought that inspires the extreme severity of his language above in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>; the <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, of whom he here speaks, belonged to, or derived from, <span class="accented">them.</span> In short, the pathetic question here before us breathes the like indignation and vexation as that in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, "Ye were running on well: who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?" - the last words of which passage, though not admissible here in the text, would, however, if there, form a perfectly correct explanatory clause. The more distinctly to mark the effect actually produced by the envier, very many commentators have enwoven into their interpretation of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, besides its Septuagiutal sense, its other sense of blasting with some kind of charm: "The malignity," Chrysostom writes, "of a demon whose spirit [or, 'breath'] had blasted their prosperous estate." Great use has been made, in particular, by many, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Jerome and, according to Estius, by Thomas Aquinas, of the superstition of the "evil eye," which, in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, has in all ages been so rife. Bishop Lightfoot, in his interesting note on the passage, offers the following paraphrase: "Christ's death in vain? O ye senseless Gauls, what bewitchment is this? I placarded Christ crucified before your eyes. Ye suffered them to wander from this gracious proclamation of your King. They rested on the withering eye of the sorcerer. They yielded to the fascination and were riveted there. And the life of your souls has been drained out of you by that envious gaze." It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle would have recognized his own thought in this thorough-going application of the superstition of the "evil eye." It is doubtful whether he used the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> with reference to any species of sorcery at all; but if he did, he may have intended no more than this: "What envious ill-wisher has by some strange, inexplicable sorcery so wrought upon you? Or, how can I explain your behaviour, except that you have been acting under some binding spell? Surely such folly is well-nigh inconceivable with men in free possession of their own souls." But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> each of these two renderings of the passage is open to the objection that St. Paul, in writing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, either might have intended to express by the word "envious grudging," according to its Sep-tuagintal use, or he might have meant some kind of sorcery according to a common acceptation of the term, but could hardly have meant to convey both senses together. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The introduction of the supposition is inconvenient, not only because there could not have really been any such ingredient in the actual circumstances of the present case, but also because its mention would serve to excuse the folly of the Galatians, as indeed Chrysostom observes that it does, rather than to enhance its censure, which latter would have been more to the apostle's purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It seems especially improbable that the apostle was thinking of the "evil eye" when we consider the entire absence of its mention in the sacred writings. <span class="cmt_word">Before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>;); <span class="accented">to whom</span>, <span class="accented">before your very eyes</span>, <span class="accented">Jesus Christ had been</span> (literally, <span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented">aforetime</span> (or, <span class="accented">openly</span>) <span class="accented">set forth crucified</span> (<span class="accented">among you</span>)? The genuineness of the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "among you," is very doubtful. The Revised Greek text omits them. The words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "before your very eyes," are very pointed; for the Greek expression, comp. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>), and Aristoph., 'Ran.,' 625, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x1fc3;</span>, "that he may say it to your very face." The sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> is much disputed. It is not clear whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is the "before" of time or of place. Of the other passages in the New Testament in which this compound verb occurs, in <a href="../../par/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a> twice, and <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> is certainly, and in <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> probably, not so certainly (comp. 1 Macc. 10:36, "enrolled"), "before" of time. In the present passage a reference to the prophecies of the Old Testament seems out of place. It is far more suitable to the connection to suppose that the apostle is referring to his own preaching. Some commentators, retaining the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, connect them with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span> in the sense of "in you," comparing "Christ in you" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>), and "written in your hearts" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>); and so render the words thus: "written of, or described, before in you." But such an expression, sufficiently awkward in itself, would further be very unsuitably introduced after the words, "before your very eyes." Supposing we take the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> as of time, there is no satisfactory explanation of the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;</span>, if understood in the sense of <span class="cmt_word"></span> writing, there being no tablet (so to speak) suggested on which the writing could be conceived of as done. <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span>, it is true, means "describe" in <a href="../../par/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; but it is still a description in writing. We are, therefore, driven to assign to the verb the notion of portraying as in a painting, a sense which in Common Greek it certainly does sometimes bear, and which attaches to it in the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> of <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-10.htm">Ezekiel 8:10</a> (Septuagint). We thus gain the sense, "had before been set forth or por trayed;" before (that is) the envier assailed you. This same sense, of portraying rather than of writing, would be also the best to give to the verb, supposing the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> to be understood as the "before" of place; which conception of the preposition Bishop Lightfoot contends for, urging the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and the nouns <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, with reference to the placards on which public notices were given of political or other matters of business. When, how ever, we consider how partial the apostle is to verbs compounded with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> of time, as is seen in his use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span>, not a few of which were probably compounded by himself as he wanted them, it appears highly probable that, to serve the present occasion, he here forms the compound <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "portraying before," the compound not existing elsewhere in the same sense. He compares, then, the idea of Christ crucified, presented to his hearers in his preaching, to a portraiture, in which the Redeemer had been so vividly and with such striking effect exhibited to his converts, that it ought in all reason have for ever safeguarded their souls against all danger from teaching of an alien character. If the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, be retained, it appears best, with Chrysostom and many others, to understand it as meaning, that St. Paul had presented Christ crucified in such lively colours to their view, that they had, <span class="accented">as it were</span>, seen him hanging on the cross in their very midst. The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, disconnected from <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> and at the end of the sen tence, gives it intense significance. What the idea of Christ crucified was to his own self, the apostle had just before declared; for him it at once had destroyed all spiritual connection with the ceremonial Law, the Law which bade the crucified One away from itself as accursed, and also by the infinite love to himself which he beheld manifested in Christ crucified <span class="accented">for him</span>, had bound him to him by spiritual ties both all-constrain ing and iudissoluble. And such (he means) should have been the effect produced by that idea upon <span class="accented">their</span> souls. What envier of their happiness in him could, then, possibly have torn them from him? This same portraiture of "Christ crucified" which he reminds the Galatians he had in those days presented to them, he also, as he tells the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20, 21</a>), had been intent on holding up before the Greeks of Achaia; while, further, he intimates to the Romans, in his Epistle to them, how eager he was to come and at Rome also hold up Christ as him whom God had set forth to be a Propitiation, through faith, by his blood (<a href="../../par/romans/1-15.htm">Romans 1:15, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25</a>). Both to the Jew and to the Gentile, both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to unwise, this, emphatically <span class="accented">this</span>, was the alone and the sovereign salvation. This picturing forth of the crucified One, however, would hardly from Paul's lips concern itself much with the outward particulars of the passion; it might have been this, in a far greater degree, in St. Peter's presentment of it, who had been himself witness of those sufferings; but Paul, with his habits of thought, as we know them from his writings, who knew Christ as in the spirit rather than as in the flesh, would occupy himself more with the spiritual <span class="accented">idea</span> of the cross - its embodiment of perfect meekness and gentleness and self-sacrifice, of humility. of obedience to the Father's will, of love to all mankind, of especial care for his own, and its antagonism to the spirit of Levitical ceremonialism. "Such presentment," remarks Calvin, "as if in a picture, nay, as if actually crucified in the very midst of the hearers themselves, no eloquence, no artifice of rhetoric, can produce, unless that mighty working of the Spirit be assistant of which the apostle speaks in his two Epistles to the Corinthians (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-4.htm">1 Corinthians 2:4, 5, 13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3, 6</a>). If any, therefore, would fain duly discharge the ministry of the gospel, let them learn not so much to apply eloquence and declamation, as to likewise so pierce into men's consciences that these may truly <span class="accented">feet</span> Christ crucified and the dropping upon them of his blood. Where the Church hath painters such as these, she very little needeth any more representations in wood and stone, that is, dead images, very little any paintings; and certainly among Christians the doors of the temples were not open for the reception of images and paintings until the shepherds either had grown dumb and become mere dolls, or else did say in the pulpit no more than just a few words, and these in so cold and perfunctory a manner that the power and efficacy of the gospel ministry was utterly extinct."

You remember that time. Well, how was it then? Had there a word been then spoken touching meats or drinks, or washings of purification (besides your baptism into Christ), or circumcision, or care of ceremonial cleanness? Had you attended to any one point whatever of Levitical ordinance? Had either you or I cast one thought in that direction? The "works of the Law" here referred to must still be works of <span class="accented">ceremonial</span> performance, not those of moral obedience; for repentance, the practical breaking off from sin, the surrender of the soul to God and to Christ in faith and loyal obedience, the outward assuming of the character of God's servants, the purpose and inchoate performance of works meet for repentance, - these dotings of compliance with the <span class="accented">moral</span> Law <span class="accented">were</span> there.

The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;</span> denotes sometimes (what is heard) "report," "rumour," as <a href="../../par/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>; sometimes, especially in the plural, the organs or sense of hearing, as <a href="../../par/mark/7-35.htm">Mark 7:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-1.htm">Luke 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-20.htm">Acts 17:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-11.htm">Hebrews 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3, 4</a>; sometimes the act of hearing, as <a href="../../par/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> (Septuagint).

"Were you not at once received into the kingdom of God and filled with joy in the Holy Spirit, immediately upon your believing acceptance of the gospel message?" With exquisite propriety, as Bengel observes, is hereby marked the nature of faith, not working, but receiving. This agrees also best with the illustration which in ver. 6 the apostle gives of the phrase as introduced by him again in ver. 5.

In respect to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, the leading of the context in which the verse is embedded might incline us to take the verb in the sense in which it frequently occurs in Greek writers, that of being subjects of such and such treatment, good as well as bad; as, for example, in Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:15, 1, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "What treatment having received from him [<span class="accented">sc</span>. God], and what huge benefits having partaken of" - the character of the treatment being sufficiently indicated by the context as being that of kindness. But it is a fatal objection to this view of the passage that, in the forty passages or more in which the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;</span> is used in the New Testament, it never is used of good treatment, but always of bad; and so also always in the Septuagint. We are, therefore, shut up to the sense of "suffering ills," and must endeavour to find, if we can, some circumstances marking the troubles referred to which might serve to explain the seemingly abrupt mention of them here. And the probable explanation is this: those sufferings were brought upon the Galatian converts, not only through the influence of Jews, but also in consequence of the bitter enmity with which the Jews regarded St. Paul, as bringing converts over from among the Gentiles to the service of the one true God apart from any regard to the ceremonial Law of Moses. That Jews in general did thus regard St. Paul is shown by the suspicion which even Christian Jews felt towards him (<a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>). For this no doubt, it was that the Jews in Asia Minor persecuted him from city to city as they did, their animosity against him extending itself also to these who had attached themselves to him as his disciples. That it did extend itself to his disciples as such appears, as from the nature of the case, so also from <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>, "That through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God;" as also it is evinced by the strongly indignant tone in which he speaks of the persecuting Jews in his two Epistles to the Thessalonians, written near the very time to which he here alludes (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8, 9</a>) - this indignation being best accounted for by the supposition that it was roused by his sympathy with the similarly originated sufferings of the Macedonian brethren to whom he was writing. That the troubles here referred to emanated from the hostility of Jewish legalists may be further gathered from <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12</a> (on which see Exposition). Those Jewish legalists hated both St. Paul and his converts, because they alike walked in "the Spirit," that is, in the element of Christian spirituality emancipated from the bondage of the Law, and not in "the flesh" of Mosaic ceremonialism. Hence it is that the mention in ver. 3 of the Galatian brethren having "begun with the Spirit," leads him on to the thought of the sufferings which just on that very account had been brought upon them. "For nought." This adverb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;</span> sometimes means, prospectively, "to no good," as in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-11.htm">Galatians 4:11</a>, "bestowed labour upon you <span class="accented">in vain</span>," and probably in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>; sometimes, retrospectively, "for no just cause," as in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>, "vainly puffed up." The English phrase, "for nought," has just a similar ambiguity. The apostle may, therefore, mean either this - Did ye suffer all these troubles to reap after all no benefit from your suffering them, forfeiting as you do (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>) the reward which you might else have expected from the great Retributor (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:6, 7</a>) through your forsaking that ground of faith on which ye then stood, if indeed ye have forsaken it? or this - Did ye provoke all that persecution without just cause? - if, indeed, there was no just cause as ye seem now to think. According to the former view, the Galatians were now nullifying the benefit which might have accrued to them from their former endurance of persecution; according to the latter, they were now stultifying their former conduct in provoking these persecutions. The first seems somewhat the easiest. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>. The concluding clause has been here regarded as a reaching forth of the apostle's soul towards the hope that better thoughts might yet prevail with the Galatian waverers, so that they would not lose the reward of having suffered for Christ - a hope which he thus glances at, if so be he might thus lure them to its realization. But another view of the words has commended itself to not a few eminent critics, namely, that the apostle glances at the darker prospect; as if he had said, "If it be, indeed, merely for nought, and not for far worse than that! By falling away from the gospel, ye not only lose the crown of confessorship: ye forfeit also your hope of your heavenly inheritance" (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>). The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is, confessedly, sometimes almost equivalent to "merely," "only," as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in Homer, 'Odyssey,' 1:58, <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "Longing if only but to see the smoke leaping upward from his native land." But in the present case <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span> does not so readily suggest the last proposed suppletion of thought as it does the other.  
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, <i>doeth he it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); he <span class="accented">then that sup-plieth to you the Spirit and worketh powers in you</span>, or, <span class="accented">miracles among you.</span> The "then" marks the taking up afresh of the topic brought forward in ver. 2, with especial prominence given here to the miraculous manifestations of the Spirit's presence. The argumentative treatment of this topic of the gift of the Spirit was interrupted in vers. 3 and 4 by curt, strongly emotional interrogatories, darted forth upon the apostle's recollecting the animated spirituality which marked those early days of their discipleship. The impassioned desultoriness of his language here, together with its abrupt, niggardly wording, is paralleled by <a href="../../par/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10-20</a>. Perhaps these features in the form of the composition were in part occasioned by the circumstance that he was writing this Epistle with his own hand and not through an amanuensis; such manual exertion being, it should seem, unusual with him, and from some cause even laborious and painful: and so from time to time he appears, as it were, laying down the pen, to rest, to quell emotion, to reflect. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, supply, differs probably from the simple form <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> only by indicating profusion in the supply; but this qualification of its meaning is too slight to be representable in translation. Besides <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5, 11</a>, we find it in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-10.htm">2 Corinthians 9:10</a>, "He that supplieth (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) seed...  shall supply (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and multiply your seed for sowing;" <a href="../../par/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>, "From whom all the body...  being supplied;" <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>, "As of the strength which God sup-plieth." And with similar application the substantive "supply" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) in <a href="../../par/philippians/1-19.htm">Philippians 1:19</a>, "Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;" <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-16.htm">Ephesians 4:16</a>, "Through every joint of the supply." These passages make it clear that "he that supplieth" is no other than God. And this conclusion is borne out by the comparing of the other clause, "<span class="accented">worketh</span> powers in you," with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-6.htm">1 Corinthians 12:6</a>, "It is the same God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> who worketh all in all" (referring to the charismata) - which passage shows that "<span class="accented">powers</span>' (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) are not "<span class="accented">miracles"</span> themselves as in <a href="../../par/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a> and Matthew 11:20, and often, but power to work miracles, the plural number pointing to the various forms of its manifestation, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>.

With the sparingness of words above noted, the apostle barely jots down, so to speak, the <span class="accented">substance</span> of the interrogative dilemma, without filling in the <span class="accented">form</span> of the question. The suppletion would naturally be that of our version, "doeth he it." The substance of the argument apparently required no more than, as before, the question - Was it in consequence of works of the Law or of the hearing of faith that the Spirit and his wonder-working powers were received? But instead of putting it so, St. Paul interposes the personality of the great God himself as imparting these great gifts, making his sentence thereby the more stately and impressive: it is with God in the might of his working that these corrupters of the gospel have to reckon. The impartation of the Spirit and the charisms evidenced God's complacency in the recipients. On what was that complacency founded? on their earning it by ceremonial performances, or on their simply opening their hearts to receive his love? It was a question which the Galatian Churchmen might, if they would, see the answer to in experiences of their own. Among themselves these powers had appeared, and no doubt were still operative. "Well, then," says the apostle, "look and see: are they not operative in those only of you who had received them upon the mere acceptance of righteousness offered them through faith in Christ simply, without having given any heed to Mosaic ceremonialism? Have any of you received them after taking up with such ceremonialism?" The apostle, it will be observed - and the remark is one of no small importance - makes an appeal to simple matters of fact, founded upon his and their own familiar acquaintance with the facts, and defying contradiction. We may be sure, therefore, that the facts were as he indicates, however small the extent may be to which we, with our imperfect knowledge of the circumstances, are ourselves able to verify his statement. In some degree, however, we can. Besides the striking illustration afforded by what occurred in the house of Cornelius (<a href="../../par/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>), we see that such charismata were bestowed, and in some instances, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> at Corinth, in exceeding great profusion, in the train of St. Paul's evangelizing ministrations; and how remote those ministrations were from the inculcation, or even the admission, among Gentile converts of Mosaic ceremonialism we know perfectly.

This, he now adds, was in exact conformity with what was recorded of Abraham; as soon as Abraham heard the promise made to him, "So shall thy seed be," he believed it, and by the hearing of faith was justified. The mutual correspondence of the two cases lay in this, that in imparting to those believers the Holy Spirit, God showed that they were in his favour, were justified people, simply because of their faith; even as Abraham was shown to be in his favour, having likewise by faith been justified. The apostle weaves into his sentence the very words of <a href="../../par/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>, as they appear in the Septuagint, with scarcely any modification; the Septuagint reading thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. But in doing so he both himself feels, and will have his readers feel, that they are words of <span class="accented">Scripture</span> from which, as such, reliable conclusions might be drawn, as is shown by the next verse. In the Hebrew, however, the passage runs as in our Authorized Version, "He believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him for righteousness." The words are quoted with substantially the like agreement with the Septuagint and divergence from the Hebrew also in <a href="../../par/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>, and by St. James in his Epistle (<a href="../../par/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>) (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;</span>, etc.). "It was reckoned;" in the Hebrew, "he reckoned it;" "it," that is, his believing: God regarded it as imparting to him perfect acceptableness, his sins no longer disqualifying him for being an object of the Divine favour. It is of the greatest importance to take note what the kind of faith was which God reckoned to him for righteousness. It was not simply a persuasion that what God says must be true. As Calvin remarks, Cain might have a hundred times exercised faith in what God had said to him, without thereby receiving righteousness from God. The reason why Abraham was justified by believing was this: a promise had been given him by God of his fatherly goodness towards him; and this word of God's he embraced as certainty. The faith, therefore, which the apostle is thinking of is the faith which has respect to some word of God which is of such a sort that reliance upon it will enable a man to repose in God's love to him for time and for eternity. The reference to Abraham's case which St. Paul makes in such very brief terms he expands in the fourth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans to a considerable length, ending with these words: "Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was reckoned to him [for righteousness]; but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was delivered up for our offences, and was raised for our justification." Christ's death and resurrection are God's word and guarantee to the whole human race, assuring us of his forgiveness and of his offer to us of eternal life. If we hear this word with faith, committing ourselves to his love, God on that ground at once justifies also us. It is evident that, in the apostle's view, the word "righteousness," as used in the recited passage of Genesis, does not mean "a righteous act," - that is, that Abraham's believing God's promise was viewed by Heaven with approval; but complete acceptableness investing Abraham himself. In consideration of that exercise of faith God accounted him a righteous man. The Greek phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>, "was reckoned for righteousness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reckoned as being righteousness, is similar to <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, "reckoned as nought" (<a href="../../par/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "reckoned for circumcision" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "reckoned for a seed" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>). Are we to lifter from these two verses, 5 and 6, that in the apostle's view all who received spiritual gifts were thereby proved to be, or to have been, justified persons and in enjoyment of the Divine favour? We can hardly think this. The phenomena disclosed to us in the two Epistles addressed to the Corinthians. as to the moral and spiritual behaviour of some at least of their body, tend to show that individuals possessed of charisms were found in some instances to make a very vainglorious use of them, and needed to be reminded that the thaumaturgic gifts were of a fleeting character and of incomparably less value than qualities of moral goodness. Certainly Christ himself has told us that "many" will at the last be found to have been possessed of such miraculous gifts, whom nevertheless he "never knew." One of the very apostles was a Judas. Perhaps the solution is this: companies of men were dealt with in the diffusion of these gifts according as they were characterized, viewed each as a whole, though there might be individuals in each company imperfectly, very superficially, some perhaps not at all, animated by the sentiment generally prevailing in the body. If a community as a whole was pervaded extensively by a spirit of frank acceptance of the gospel doctrine and of pious devotion, its members brought by baptism into the "body which is Christ," the Holy Spirit made such a community his habitation (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>;  <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-16.htm">2 Corinthians 6:16</a>), and diffused his gifts among its members diversely and to all appearance Indiscriminately (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>); at all events not in such wise discriminately as that degrees of personal holiness and acceptableness before God could at all be estimated as standing in proportion to the outward brilliancy of thaumaturgie gifts severally possessed.

The categorical imperative seems of the two the more suited to the apostle's impetuous temperament. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, like the Latin <span class="accented">nosco</span>, properly denotes "to come to know," "learn," "perceive," "get apprised;" <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, like now, having more properly the sense of "knowing."

In both cases the absence of the article before <span class="accented">viol</span> suggests the feeling that the apostle is simply stating a predicate of the class before defined, but not now affirming that this predicate is confined to that class, although, again in each case, he knew that it was so confined. Just here, what he is concerned to affirm is that the possession of faith is a complete and sufficient qualification for sonship to Abraham. There is, perhaps, a polemical reference to the teaching of certain in Galatia, that, to be sons of Abraham or interested in God's covenant with his people, it behoved men to be circumcised and to observe the ceremonial Law. This error would be satisfactorily met by the affirmation of the present verse, that the being believers, simply this, constitutes men <span class="accented">sons</span> of Abraham. In the tenth verse the apostle goes further, aggressively denying to those who "were of the works of the Law" the possession at all of Abrahamic privilege. The class, "men of <span class="accented">faith</span>," did in fact include Jewish believers as well as Gentile; but just hero, as seems probable from what is said in the next verse, the apostle has in view Gentile believers only. The writer's thoughts are hovering round that promise of God ("So shall thy seed be") which had been on that particular occasion the object of Abraham's faith. That this was the case we may infer from his citation of the words in <a href="../../par/romans/4-18.htm">Romans 4:18</a>, the explanation of which had been prepared for by him in what he has said before in ver. 16, "To the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the Law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all." It was this that led him to speak of being sons of Abraham. This train of thought is pursued further in the next two verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, <i>saying</i>, In thee shall all nations be blessed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - The substance of this verse, taken in conjunction with the next, is this: The announcement which the Scripture records as made to Abraham, that "in him all the nations should be blessed," that is, that by being like him in faith all nations should be blessed like him, did thus early preach to Abraham that which is the great cardinal truth of the gospel preached now: it proceeded upon a foresight of the fact now coming to pass, that by faith simply God would justify the Gentiles. <span class="accented">As</span> well as the Scripture quoted before from <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, so this announcement also ascertains to us the position that they that are of faith, and they alone, are blessed with the believing patriarch.

The word "Scripture" in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-20.htm">2 Peter 1:20</a>, "no prophecy of Scripture," certainly denotes the sacred writings as taken collectively, that is, what is frequently recited by the plural, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, "the Scriptures." So probably in <a href="../../par/acts/8-22.htm">Acts 8:22</a>, "the passage of Scripture." We are, therefore, war, anted in supposing it possible, and being possible it is here also probable, that this is the sense in which the apostle now uses the term as well as in ver. 22, rather than as denoting, either the one particular passage cited or the particular book out of which it is taken. This view better suits the personification under which the Old Testament is here presented. This personification groups with that in <a href="../../par/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>, "The Scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up." In both  cases the "Scripture" is put in place of the announcement which Scripture records as having been made, the Scripture itself being written after the time of both Abraham and Pharaoh, and not addressed to them. But here there is the additional feature, of foresight being attributed to Scripture - a foresight, net exactly of the Holy Spirit inspiring the Scripture, but of the Divine Being who, on the occasion referred to, was holding communication with Abraham; although, yet again, "the Scripture" seems in the words, "foreseeing that God would justify," etc., distinguished from "God." The sense, however, is clear; Scripture shows that, as early as the time of Abraham, a Divine intimation was given that God would, on the ground of faith simply, justify any human being throughout the world that should believe in him as Abraham did. Rabbinical scholars tell us that in those writings a citation from Scripture is frequently introduced with the words, "What sees the Scripture?" or, "What sees he [or, 'it']?" <span class="cmt_word">That God would justify the heathen through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">that by</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">out of</span>) <span class="accented">faith would God justify the nations.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> betokens that the apostle's point here is, not that God would justify the Gentiles, but that it was by faith that he would do so irrespectively of any fulfilment on their part of ceremonial observances. The tense of the present indicative <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span> is hardly to be explained thus: would justify as we now see he is doing.

The condition of mankind in the meanwhile is described in vers. 22, 23 - shut up unto the faith that was to be revealed. A question arises as to the exact interpretation of the word <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> as twice occurring in this verse. Does the apostle use it as the correlative to Jews, "Gentiles;" or without any such sense of contradistinction, "nations" including both Jews and Gentiles? In answer, we observe: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The great point in these verses (6-9) is, not the call of the Gentiles, but the efficacy of faith without Levitical ceremonialism, as summed up in the words of ver. 9. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The original passage which the apostle is now referring to is that in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where the Septuagint, conformably with the Hebrew, has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: in our Authorized Version," And in thee shall all families [Hebrew, <span class="accented">mishpechoth</span>] of the earth be blessed:" only, through some cause or other, instead of "all families," he writes the words, "all nations" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), which we find in what was said by the Lord to the two angels (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>), <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> [that is, Abraham] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>: Authorized Version, "all the nations of the earth" (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>, and the promise to Isaac, <a href="../../par/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>, are irrelevant to the point now under consideration). We, therefore, are warranted in assuming that, as <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="accented">might</span> be used as coextensive with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("families"), it really <span class="accented">is</span> here employed by the apostle with the same extension of application. We may add that, most certainly, the apostle utterly repudiated the notion that God justifies Gentiles on a different footing from that on which he justifies Jews: whether Jews or Gentiles, they only who are of faith are blessed with Abraham; and, whether Jews or Gentiles all who are of faith <span class="accented">are</span> blessed with him. <span class="cmt_word">Preached before the gospel unto Abraham</span>, saying (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham</span>, <span class="accented">saying.</span> Very striking and animated is the apostle's use of this word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, a compound verb, minted no doubt for the occasion out of his own ardent thought, though it is found also in his senior contemporary, Philo. It is plainly an allusion to the "gospel" now openly proclaimed to the world as having been "by anticipation" already then announced to Abraham, the Most High himself the herald; signifying also the joy which it brought to the patriarch, and (Chrysostom adds) his great desire for its accomplishment. Tim blessed and glorious gospel of the grace of God has been the thought of God in all ages. May we connect with this the mysterious passage in <a href="../../par/john/8.htm">John 8</a>:567 In point of construction, the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is nowhere else followed by <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>: but as it is sometimes found governing an accusative of the matter preached (<a href="../../par/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-42.htm">Acts 5:42</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>), there is no harshness in its construction with <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which we may here represent in English by "saying." <span class="cmt_word">In thee shall all nations</span> <span class="cmt_word">be blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>). "In thee" as their type and pattern, in respect both to the "blessing" bestowed upon him and to the faith out of which his blessing sprang. The "blessing" consists of God's love and all the well-being which can flow from God's love; the form of well-being varying according to the believer's circumstances, whether in this life or in the life   to come; it receives its consummation with the final utterance, "Come, ye blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Into this condition of blessedness the sinful and guilty can only be brought through justification; but justification through Christ does of necessary consequence bring us into it. The compound form of the verb, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;</span>, added to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, forcibly indicates that moral inherency in Abraham, through our being in faith and obedience his spiritual offspring, whereby alone the blessing is attained and possessed. Chrysostom remarks, "If, then, those were Abraham's sons, not who were related to him by blood, but who follow his faith, for this is the meaning of the words, 'In thee all nations,' it is plain that the Gentiles are brought into kindred with him." Augustine explains "in thee," similarly: "To wit, by imitation of his faith by which he was justified even before the sacrament of circumcision." Luther writes "In Abraham are we blessed, but in what Abraham? The believing Abraham, to wit; because if we are not in Abraham, we are under a curse rather, even if we were in Abraham according to the flesh." Calvin likewise: "These words beyond all doubt mean that all must become objects of blessing after Abraham's fashion; for he is the common pattern, nay rather, rule. But he by faith obtained blessing; therefore faith is for all the means."

The apostle gathers from the words cited in ver. 8 the two particulars, that there are who get to be blessed like Abraham and with him, and that it is by faith like Abraham's, without works of the Law, that they do so. He seems to have an eye to the sense of Divine benediction which the Galatians had themselves experienced, when upon their simply believing in Christ the Spirit's gifts had been poured forth upon them. The word "faithful" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) is inserted, <span class="accented">ex abundanti</span> almost, to mark the more explicitly and emphatically, the condition on which both Abraham and therefore others in him gain the blessing. This being "in Abraham," which is here predicated of all who gain justification and God's benediction, is analogous to the image of Gentiles, being by faith "grafted," and by faith abiding, in the "olive tree," which we have in <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17, 20</a>. The verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is generally passive, "one to be believed <span class="accented">or</span> trusted in," and so a man "of fidelity;" but it is also at times active, in the sense of "one who believes," as <a href="../../par/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-15.htm">2 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-1.htm">Ephesians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-10.htm">1 Timothy 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-16.htm">1 Timothy 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a> (so in <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/john/20-27.htm">John 20:27</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>).

The apostle is now making the clause in the preceding verse, "they who are of faith," the <span class="accented">limiting</span> description of those who "are blessed with faithful Abraham;" - I say, they who are of faith; for they who are of the works of the Law are in a very different case. In the phrase, "are of the works of the Law," the preposition "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) has the same force as has been already noted in the phrase (ver. 9), "they who are of faith;" it signifies dependence upon, belonging to, taking position from; and it marks a moral posture of mind voluntarily assumed. The apostle in laying down the aphorism of the present passage has doubtless an eye to those of the Galatians who were moving for the adoption of circumcision and the ceremonies of the Levitical Law. Withdrawing from the category of those who were of faith, they were preparing to join those who were of the works of the Law. If their taking up with circumcision, and with these or those of the Levitical ordinances, was not mere childish trifling; if in serious and solemn earnest it meant anything, it meant this - that they looked to gain from these observances acceptableness before God, as performing works commanded by his Law given through Moses; but in that view they were bound to take the Law in its entirety, and do <span class="accented">every</span> work which it prescribed, ceremonial and moral alike; for all of it came invested with the like authority and as a part of that institution was alike binding (see <a href="../../par/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>). Let them now consider well how in such circumstances their case would stand. That the "works of the Law" which stand foremost before the apostle's view in the present discussion are those of a ceremonial character is apparent from the tenor both of vers. 12-19 of the preceding chapter and of vers. 1-10 of the next. There is, indeed, generally tiffs difference observable between the phase of the Law regarded in this Epistle, as compared with that which engages the apostle's thoughts when writing to the Romans: in the Romans the prominent notion of the spiritual condition of those under the Law is that they are in a state of guiltiness, condemnation, spiritual inability, unconquered sin; while in the Galatians the prominent notion of their condition is that  they are in a state of slavery, <span class="accented">that</span> the dispensation they are under is spiritually an enslaving one, a yoke of bondage (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1-3, 9, 24, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1, 13</a>). In the Romans the moral aspect of the Law is mostly in view; in this Epistle its ceremonial aspect. The consideration of these distinctive features marking this Epistle will perhaps prepare us the more readily to apprehend the particular shade of meaning with which the apostle uses the words, "are under cursing." He means, not precisely that a curse has already been definitely pronounced upon them so that they now stand there condemned, but that the <span class="accented">threatening</span> of a curse is always sounding in their ears, filling them with uneasiness, with constant apprehension that they shall themselves fall under it. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> is thus used for malediction, cursing, in <a href="../../par/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9, 10</a>, "Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men;...  out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>);" <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-13.htm">Deuteronomy 27:13</a> (Septuagint), "These shall stand (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) for the cursing upon Mount Ebal" - that is, for the denouncement of the several curses with which they were to threaten different classes of transgressors. As many, says the apostle, as are of the works of the Law are under a black cloud of malediction, which is ready to flash forth in lightning wrath upon every failure in obedience. And what man of them all can hope not to merit that inexorable lighting down of judgment? Supposing them to be ever so exact and punctual in their observance of those ordinances of the flesh which certain of those Galatian Churchmen are hankering after, how will it fare with them in respect to those other weightier precepts of the Law which require spiritual obedience? For one single example, how will they be able to render unfailing obedience to the commandment, Thou shalt not covet? Beyond question, the apostle writes with the sense which he has so fully developed in his Epistle to the Romans (<a href="../../par/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7-24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), that no one under the economy of the Law ever did, or ever could, continue in all things which were written in the Law to do them; and that therefore they that forsook the gospel of Christ to look to the Law for acceptance with God would beyond doubt become, nay, taken as they were at any moment had already become, each individual, the specific object of malediction, a child of cursing, a child of wrath (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>). Nevertheless, his purpose just here may be presumed to be, not to affirm this, but rather to point to the miserable state of apprehensiveness and fear of instant wrath which they who were of the works of the Law must needs be in bondage to. Most commentators, however, understand <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning, not "cursing" or uttering general sentences of cursing (<span class="accented">maledictio</span>), but "a curse" (<span class="accented">maledictum</span>), that is, a specific curse incurred already by each individual in consequence of his having of a certainty already sinned against some commandment of the Law; if not against some ceremonial commandment, at any rate against some moral precept. Whichever way we understand it, such (the apostle at all events means) was the condition into which those Judaizing Gentile converts were preparing to precipitate themselves. For it is written, <span class="cmt_word">Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the book of the Law to do them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> without <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, which conjunction is according to the Greek usage introduced superfluously] <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>). The Septuagint (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>) has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> [this <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> of doubtful genuineness] <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span> [or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew is correctly given in the Authorized Version, "Cursed <span class="accented">be</span> he that confirmeth not <span class="accented">all</span> the words of this Law to do them." The apostle, quoting the Septuagint apparently from memory, gives the general sense rather than the exact words. He that sins against a commandment, as (to use the Septuagint phrase) he does not "continue in" it, but departs from it, so also, he, as far as his action reaches, sets it aside or abrogates it instead of "confirming" it. The word "all," not found in our present Hebrew text, is stated by critics to be in the Samaritan as well as in the Septuagint. This is the last of the twelve several maledictions pronounced from Mount Ebal, and certainly includes in its scope the ceremonial as well as the moral precepts of the Law. But what did this malediction import? Certainly it expressed abhorrence - the Divine Author of the Law, and his ministers and people accepting, pronouncing, and ratifying the denunciation, all join in repudiating the offender, casting him out from among them with loathing: so much is clear. What practical effect was to be given to the malediction, even by men in this life, not to speak of the action of God hereafter in the life to come, is nowhere indicated; but all could see thus much - the offender, if dying unreconciled, would depart hence accursed of both man and God. The notion of guiltiness before God and accursedness incurred by transgression of merely ceremonial precepts has been so greatly effaced from men's consciousness by the teaching, direct and  indirect, of Christ's gospel, that we find it hard to realize to our minds that there ever existed a posture of the spirit answering to such a notion, or. if such did exist, that it could be other than the fruit of an uninstructed, ill-trained state of the conscience. But it was not this, so long as the economy of Moses was in force. For these positive laws were laws of God, binding during his pleasure upon the conscience of every Israelite; and in proportion as an Israelite's consciousness of the existence of Jehovah and of his own covenant relation to Jehovah was real and vivid, in that proportion would he be careful, scrupulously careful even, in obeying those positive laws. He had, indeed, to duly estimate the comparative importance and obligation of positive and of moral precepts, especially when in actual practice they came into conflict, according to the principle laid down for example in <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; but it was at his peril that he at any time neglected the former, though still less might he dare to neglect the latter. For every Israelite, as long as the Law continued in force, that which was said by Christ was strictly true, and in both clauses meant to be taken in solemn earnest, "These latter ought he to do, and not to leave the other undone" (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>). It was, for instance, a matter of conscience for the truly conscientious Israelite to carefully purify himself from pollution incurred by contact with the dead, and to abstain from swine's flesh; he might not neglect such purifications or partake of such meat without breaking a commandment of God's, without therefore incurring God's displeasure; and it behoved him to feel that he could not, and in proportion to the sincerity and depth of his religious sentiment he did feel it. Now, even when Israelites lived in a world of their own, comparatively free from the presence of Gentiles, the observance of the Levitical Law must needs have been at times felt to be an irksome or even anxious obligation; but its irksomeness and anxiety must have been greatly increased when Gentiles were not merely brought into close contact with them, but were even their masters. St. Peter confessed how burdensome it was felt to be, when he pronounced it a yoke which neither they nor their fathers had been able to bear. The feeling of relief must therefore have been inexpressibly great when an Israelite could come to be assured that those positive laws had ceased to be obligatory; that even if from habit or from national or social sentiment he continued to observe them, yet his conscience was quite free to disregard them without fear of displeasing God; that God's covenanted mercy had no longer any reference whatever to such observances, and that he might worship him acceptably, and hold joyful communion with him (say) in the Lord's Supper, though he had just before been handling a corpse without being since purified, or eating "unclean" meats, or working on the sabbath day. This relief the gospel brought; God's servants learnt with joy that they were righteous and accepted before him simply through faith in Christ without those "works of the Law." The curse was reversed. <span class="accented">Now</span> it ran thus: "Anathema be he who doth not wholly trust in Christ crucified for righteousness! Anathema be he who brings dead ordinances of the Law to darken his brethren's joy!"

The apostle, assuming that every one is guilty and under a curse, now shows that the Law offers no means of justification. "But." The apostle is meeting the notion that, though one who is of works of the Law is evermore threatened with a curse ready to light down upon him, and though the curse has been, as it cannot but have been, actually incurred, yet, by setting himself afresh to the endeavour and thenceforward continuing steadfast in all things written in the Law, he may thus win pardon and righteousness with God. To obviate this conception, without stopping to insist upon the fact that through indwelling sin no man possibly can continue in all the things written in the Law, he puts the notion aside by stating that this is not the method of justification which Scripture recognizes. This he shows by adducing that cardinal aphorism of Habakkuk, by which, as it should seem, the apostle was wont to substantiate the doctrine of justification by faith (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>). The way in which the passage is here introduced, almost as an <span class="accented">obiter dictum</span>, and as if not needing a formal indication of its coming out of Scripture, suggests the feeling that the passage, as taken in the sense in which the apostle reads it, was one already familiar to his readers, no doubt through his own former teaching. When in the Acts (<a href="../../par/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39-41</a>) we read that in the synagogue at the Pisidian Antioch, in close connection with the statement that through believing in Christ a man is justified, he cited another passage of Habakkuk (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>), denouncing unbelieving despisers, we cannot doubt that he had made good his statement about justification by alleging this same probative text. "In the Law;" that is, as being it. the sphere and domain of the Law. Compare  the use of the same preposition: <a href="../../par/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, "As many as have sinned under [Greek, 'in'] the Law;" 3:19, "It saith to them that are under [Greek, 'in'] the Law." An exactly parallel construction is found in <a href="../../par/acts/13-39.htm">Acts 13:39</a>, "From all things from which ye could not by [Greek, 'in'] the Law be justified." They could not as being in the Law find therein any means of gaining acceptance. "Is justified with God;" comes to be accounted righteous with him. "With God;" not merely outwardly, Levitically, in the judgment of a Levitical priest - but inwardly and in reality, in God's estimation. The preposition "with" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) is used similarly in <a href="../../par/romans/2-13.htm">Romans 2:13</a>, "For not the hearers of the Law are righteous with God;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-19.htm">1 Corinthians 3:19</a>, "The wisdom of this world is foolishness with God." It is God himself that justifies the sinner (<a href="../../par/romans/3-30.htm">Romans 3:30</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>); but the apostle does not write "is justified by God," because he is confronting the notion so natural to man, and above all, to the Judaizing legalist, that a man is to make himself righteous by doings  - ceremonial or moral - of his own. <span class="cmt_word">For, The just shall live by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">the righteous by faith shall live.</span> The apostle is not weaving the prophet's words into his own sentence simply as aptly expressing his own thought, but is citing them probatively as words of Scripture; as if he had said, "As Scripture saith, The righteous," etc. The same is the case with the words introduced in the next verse out of Leviticus; so <a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7</a>. In <a href="../../par/romans/15-3.htm">Romans 15:3</a> and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a> the apostle inserts, "according as it is written," as in parenthesis, before adding the words of Scripture in such a way as to form a continuation of his own sentence. "The righteous by faith shall live;" that is, the righteous man shall draw his life from his faith. It is generally agreed upon by Hebrew scholars that in the original passage (<a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>) the words, "by his faith" (or possibly, adopting another reading of the Hebrew text, "by my faith," that is, by faith in me) belong to "shall live," rather than to "the righteous" (see on this point Delitzsch on <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>, and Canon Cook on <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary'). And that St. Paul so understood it is made probable by the contrasted citation of" shall live in them "in the next verse. With this conjunction of the words, the passage suits the apostle's purpose perfect]y; for if it is by or from his faith that the righteous man lives, then it is by or from his faith that he gets to be accepted by God as righteous. The "faith" spoken of is shown by the context in Habakkuk to mean such reliance upon God as is of a steadfast character, and not a mere fleeting or occasional acceptance of God's promises as true. This is plainly the view of the passage which is taken by the Pauline writer of the Hebrews in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>.

This is closely connected with the latter part of the preceding verse, as forming another portion of the proof which is there introduced by "for." Ver. 11 should end with a semicolon, not with a full stop. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> at the beginning of this verse is slightly adversative, setting "the Law" in contrast with the notion of "living by or from faith." These words, "by or from faith" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), are borrowed from the preceding citation. We may paraphrase thus: The Law does not put forward as its characteristic principle, "by faith;" the characteristic principle of the Law is rather that which we read in the third book of Moses (Leviticus 18:5)," The man who hath actually done them shall live by them." <span class="cmt_word">But, The man that doeth them shall live in them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>: (the word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is omitted by the recent editors, as having crept into the text from the Septuagint); <span class="accented">but</span>, <span class="accented">He that doeth them shall live in them.</span> The whole verse (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-5.htm">Leviticus 18:5</a>) in the Authorized Version, following the Hebrew, stands thus: "And ye shall keep my statutes and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord." The Septuagint runs thus: "And ye shall keep [or, 'and keep ye'] all my statutes and all my judgments, and ye shall do them [or, 'and do ye them']: the man that doeth them shall live in them (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) I am the Lord your God." It thus appears that the pronoun "them" recites "my statutes and my judgments." But this the apostle is not at present particularly concerned to specify; his main point here is that the Law requires such and such things to be actually <span class="accented">done</span>, before it holds out the prospect of life to be gained thereby. Those under the Law were bound to render strict obedience to all its requirements, whether moral or ceremonial; and whosoever set aside any of whichever class was constituted by the Law a "transgressor" and a man "accursed." As it stands in the passage of Leviticus referred to, the clause which is cited bears not so much the aspect of a promise as of a restrictive statement implying a threatening or warning, and is therefore its harmony with the commination quoted in ver. 10. The "doing" here spoken of differs essentially from evangelical obedience. Comprising as it did its very large proportion the observance of the ceremonial prescriptions (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Law, it points to a course of conduct in which a man, striving to earn pardon and  acceptance by a meritorious life, had continually to be turning his eye, slavishly and under fear of the "curse" in case of failure, towards an external Law, whose detail of positive enactments, in addition to the regulation of his moral conduct and inward spirit, he was bound with scrupulous exactness to copy in his life. The spiritual obedience of "faith," on the other hand, evolves itself (in the apostle's view) freely and spontaneously from the inward teaching and prompting of God's Spirit, of which it is the natural product or "fruit" (ch. Galatians 5:22). Such are these two forms of religious life when <span class="accented">viewed each in its idea.</span> When, however, we compare the spiritual state of many even sincere believers in Christ, so far as we can estimate it, with the spiritual state of (say) the marvellous author of <a href="../../par/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a>. or of David and other pious Israelites, as disclosed in the exercises of pious feeling garnered in that same devotional book, we cannot fail to perceive that an Israelite under the Law might yet be not "of the works of the Law," but in no small degree qualified to teach the Christian believer himself, even in the life which is "of faith." "Shall live in them;" that is, shall find in them a fountain, as it were, of life. The Targums, Bishop Lightfoot observes, define the meaning of "living" by "life eternal."

"Redeemed," or "bought us off." The same compound Greek verb occurs <a href="../../par/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>, "That he might redeem [buy off] them who were under the Law;" obviously, buy off from being under it. Another Greek verb, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, ransom, is rendered "redeem" in <a href="../../par/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>; whence the compound verbal noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, redemption, in <a href="../../par/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>, etc. The apostle may be supposed to have preferred to use <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> here, as pointing more definitely to the price which the Redeemer paid; for in <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, redeem, this notion of a price paid often lies so far in the background as to leave the verb to denote simply "deliver." The un-compounded verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, buy, is found with reference to Christ's death in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a> and 1 Cor 7:23, "Ye were bought with a price;" <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, "The Master that bought them;" <a href="../../par/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>, "Didst purchase unto God with thy blood." In the present passage it is not the blood of Christ, as in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18</a>, that is regarded as the purchase money, - for the notion of expiation with blood of sacrifice is not even glanced at; but rather, as the next words show, his taking upon him the accursedness and pollution which by the Law attached to every one crucified. "From the curse of the Law;" its cursing affects us no more. God's people are, in Christ. no longer, as they were before, subject to his disapproval or abhorrence, in consequence of transgressing the positive, ceremonial enactments of the Law of Moses. In respect to that class of transgressions, its cursing expended itself, and perished, upon the crucified body of the Son of God. <span class="cmt_word">Being made a curse for us</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fc0;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">having become on our behalf a curse.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> makes it emphatic. The form of expression, "become a curse," instead of "become accursed," is chosen to mark the intense degree in which the Law's curse fastened upon the Lord Jesus. Compare the expression, "made him on our behalf sin," in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. Probably the form of expression was suggested to the apostle by that found in the Hebrew of the passage of Deuteronomy which he proceeds to cite (see next note but one). The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;</span>, "for,...  . on behalf of," may possibly mean "in place of," as (perhaps) in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-13.htm">Philemon 1:13</a>; but this idea would have been more distinctly expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>: and the strict notion of substitution is not necessary to the line of argument here pursued. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>).

The Hebrew is <span class="accented">qillath elohim talui</span>, "a curse of God is he that is hanged." The words, "every one" and "on a tree," are additions made by the Septuagint; the latter expression, however, is found in the preceding clause, as also in the preceding verse; so that the sense is given rightly. The apostle departs from the Septuagintal rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "a curse of God," probably because he regarded the rendering as inaccurate;  for the phrase, "curse of God," is probably a strongly intensive form of expression, like "wrestlings of God," in <a href="../../par/genesis/30-8.htm">Genesis 30:8</a> ("great wrestlings," Authorized Version). See note on "exceeding great city" (Hebrew, "a city great unto God") in <a href="../../par/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3</a>, in 'Speaker's Commentary.' According to this view, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, in which the element <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is intensive, is a just interpretation; while it also makes the clause more striking as an antithesis to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., in ver. 10. We are, per haps, justified in adding that it would not have exactly suited the apostle's purpose to admit the words," by God;" for, though the Law pronounced the crucified Jesus a "curse," God, in the apostle's feeling, did not in this case ratify the Law's malediction. To understand the bearing of the verse rightly it is necessary to be quite clear as to the sense in which Christ is here said to have become a curse. The context shows that he became a curse simply by hanging upon a tree. No spiritual trans action, such as that of our guilt being laid upon him, comes into view here at all. It was simply the suspension upon a cross that imparted to him, in the eye of the Law, this character of accursedness, of extreme abhorrent defilement. In other words, the accursedness was the extreme of ceremonial pollutedness - ceremonial, with no admixture of guilt or spiritual pollution. It has, indeed, been attempted by critics, Jewish as well as Christian, as Bishop Lightfoot has shown, to justify this aphorism of the Law, by the plea that one thus punished might inferentially be supposed to have merited this form of execution by some especial enormity of guilt. But, plainly, such previous guiltiness might <span class="accented">not</span> have been present; the man crucified, or impaled, or hung might have suffered upon a false accusation. But though he bad suffered unjustly, his being gibbeted would, notwithstanding his innocence, constitute him "a curse of God" all the same. Ceremonial pollutedness, as well as ceremonial purity, was altogether independent of moral considerations. And at present the line of thought which the apostle is following relates simply to questions of Levitical or ceremonial purity or defilement. Have Christian believers as such anything to do with these matters? This is the point at issue. The apostle proves that they have nothing to do with them, upon the ground that the crucifixion of Christ did away wholly with the ceremonial Law. It will only confuse the reader if he supposes that the apostle means here to embody the whole doctrine of Christ's sacrificial atonement; he is at present concerned with stating the relation which his passion bore to the Law. The passage before us illustrates the meaning of the words in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>, "I <span class="accented">through the Law</span> died unto the Law:" he felt himself disconnected from the ceremonial Law, in consequence of that Law pronouncing Christ crucified "a curse of God." A question arises, how far the crucifixion of Christ, viewed in this particular aspect of its constituting him in the eye of the ceremonial Law an accursed thing, modified for those who believe on him the effect of the malediction which the Law pronounced upon such as violated its moral precepts. The following observations are offered for the reader's consideration. The Law given in the Pentateuch is uniformly spoken of in Scripture as forming one whole. Composed of precepts, some moral, some ceremonial, some partaking mixedly of both qualities, it constituted, however, one entire coherent system. If a part of it was destroyed, the whole Law as such itself perished. If so, then the cross of Christ, by annihilating its ceremonial enactments, shattered in pieces the whole legislation, so that the disciples of Christ are no longer <span class="accented">at all</span> under its dominion, or subjects jurisprudentially (so to speak) to its coercive punitive power. Yet its moral precepts, so far as they embodied the eternal principles of rectitude, would, so far, and because they do so, and not because they were part of the Law given through Moses, continue to express the will of God concerning us. Being, however, "letter" and not "spirit," they were always altogether inadequate expressions of that Divine will - a will which is spiritual, 'which is evermore changing its form and aspect towards each human soul, according to the ever-varying conditions of its spiritual position. The moral precepts of the Law are for us no more than types or figures, mere hints or suggestions of the spiritual duties which they refer to; they cannot be regarded as definitively regulative laws at all. Thus they appear to be treated by Christ and his apostles; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21-37</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8-10</a>; and it is in this light that the Church of England regards them, in reciting the Decalogue in her Pre-Communion Office. And, analogously, the curse which the Law pronounces upon those who set any of its precepts at nought, whether moral or ceremonial, may be regarded as a mere type, revealing, or rather giving a slightest most imperfect glimpse of, the wrath with which the Divine justice burns against wilful transgressors of the eternal Law; a hint or suggestion, again, and not its direct denouncement. God's people, however, by being through faith united to the crucified and risen Christ, become through his cross dead to the whole Law of Hoses, both as regulative and as punitive, - freed from it absolutely; not,  however, to be without Law unto God; only, the Law they are now under is a spiritual Law, one conformable to the nature of that dispensation of life and of the Spirit, to which through the Risen One they belong. With this view it agrees that the execration which the Law pronounced upon the Son of God as crucified, and by pronouncing which the Law itself perished, is to be regarded as a most significant and impressive symbol of the <span class="accented">spiritual</span> import of our Lord's death. It pronounces to the universe that, for those who by faith are one with Christ, the wrath of Divine justice against them as sinners is quenched - quenched in the infinite, Divine love and righteousness of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/3-14.htm">Galatians 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Two results are here stated as having flowed from the abrogation of the Mosaic Law which was effected by the crucifixion of Jesus: one, the participation of Gentiles in "Abraham's blessing," to which they could not have been admitted as long as the Law was authorized to shut them out from God's covenant as unclean; the other, the impartation to God's people, upon their faith only, apart from acts of ceremonial obedience, of the promised gift of the Holy Spirit. Are these stated as <span class="accented">co-ordinate</span> results, in the same way as a repeated <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> ("in order that") introduces co-ordinate results in <a href="../../par/romans/7-13.htm">Romans 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19, 20</a>? Or is the second a consequence of the first? In favour of the first view, it may be said that, in point of fact, Gentiles, as such, were not admitted into a participation in Abraham's blessing till some time after the day of Pentecost. But on the other hand, it may be urged <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that, though not as yet actually admitted, yet in the Divine purpose, and in the ordering of the conditions of the case, they might have come in, - the door was open, though the threshold not actually crossed; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that their admissibility may be supposed to have been in the Divine counsels the prerequisite condition of the Holy Spirit being imparted, it not being fitting that the Spirit should be given so long as the Law was, so to speak, standing there, authorized to debar from this, the most essential portion of "Abraham's blessing," any who were partakers of Abraham's blessing. In the three passages referred to as favouring the construing of the two clauses as co-ordinate, we have not as here two different results, but one and the same, only in the second clause more fully described. The second view seems, therefore, the more probable one. <span class="cmt_word">That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: so most recent editors read, in place of <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>); <span class="accented">that upon</span> "<span class="accented">the nations"</span> <span class="accented">might crone the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus.</span> The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>...   <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, is illustrated by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, "arrive at," or "accrue to," in <a href="../../par/acts/21-17.htm">Acts 21:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/25-15.htm">Acts 25:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-2.htm">Revelation 16:2</a>.

By <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as the whole context shows, the apostle means in particular "the Gentiles," the non-Jews, as such. At the same time, the <span class="accented">phrase</span> is evidently used, as found ready at hand in the passage cited by him in ver. 8, "In thee shall all the nations (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) be blessed," which passage also suggested the notion of "the blessing of Abraham." It had therein been foretold that all the nations should, by exercising the faith of Abraham, obtain the same blessing; and (says the apostle) we see now by what method the benefit has been brought to them. "In Christ Jesus;" not merely <span class="accented">by</span> him; the blessing is, so to speak, immanent in Christ. both procured by him and obtained by the nations through their coming by faith into union with him.

"The blessing of Abraham." The expression, being drawn from the passages in Genesis in which the Lord assures Abraham that "he would bless him," and that "in him all nations should be blessed," must be taken to import the Divine good will and whatever benefits would therefrom result. Men arrive at t is "benediction" by being justified; but justification is only the entrance into it, and not the whole blessing itself. It is styled <span class="accented">Abraham's</span> blessing, as having been emphatically declared to have been possessed by the patriarch, "the father" of all who should thereafter receive it<span class="cmt_word">. That we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>). The pronoun "we" points, not to the Israelites as such, nor to Israelite believers in particular, but to those who were viewed as God's covenant people. These had hitherto been Abraham's natural seed only; and had also hitherto been under the Law. But the time had come when they were to receive the full "adoption of sons," and therewith the Spirit of God's Son (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5, 6</a>); which, however, could not come to pass until the Law, "the yoke of slavery," had been cleared out of the way, opening the gate to God's benediction to all believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. The Law and the Spirit could not coexist. Where the Law had sway, <span class="accented">there</span> was tutor-ship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) and slavery. Such, it is true, was needed, so long as the Spirit was  not there; for moral beings, forming a people of God's, must be under <span class="accented">some</span> Law; and, if there was not a law written on the "fleshy tables of the heart" by God's Spirit, there behoved to be one embodied in an outward code of ordinances, which should coerce men's frowardness and keep them under discipline. But when this outward code had been taken out of the way," nailed to Christ's cross," then the people of God could not be left without the Spirit - the Spirit of holiness, as well as, or rather, because also, the Spirit of adoption; which accordingly was forthwith imparted, the sole condition of the bestowment being their living obedient faith, felt and by baptism professed, in Christ and in God. Comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13-18</a>, as containing a full presentment of these facts relative to the introduction of the new covenant, and in the same order of sequence. Thus the apostle has triumphantly returned to the thesis from which he had started in the two first verses of the chapter - Christ crucified, and the receiving of the Spirit without works of the Law. "The promise of the Spirit" is the Spirit which had been promised; the word "promise" here denoting, not as in <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-33.htm">Hebrews 11:33</a>, the word assuring a subsequent bestowment, but as in <a href="../../par/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-39.htm">Hebrews 11:39</a>, the bestowment itself. The apostle points not merely to such passages of the Old Testament as had definitely fore-announced the outpouring of God's Spirit (Joel 2:38; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>; and the like), but the whole "kingdom of God," or "world to come," whose blessedness therewith came.

"Brethren." The tone of indignant reproach with which the chapter opened has gradually subsided in the course of the apostle's argument; so that here he appeals to the Galatian Churchmen as "brethren; ' as if to bespeak their candid attention to the consideration he is about to allege. "I speak after the manner of men." I say it as stating a principle commonly recognized in human life, in respect to contracts between man and man (see note on the phrase, <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a>). In a similar manner, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16, 17</a> the writer refers to human methods of ratifying solemn engagements, in order to illustrate a course of proceeding on another occasion condescendingly adopted by God<span class="cmt_word">.

The Authorized Version has thus happily rendered the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, which is here transposed cut of its logical position, as it is also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-7.htm">1 Corinthians 14:7</a>, and as <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is in <a href="../../par/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>. The apostle's meaning is <span class="accented">that</span>, if even men are constrained by their sense of justice to abide by this rule, much more may the All-righteous One be expected to do so. This <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> suggestion (for St. Paul only hints this consideration by introducing the word <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> without explicitly developing it) is similar to the <span class="accented">afortiori</span> argument more explicitly stated by our Lord with reference to God's justice, in <a href="../../par/luke/18-6.htm">Luke 18:6, 7</a>; and to his fatherliness, in <a href="../../par/luke/11-13.htm">Luke 11:13</a>. "Covenant." The word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, properly "disposition," which, in classical Greek, generally means "will," "testament," is used in the Septuagint to render the Hebrew <span class="accented">berith</span>, covenant, in which sense it occurs once in Aristophanes, 'Ayes,' 439; and it appears to denote "covenant" in all the thirty-three places in which it is found in the New Testament; for even <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-17.htm">Hebrews 9:17</a> can hardly be allowed to be an exception. Bishop Lightfoot observes that the Septuagint translators and the New Testament writers probably preferred <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, the ordinary Greek word for "covenant," when speaking of a Divine dispensation, because, like "promise," it better expresses the free grace of God. Perhaps the terms appeared to them more suitable also in this application, because one of the parties to the engagement was no other than the supreme sovereign Disposer of all things. "Confirmed;" ratified; as it were, signed, sealed, and delivered. "No one;" meaning neither of the two covenanting parties. "Addeth thereto;" addeth any fresh condition, such as would clog the action of the previous engagement. The apostle adds this with reference to the supposition that the Law of Moses might have qualified the Abrahamic covenant by limiting its benefits to persons ceremonially clean.

Of course, God is himself one of the two parties. This the apostle assumes without specific mention in this verse, though he refers to it in the next. On the other side, he discerns "Abraham <span class="accented">and his seed</span>;" for the form of the sentence, we feel, lays emphatic stress upon the latter copartner. He has in view, apparently, in part, the promise recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>, "All the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever;" perhaps in part the vision related in <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>, wherein (ver. 18) "the Lord  made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land," etc.; but most particularly, since on this occasion circumcision was appointed as the "sign of the covenant," the words in <a href="../../par/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7, 8</a>, "I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee: and I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God." In the present connection the reference is not so obvious to the important promise in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17, 18</a>, on which such stress is laid in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>. These passages, in their primary and plain obvious sense, point to a covenant established by the Lord between himself on the one hand, and Abraham and Abraham's natural seed on the other; ratified on the persons of Abraham and his offspring by the seal of circumcision, and collating to them the gift of the laud of Canaan. But the apostle teaches us to read these passages mystically: in place of Abraham's natural seed substituting "Christ," a spiritual seed; and in place of the land of Canaan substituting a spiritual inheritance. For "covenant," to which term the apostle reverts in the next verse, we have here "promises;" thus also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a>, Abraham is described as "he that had the promises." <span class="cmt_word">He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The use of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, as meaning "of," not found elsewhere in the New Testament, occurs repeatedly in Plato (see Ellicott and Alford, and Winer's 'Gram.,' 47, g). With "many" and "one," we are, of course, to supply "seeds" and "seed." It has been questioned whether such a form of expression as "to thy seeds" would have been possible in the Hebrew. Certainly we do not in the Hebrew Bible find a plural of the noun <span class="accented">zera</span> when used for "offspring," but only when used for a grain of seed. But still, such a plural may not have been unknown to St. Paul in the Hebrew spoken in his time; for it occurs, De Wette tells us, in the Chaldee Paraphrast for "races" in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-14.htm">Joshua 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/10-18.htm">Genesis 10:18</a>. Such a grammatical cavil to his observation, however, the apostle might well have brushed aside by giving his objector to understand that it was not upon a nicety of lingual criticism that he was taking his stand, but upon a fact which was not to be called in question; namely, that of the many branches of descendants owning Abraham as their progenitor, there was only one contemplated by the Almighty as destined to inherit the promise. This principle of discrimination among several lines of descendants he has himself drawn marked attention to in <a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7, 8</a>, by quoting the words, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," and adding the gloss, "That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed." And so here. Among Abraham's descendants one particular head of a race was beforehand selected in the counsels of God, whose issue alone should inherit. As the principle of discriminative predestination was applied with respect to the inheriting of the promises viewed in their secular meaning, so also was it applied with respect to the inheriting of them spiritually: to only one branch of Abraham's descendants did the Divine Disposer guarantee the promised grant; <span class="accented">that</span> which should originate from Abraham's great Descendant, Christ, and which was to be in him and by his name to be called. Which is Christ (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); that is, which seed is Christ; the gender of the relative pronoun, which logically, as reciting a neuter noun, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, should be neuter, being according to a very common usage of the language made masculine by the attraction of the predicate <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The word "seed" still retains its signification of a collective noun, and does not even here denote a single descendant - a sense which usage would not justify us in assigning to it; for even in <a href="../../par/genesis/4-25.htm">Genesis 4:25</a> <span class="accented">zera</span> <span class="accented">acher</span> means "other offspring," and not "another offspring." The word "Christ" is itself employed by the apostle as a collective, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>, "Christ is divided!" or, "Is Christ divided?" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>, "As the body is one, and hath many members...  . so also is Christ." It is usual in the Hebrew idiom to apply to a people the very name, unmodified, of the head from which they derive; as "Israel," "Jacob," "Ephraim," "Judah," and a large multitude of instances. It is certain from vers. 27-29 that St. Paul has in view those who are "in Christ" as being in and with him the "seed" to whom the "inheritance" was by that covenant given. Jesus, viewed in his own solitary personality, has no place in the apostle's present argument: <span class="accented">he</span> it was not that was to inherit the blessing, save only with, or rather in, that multitude of human beings for whose sake he is there at all. Perhaps it is on that account that his official title "Christ" is alone named, in preference to "Jesus" his appellation as an individual man. Having thus ascertained as definitely as we may what it is that the apostle here states, we are naturally led to consider on what grounds he is justified in  affixing to the passage or passages of the Old Testament which he refers to, the sense that he does; both as to the import of the gift which the covenant guaranteed to Abraham's seed and as to the specific seed itself as being" Christ." The answer to such questioning is, for us, at once in a great measure determined by our belief in the claims which St. Paul makes to be regarded as an inspired teacher. With this belief, we do not wait first to ascertain that his exposition is warranted by linguistic or historical reasoning before we will give it our assent. We accept his exposition as one imparted to himself by heavenly teaching, and as the result of inspired spiritual insight gazing into the oracles of God. We refuse to regard it, as some would fain persuade us to do, as mere <span class="accented">midrash</span> of unscientific rabbinism. Perhaps, indeed, rabbinism itself in its better schools - and in such St. Paul had himself in his earlier years been trained - was often far more profound and scientific in its scriptural exegesis than many who have not been conversant with Jewish commentators are disposed to imagine. His exposition is, therefore, not at once and of course condemned, because, if indeed it be the fact, its <span class="accented">method</span> seems to bear upon it the brand of being rabbinical. Thus much is clear - its <span class="accented">substance</span> was beyond all question <span class="accented">not</span> drawn from rabbinism, but learnt from higher teaching. If at first it arouses in our minds a feeling of surprise, and even a degree of hesitation in accepting it as it lies there before us, we may have good grounds for suspecting that this is owing, not to our superior wisdom, but to the superficiality of the views which we are in the habit of taking of the histories and utterances found in the Old Testament. Fuller and clearer insight into the depths of inspired teaching will perhaps enable us by-and-by to grasp with a firmer hold than now the veritable reasonableness and certainty of this apostolic word, and to discern its coherency with other portions of revealed truth. Meanwhile it may conciliate our judgment to a more unfaltering acceptance at once of what we here read, if we will consider how transcendently great is the glory of the personage whose Name is here attached to Abraham's spiritual seed, and how transcendent too is the corresponding glory of that economy of benediction which that august Being has brought in. The infinite grandeur of "God manifest in the flesh" imparts its magnificence both to the community which he graciously takes into union with him, and to the "kingdom of God" which through him they inherit. The glory of Christ fills the whole Church, which, resplendent therewith, eclipses into utter obscurity all other communities heretofore promised to be recipient of Divine blessing: those, feeble types of her, fade away at her coming, their glory and very being absorbed in hers. We need, then, not hesitate to believe that she with her Lord was from the beginning contemplated by the Almighty in the revelations of future benediction which he accorded to men, certainly with a view ultimately to this crowning dispensation; and that anterior dispensations of benediction were symbolically predictive of this.

"And I say this;" that is," And what I have to say is this." As God had already before made a solemn covenant with Abraham and his seed, the Law given so long after cannot have been intended to do away with it; fundamental principles of even human civil equity disallow of any such procedure. "Confirmed before." If the confirmation or ratification is to be distinguished as additional to the solemn announcement, we may find it either in the "seal" of circumcision (<a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>), or in the oath "with which God interposed" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>) after the sacrifice of Isaac.

If genuine, they would seem intended to emphasize that position of "Christ" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in effect his Church) as future copartner with Abraham, which has been already affirmed in the preceding verse. <span class="cmt_word">The Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> [Receptus reads <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, instead of here, with no difference to the sense] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">the Law</span>, <span class="accented">having come into existence four hundred and thirty years after.</span> This number of years the apostle finds in <a href="../../par/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40, 41</a>. In the Hebrew text of that passage this term of four hundred and thirty years defines the stay of the Israelites" in Egypt." But in the Septuagint, as well as in the Samaritan text, the term defines the sojourn of the Israelites ("themselves and their fathers" is, according to Tischendorf, added in the Alexandrian manuscript) "in the laud of Egypt and in the land of Canaan." With the view presented by this Septuagintal version agrees a definite statement of Josephus ('Ant.,' 2:15, 2), "They left Egypt...   four hundred and thirty years after our forefather Abraham came into Canaan, but two hundred and fifteen years only after Jacob removed into Egypt." In two other passages, however ('Ant.,' 2:09, 1;  'Bell. Jud.,' 5:09, 4), Josephus speaks of the affliction in Egypt as lasting "four hundred years;" probably following in this computation the period mentioned in the Divine communication recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13</a>, and cited by St. Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-6.htm">Acts 7:6</a>) in his defence. It is unnecessary here to attempt to determine the chronological question, which is one not free from difficulty. Our readers are referred to some valuable observations of Canon Cook's, in his note on Exodus 12:40; who on apparently strong grounds considers that a longer period than two hundred and fifteen years must be allowed for the sojourn in Egypt (see, however, Mr. Reginald S. Peele's article, "Chronology," in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' vol. 1. pp. 321,322). If the Hebrew text of <a href="../../par/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a> as we have it is correct, and if the Septuagintal version of it errs in including the sojourn of the patriarchs <span class="accented">in Canoan</span> in the there mentioned period of four hundred and thirty years, then the number of years which the apostle here specifies, counting apparently from Abraham's arrival in Canaan when he received the first of the promises cited above in the note on ver. 16, is less than he would have been justified in stating by the interval between Abraham's arrival in Canaan and Jacob's going down into Egypt. But, however, even if the apostle's mind adverted to this particular point at all, which may or may not have been the case, it plainly would not have been worth his while to surprise and perplex his readers by specifying a number of years different from that which they found in the Greek Bible, which both he and they were accustomed to use, even though the greater number would have in a slight degree added to the force of his argument. <span class="cmt_word">Cannot dis-annul</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); <span class="accented">doth not disannul.</span> The present tense is used, because the apostle is describing the present position. <span class="cmt_word">That it should make the promise of none effect</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The "covenant" is here to a certain degree distinguished from "the promise." The latter, being the fundamental and characteristic portion of the former, is brought prominently forward, for the purpose of illustrating the character of the Christian economy as being above all things one of grace and gratuitous bestowment. The feeling also, perhaps, underlies the words that with one of generous spirit - and who so large-hearted and munificent as God? - in proportion as a promise which he has given is large and spontaneous, and the expectation raised by it eager and joyous, in that proportion is it impossible for him to baulk the promisee of his hope. The "promise" was "To thee and to thy seed will I give this land;" the "<span class="accented">covenant</span>," that Jehovah would be their God, and that they should recognize him as such.

The Law says, "The man that doeth these things shall live by them;" and this while enforcing a great variety of minute positive principles by severe threats and penalties. The promise bestows of free grace without works. The promised bestowment is here styled "inheritance," because received by Abraham's seed as his heirs (see ver. 29 and <a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a>). In the Old Testament it is a favourite designation of the land of Canaan; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>.

The perfect tense points to the now and evermore enduring effect of the promise. The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is emphatic - God, no less than he! (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>). The march of this sentence, with which the apostle closes up this paragraph of the discussion, gives, as it stands in the Greek, the reader to feel the apostle's soul dilating with wonder cud delight as he gives expression to the two notions - the gracious freeness of the gift, and the Divine personality of the Giver. The mention here of Abraham alone, without "his seed," is perhaps due to the apostle's sense of the long priority of this guaranteed bestowment to the giving of the Law. In appreciating the tone of the passage, we must not lose sight of the venerableness of this personage, the primordial father, not only of the Hebrew race, but of all believers in Christ to the end of the world.

Here it intimates that the Law was given from a regard to men's sinful actions, with an implied contrast with the covenant of Christ's gospel, which was concerned with men's justification and benediction. The province of the Law is to expose sins, rebuke them, pronounce God's curse upon them, coerce and restrain them by the discipline of a system of outward rites and ceremonies. The office of the Law, as dealing with sinners as continuing sinful, while unable to make them new creatures, is indicated by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>, where, after saying, "The Law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners," he proceeds to add a catalogue of offenders chargeable with the grossest form of criminality; which furnishes a most apt illustration of the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> ("transgressions") which he here uses, and which marks sins in their most wilful and most condemnable character. What was spiritually the outcome of the Law's action upon men's sinful nature, in making their "sin exceeding sinful," the apostle has vividly portrayed in the seventh chapter of the Romans. This last point, however, is probably not even glanced at here; and it is only by straining the sense of <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, that some commentators, notably Meyer, find the apostle to be here stating that the Law was added for the behoof of transgressions, as it were in their interest, to increase and intensify them, as in <a href="../../par/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>, that the trespass might abound. This, however, is not naturally found in the present passage. All that the apostle here states is that the Law merely dealt with sins, having no function in relation to life and righteousness. The article before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> indicates the whole class of objects referred to, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>).

The whole passage is tinctured with the feeling that the giving of the Law, as contrasted with the dispensation of the Messiah, was marked by distance, sternness, alienation. This is the meaning of the mention of "angels" as the medium of communication on the side of Heaven, and of "a mediator" as the selected medium of reception on the side of Israel (compare the contrast between the two dispensations in <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>). This representation of the Law as given through angels is unmistakably made again in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in the words, "The word spoken through angels" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>), where also it is placed in the same contrast with the gospel as spoken by the Lord Jesus, which here is plainly <span class="accented">implied</span>, if indeed it is not expressly alluded to, in the enigmatic words, "but God is one," in the next verse. This view of the Law as communicated through the medium of angels is distinctly referred to by St. Stephen as the accepted belief of the Jewish theologians before whom he spoke: "Ye who received the Law as the ordinances of angels" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-53.htm">Acts 7:53</a>), where the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, forms a remarkable parallel to the words, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, now before us. The same view is put forth by Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:05, 3), "We having learned the most excellent of our doctrines and the most holy part of our Law through angels from God." Such, then, was incontestably the current belief of the Jewish people, both Christian and non-Christian. The Hebrew theologians directed a great deal of attention upon the doctrine of angels, of which the "boundless genealogies" spoken of by St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>) was certainly one diseased branch. We may without improbability suppose that their exegetical sagacity, not unaided by the  Spirit of God promised by him to his people upon their restoration from Captivity, detected the particular fact here indicated in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 19</a>. The countless hosts of his "saints" who attended upon the Lord on that occasion were not surely mere spectators; and to their intervention acting out the volitions of God might be most reasonably ascribed all the physical sights and sounds which gave to the giving of the Law its sensible awfulness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>). "They raised the fire and smoke; they shook and rent the rock; they framed the sound of the trumpet; they effected the articulate voices which conveyed the words of the Law to the ears of the people, and therein proclaimed and published the Law; whereby it became ' the word spoken by angels'" (Owen, 'Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews,' 2:2). <span class="cmt_word">In the hand of a mediator</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>); <span class="accented">by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;</span>, in or by the hand, is unquestionably a Hebraism, being in the Septuagint the ordinary literal rendering of the Hebrew <span class="accented">beyad</span>; see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/numbers/4-37.htm">Numbers 4:37, 45</a>; which passages likewise show us whom the apostle means to designate as the mediator; in reference to which comp. also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>, "I stood between (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the Lord and you at that time [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> at the giving of the Law], to show you the word of the Lord." So Philo ('Vit. Mos.,' 678) speaks of Hoses as acting like a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "mediator and reconciler." Schottgen ('Hor. Hebr.') gives numerous examples from the rabbinical books of this application of the term "mediator "to Moses. This conception of Moses as a mediator seems <span class="accented">implied</span> also in the words, "Mediator of a better covenant" and "Mediator of a new covenant," which we have in <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a> and Hebrews 12:24, with reference to Christ. Evidently the mention of a mediator in the present passage is intended to point to the relations between the Lord and Israel as being those of distance and estrangement. If it be objected that the same inference would be deducible from the description of Christ as "Mediator between God and men," in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, we have it to say, in answer, that Christ, being in his nature both God and man, not only mediates between God and men, having made atonement or reconciliation by his cross, but in his own being unites God and man, abolishing actually that state of mutual alienation which the mediation of Moses by figure implied but could not in reality do away. We, too, were enemies to God before we were reconciled by the death of his Son (<a href="../../par/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>); but now, being reconciled, we are at one with God in Christ: Christ's life in our nature both guaranteeing and effectuating our continued state of reconciliation with the Father as well as our own spiritual and eternal life.

The article with <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, literally, "the mediator," marks the noun as a class noun, giving it the sense, "a mediator as such." Compare the use of the article in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, in "the signs of an apostle" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>); in <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a good man" (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-25.htm">Matthew 12:25</a>); in <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "the labourer is worthy of his hire" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>). The clause means this: a mediator implies the existence of more than one party, of two parties at least, for him to mediate between; of two parties not at one, but standing on such terms towards each other as make his intervention necessary. So far as it characterized the giving of the Law viewed in contrast with the establishment of the covenant of grace, the mediation of Moses, as has been already observed, did not put an end to the estrangement between the Lord and Israel: the estrangement went on throughout Moses' life; throughout, the Israelites stand marked with the brand of "transgression." The genitive <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "of one," is the same as the genitive in <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, literally, "Mediator of God and men," in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>: it marks the party or parties towards whom the function of mediation is exercised; so that what the apostle here affirms is that there cannot be only one such party. <span class="cmt_word">But God is</span> <span class="cmt_word">one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). When we consider the number of interpretations given of this clause in connection with the preceding, which have literally been computed by hundreds (the reader will find a <span class="accented">spieilegium</span> of some sixty or eighty of them in Meyer), we may infer with certainty that the sense which the apostle intended to convey is not an obvious one - not one which lies near the surface. So much appears, however, in the highest degree probable, that he refers either to some disadvantageous circumstance attaching to the Law or to some advantageous circumstance attaching to the covenant of promise, and is viewing the two in contrast the one with the other. On these grounds the present writer has long since acquiesced in the view propounded by Windischmann in his Commentary on this Epistle, and which is accepted by Bishop Ellicott, that the unity here predicated of God is the oneness subsisting between the  Father and the Son. God is one in the Father and in his Son - Christ our Lord. The fact is now present to the apostle's mind, and is presently after stated by him (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), that the Son has been "sent forth" by God to redeem us and make us sons, and has thus become the "Christ," that "Seed of Abraham" to which the promises had been made (ver. 29 of this chapter). Hereby the most perfect oneness is established between God and the heirs of the promise; for these are "clothed with Christ" (ver. 27) the Son of God; and he being one with the Father, they in and through him are really and permanently "reconciled <span class="accented">into</span> God," as the apostle writes in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>. Compare our Lord's words in his intercessory prayer (<a href="../../par/john/17-21.htm">John 17:21, 23</a>), "That they all may be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us. I in them, and thou in me; that they may be perfected into one." That this sense lies deep down in the apostle's words and would not have readily been presented by them to the minds of his readers, forms no valid objection to this interpretation; for the history of the exegesis of the passage proves that this must have been the case with the sense which the apostle really designed to indicate, whatever that was. On the other hand, it is a sense which perfectly suits the requirement of the context; for it illustrates the superiority of the covenant of the promise to the covenant of the Law in the strongest manner possible. The nut has a very hard shell, but it yields a delicious kernel.

Since the apostle has already (vers. 15-18) disposed of the notion that the Law may have superseded or essentially qualified the promise, this word "against" can hardly intend adverse action of that kind, but rather imports simply contrariety of spirit or purpose. This objection the apostle meets by stating that the spirit and purpose of the Law were not contrary to the promises, inasmuch as the Law did not offer to interfere with the work which the promises were to do, but was designed, to be auxiliary to their function by preparing the way for its discharge. <span class="cmt_word">God forbid</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). The tone of abhorrence with which the apostle negatives the inference (see note on Galatians 2:17) is due, not so much to its mere unreasonableness, as to the almost blasphemous character which he feels to attach to the notion.

The noun is first put undetermined, a narrowing determination with the article being then added: "If [in the Law of Moses] had been given a Law such as," etc. By fastening attention upon the Law as unable "to make alive," the apostle marks its character as contrasted with the new covenant, the characteristic function of which is that of imparting a life-giving Spirit. The Law made men feel their sin, their spiritual incapacitation, "the body of death" which enthralled them (<a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>.); but the grace which should instil into their souls the life of love which they lacked, it had not to bestow. So far only reaches the unfavourable estimate of the Law's function given here: it was not "able to make alive." <span class="cmt_word">Verily righteousness should have been by the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">in very deed then from the Law would have accrued righteousness.</span> "In very deed then."

If the Law could have quickened men with spiritual life it would have brought them justification. This is what the apostle here affirms. But why so? That in the economy of grace there is no justification without spiritual quickening, nor spiritual life without justification, we are clearly apprised by many passages of St. Paul's own writings, notably by <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-10</a>. The explanation, however, is probably this: in the apostle's view, the gift of the indwelling Spirit, to sanctify us and enable us for living a spiritual life, is conditioned by a state of acceptableness with God; until we have been brought into a state of grace, we are not qualified to receive this the supreme proof of Divine love. It is "because we are sons that God sends the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>). If, then, the Law can be supposed capable of imparting the Spirit of life, it must be supposed capable of antecedently imparting righteousness. The "inheritance" of Abraham's seed includes both, both accruing to them from faith. So far was the Law from having these gifts to bestrew, that on the one hand, Moses' ministering of the Law to the people was a ministration of condemnation (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-9</a>), and on the other, it brought quickening, indeed, but  not to the sinner's spirit, but to his sin (<a href="../../par/romans/7-9.htm">Romans 7:9</a>). intensifying its malignity and working death (ibid., vers. 10-13). These views, so explicitly expressed by the apostle in the two nearly contemporaneous Epistles just cited, reveal to us what was in his mind when writing, the words before us, and may be properly adduced to explain them.

Here, as in ver. 8, we feel ourselves at liberty not to limit the apostle's reference to one passage, as that cited in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> or ver. 23 of this chapter, but to understand him as including in his scope the teaching of Holy Scripture in both these and other places; having probably in view some such general summary of the contents of God's Word as bearing upon the subject, as he has alleged in <a href="../../par/romans/3.htm">Romans 3</a>. It is highly probable that some such summary, very possibly this identical one with variations, he was wont frequently to employ, as he certainly had constant occasion to do, in reasoning with his fellow-Jews and others, in synagogues and elsewhere. As in ver. 8, so here, the term "Scripture" is so applied as to invest Scripture with a sort of personal agency, which in stricter propriety would be predicated of its Divine Author. We have, in fact, presented to us the action of God himself in his ordering of that older economy, and not merely the statement of Scripture describing the condition of things under it. "Shut it all up under sin;" leaving no loop-hole of escape. The sense of the verb is illustrated by its use in the Septuagint (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>), "Jericho was (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) straitly shut up." God, in the appointments and revelations of the Law, found and pointedly left his people, so to speak, under the operation and overmastering of sin, providing for them therein, and as yet, no such outlet from either its condemnation or its power ("the law of sin," Romans) as he purposed in after times to open for them. The description stands in marked contrast with the blessed liberty predicated in the next chapter of the children of "Jerusalem which is above." This condition of things under the old economy is represented as being only a <span class="accented">provisional</span> ordering of the Divine Disposer, made with a view to a perfect manifestation of delivering goodness to come by-and-by. "Shut up... that," etc. We have a remarkable parallel to this twofold significance of "shut up," both as present and as prospective, in <a href="../../par/romans/11-32.htm">Romans 11:32</a>," God hath shut up all men unto disobedience (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), that he might have mercy upon all;" where likewise the providential ordering of God is spoken of, and not the description of Scripture only.

The term "promise," as connected with the verb "might be given," denotes beyond doubt the thing promised, as in ver. 14, "the promise of the Spirit:" this is "the promise" meant here. Now, if we were to join the words, "by faith of Jesus Christ," with the noun "promise," we should have to understand the two together as meaning," the promise which was made to Abraham because of his faith in Jesus Christ;" and this would be attended with a twofold inconvenience: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the term would have to be taken in two senses in the same sentence; it would first mean here, "the word of promise spoken to Abraham," and then, when immediately after taken with the verb "might be given," it would change its sense into that of "the thing promised;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> this method of construing the sentence would import a new thought, one which did not, so far as we know - it may have done so, perhaps, but there is no proof of it - belong to St. Paul's views of the subject; namely, that "Jesus Christ" - not merely "Christ," but "Jesus Christ" the historical Son of David - was believed in by Abraham. It appears safer, therefore, to connect the words, "by faith of Jesus Christ," with the verb; thus: "that the promise might by faith, as a consequence of faith, of Jesus Christ be given to them that believe." The apostle redoubles the mention of "faith" as the qualification for receiving the gift. "Faith! Faith! with none of your wretched works of ceremonialism! Compare for this iteration of faith, vers. 2-7. He adds, "of Jesus Christ," to "by faith," to mark that the bestowment of the blessing was delayed till Christ should have actually come, to whose line amongst Abraham's posterity the promise had been made. The apostle intimates that the ulterior purpose which God had in view in then "shutting it all up under sin," the purpose which is described in this last sentence, was likewise signified by "Scripture,"  as well as the condition of comparative helplessness and condemnation, under which those subject to the Law were detained. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> is either a class substantive (as <a href="../../par/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>), "<span class="accented">to</span> believers," or the present tense of the participle points to action contemporaneous with that expressed by the verb, "to them that should believe."

The "but" is an-tithetic to the closing clause of ver. 22, from which is taken up afresh the notion of faith, there spoken of as of old destined to become at the proper time the qualifier for the receiving of the promise. "Faith" denotes, not objectively, "the faith," that is, the gospel, as <a href="../../par/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, a sense in which it is seldom used, and which is repelled here by the whole context; but subjectively, the principle of belief in One who gives of mere grace. This, by a bold and surely jubilant figure of speech, is personified as "coming" for men's deliverance, while the "Law" is also personified as the stern custodian under whose charge till then men were detained. Compare the frequent references in the Psalms to "light," "truth," "righteousness," "word," etc., being" sent," "commanded," by the Lord, as in angels, despatched for the help of his saints (<a href="../../par/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/40-11.htm">Psalm 40:11</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/57-3.htm">Psalm 57:3</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/107-20.htm">Psalm 107:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">We were kept under the Law, shut up</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, Revised Text; so, according to Scrivener, L.

Thus ver. 9; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-12.htm">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-16.htm">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:18</a>, in which last passage it is even followed by an imperative, <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> differs from <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> by describing, past action as ending in a result which still continues. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> frequently denotes "prove one's self, ... act as" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>). The Law hath done with us (says the apostle) the work of a child's caretaker (<span class="accented">paedagogus</span>), with an eye to Christ, to whom we have now been banded over. (For the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, see note on ver. 23.) <span class="accented">Paedagogus</span> has no equivalent in the English language; "pedagogue," "schoolmaster," "tutor," "guardian," are all inadequate, covering each one an area of thought more or less quite different. "Tutor,"  as the masculine of "governess," comes perhaps nearest; but a tutor to a gentleman's children is generally an educated man, and often of like rank in life with those he is with; whereas a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span> was usually a slave - an element of thought probably very near to the apostle's consciousness in his present use of the term. In illustration of this and other points bearing upon this subject, the reader will be interested by a passage cited by Bishop Lightfoot out of Plato's 'Lysis' (p. 208, C). Socrates is questioning a young friend. "' They let you have your own ruling of yourself: or do they <span class="accented">not</span> trust you with this, either?' 'Trust me with it, indeed!' he said. 'But as to this, who has the ruling of you?' 'This man here,' he said, 'a <span class="accented">tutor.</span> 'Being a slave, eh?' 'But what of that?' said he; 'yes; only, a slave of our own.' 'An awfully strange thing this,' I said, 'that you, freeman that you are, should be under the ruling of a slave. But further, what does this tutor of yours, as your ruler, do with you?' 'He takes me,' said he, 'to a teacher's house, of course.' 'Do they rule you too, the teachers?' ' Certainly, of course.' 'A mighty number it seems of masters and rulers does your father think proper to set over you.'" Teaching, except possibly of the very first rudiments, was not the <span class="accented">padagogus's</span> business, but only the general care and superintendence of his charge - taking him to and back from his teachers' houses or the schools of physical training, looking after him in his play hours, and the like. In applying to the Law the figure of a <span class="accented">paedagogus</span>, the features which the apostle had in view were probably these: the childhood or non-age of those under its tutelage; their withdrawal from free parental intercourse; their degraded condition probably as being under servile management; the exercise over dram of unsympathizing hardness (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>, "Though ye have ten thousand <span class="accented">tutors</span> in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers"); coercive discipline; the rudimentary character of their instruction (this particular, however, is likewise of questionable application); the temporary and purely provisional nature of the condition under which they were placed; its termination in the full enjoyment of freedom and of participation in their father's inheritance. The clause, "unto Christ," can hardly mean "to bring us to Christ," tempting as this interpretation may seem, in view of the verbal constituent (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>)" bring" in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and of the fact that it was one part of the duty of the child's keeper to take him to his school. For there are the following objections to taking it so: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The child-keeper's relation to his charge did not end with his taking him to school, but continued on throughout his non-age; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the function of Christ is not viewed here as instruction; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> if this construction had been in the apostle's view, he would have written <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, as in the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> ("to the teacher's house") of the passage above cited from Plato. We must, therefore, understand the preposition as in the preceding verse, "with a view to." The next clause is the explanation. <span class="cmt_word">That we might be justified by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">in order that by faith we might get justified.</span> This clause is the most important part of the sentence. Not from the Law was to come righteousness; the Law was no more than introductory or preparatory; righteousness (once more the apostle reminds the Galatians) was to come to us as a free gift through Christ, upon simply our faith, the Law having now nothing to do with us. Hence the emphatic position of the words <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. The apostle does not, in the present connection, make it his business to explain in what way the Law was preparatory, which he does in <a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; his purpose at present is to insist upon its purely provisional character. What we have here is a description of the relation of the Law to God's people viewed collectively; but we can hardly fail to be reminded, that this experience of the collective people of God very commonly finds its counterpart in respect to the ethical bearing of the Law in the experience of each individual believer. Only, we have still to bear in mind that the apostle is thinking of the Law just now more in its ceremonial aspect than its ethical.

The whole course of the argument, however, shows that the persons recited by each of the personal pronouns are in effect the same, namely, the people of God; otherwise this verse would not furnish proof, as by the "for" it professes to do, of the statement of ver. 25. The change from "we" to "ye" has by some been explained as due to the writer's wish to preclude the supposition that the "we' in ver. 25 applied to Jewish believers only. A more satisfactory explanation is that he wishes to give the statement in vers. 22-25, which is general, a more trenchant force as applying to those whose spiritual difficulties he is now dealing with. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:5</a>, "Ye are all sons of light, and sons of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness," we have the converse transition. There likewise the persons recited are in effect the same; and the change of person in the pronoun, making the discourse, from exhortation addressed to others, pass into a form of cohortation applying to all Christians alike, including the writer himself, is dictated by the apostle's sympathetic kindness for especially his Thessalonian converts. "Ye are." The fact that faith is the sole and sufficient ground of qualification eliminates all those distinctions by which the Law has heretofore fenced off Gentiles, pronouncing them "separated as aliens," "strangers to the covenants," and "without God" (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12</a>). In the sequel (ver. 28) the apostle passes on from the thought of this particular outward distinction of Jew and Gentile to the thought of all other purely external distinctions. "In Christ Jesus." It is debated whether this clause should be connected with "faith," as if it were <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the article being omitted, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-15.htm">Ephesians 1:15</a>, and often; or with the words, "ye are sons of God," with a comma following the word "faith." Both modes of construing find in the sentence at last the same contents of thought; for each of the two propositions thus severally formed contains by implication the other. It probably suits the connection best to take the apostle as at once affirming that it is in Christ Jesus that we are God's sons through faith, rather than as leaving this to be inferred from the fact of our being sons through faith in Christ. "In Christ" is, with St. Paul, a very favourite form of indicating the channel through which the great blessings of the gospel are realized (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3, 6, 7, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-6.htm">Ephesians 2:6, 7, 10, 13, 21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-12.htm">Ephesians 3:12</a>, etc.). "Sons of God." It is quite clear that the term "sons" (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) denotes those who have come into the full enjoyment, so far as the present life is concerned, of the position Which their birth had entitled them to; and that it stands in contrast with their earlier position when children in years under a <span class="accented">paedagogus.</span> The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, son, itself, however, while it is never used as synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> to describe one as a child in years, yet, like <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, child, does not ordinarily betoken more than simple relationship as the correlative with "father;" for which reason <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is used in such phrases as "children of disobedience," "of Israel," of light," "of the day," "of the devil," "of perdition." In <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-8</a> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is applied in the case of one who is as yet under the discipline of the rod; but even there <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> of itself immediately designates his filial relation only. St. Paul never uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> at all, though he has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a> for children in years, in place of the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> which he ordinarily employs (<a href="../../par/romans/2-20.htm">Romans 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-13.htm">Hebrews 5:13</a>), and which we find presently after in vers. I and 3 of the next chapter. The particular modification of meaning in which the apostle here uses the term is justified by the consideration which he presently puts forward, that a son of even an opulent or high-born parent, while a mere child, possesses no more freedom than if he were the child of any other person; his heirship or distinction of birth is for so long more or less veiled; it is not until he passes out of his nonage that he appears in his proper character.

"All ye who were baptized;" more literally, "ye, as many as were," etc. The rendering in our Authorized Version, "as many of you as have been baptized," allows of, if it does not suggest, the surmise that the apostle was aware of there being those among the Christians he was writing to who had not been "baptized into Christ." But the context proves the fallacy of this surmise; for the baptism of a part of their body, whatever its consequences to those particular individuals, would have furnished no proof of the foregoing statement, that "all" of those whom he was addressing were "sons of God." The class marked out by the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is clearly coextensive with the "ye all" of ver. 26. The fact is that this <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> marks out a distinct class, not taken out from amongst Christians, but from amongst mankind at large. As compared with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which the apostle might have written instead, it may be regarded as affirming with greater positiveness than <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> would have done, that what is predicated  in the subsequent clause is predicated of every individual belonging to the class defined in this. It may be paraphrased thus: As surely as ever any one of you was baptized into Christ, so surely did he become clothed with Christ. Precisely the same considerations apply to the clause in <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>, "All we who were baptized (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death." A similar paraphrase may be given in ver. 10 of this chapter: So surely as any are of the works of the Law, so surely are they under a curse; and in <a href="../../par/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>, So surely as any are led by the Spirit of God, so surely are these sons of God. Below, in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>, "As many as shall walk by this rule," the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> does mark out a class from among the general body of Christians, who were not all acting thus. So also <a href="../../par/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>, "As many as be perfect." Were baptized into Christ (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). So <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>, "Baptized into Christ Jesus, baptized into his death." The question arises - What is the precise force of the preposition "into" as thus employed with relation to baptism? With the present passage we have to group the following: "Baptizing them into (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) the Name of the Father. and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>); "Were all baptized into (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) Moses in the cloud and in the sea" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>); "In (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) one Spirit were we all baptized into (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) one body" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>), which statement, we must observe, is preceded by the apologue of a body with many members ending with "so also is Christ" (ver. 13). With reference to these passages we may observe that, since in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a> ("We were baptized into one body") the preposition retains its strict sense of "into," and since "Christ" is perpetually set forth as for Christians the sphere of their very existence, <span class="accented">in</span> whom they are that which distinctively they are, it is reasonable to conclude that, when the apostle here and in <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a> uses the expression, "baptized into Christ," he uses the preposition in its strict sense; that is, meaning that Christians are in their baptism brought into that union with, in-being in, Christ which constitutes their life. Nor does <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-2.htm">1 Corinthians 10:2</a>, "were baptized into Moses" (where both the Authorized an d the Revised Versions render, "unto," the latter adding in the margin, "Greek, into"), present any real objection to this view. For in comparing objects together, the apostle not unfrequently puts a very considerable strain upon a phrase when he wishes to bring the two several objects under one category, using it alike of that to which it is most strictly applicable, and of that to which it is not applicable strictly, but only in a very qualified sense. Compare, as a very noteworthy instance of this, his application of the words (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), "communion," "having communion," in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-20</a> (Revised Version); in which the expression, "having communion with devils (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>," is, surely with considerable violence, applied to the case of persons eating things sacrificed to idols; but is applied thus by the apostle because he wishes to present a parallel to that real "communion of the blood, of the body, of Christ," which Christians are privileged to have in the Lord's Supper. Similarly, in vers. 2-4 of the same chapter, for the purpose of exhibiting a parallelism, he strains the expressions," spiritual meat," "spiritual drink," justly and precisely applicable to the Lord's Supper, to apply them to the manna and water from the rock, the meat and drink of the Israelites in the wilderness, although the only justification of their being thus designated consists in their having been supernaturally supplied, and perhaps also that they had a typical meaning. We can thus, then, understand how, with reference to the other sacrament in ver. 2 of the same chapter, he strains the expression, "baptized into," justly descriptive of Christian baptism, by applying it to that quasi-immersion of the Israelites in passing "through the midst of the Red Sea and under the cloud," which he construes into a "baptism" which made them over to a sort of union with, in-being in, Moses, thenceforward their lawgiver and leader. The import of the expression, "baptized into Moses," is to be estimated in the light thrown upon it by the more certain import of the expression, "baptized into Christ;" not this latter to be explained down for the purpose of making it correspond with the other. This view of the clause before us helps us to understand the words in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, "Baptizing them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;" in the comprehension of which we are further assisted by the very remarkable, pregnant use sometimes made in the Old Testament of the word "Name," when it is employed to designate that presence of Divine power and grace which is the security of God's people and the confusion of their enemies (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/75-1.htm">Psalm 75:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27</a>, etc.). For the baptism which brings men "into Christ" brings them into the Name of the triune God as manifested to us in the gospel. Such an interpretation of these words approves itself fully with reference to their use in the supremely solemn hour of spirit-fraught utterance recorded in <a href="../../par/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>; notwithstanding that in other passages, of plain historical narrative, such as <a href="../../par/acts/8-16.htm">Acts 8:16</a> and Acts 19:5, it may be more natural to take the  preposition in the phrase, "baptize into the Name of Christ," in a lower and less determinate sense - either as "unto," "with reference to," or, which seems more probable, as pointing to that professed connection with Christ as his people ("Ye are Christ's," <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>), into which the sacrament brings men. But this lower interpretation, if admitted in those passages, has no claim to dominate our minds when endeavouring to apprehend the full import of the passage now before us, and of <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3</a>. In these the apostle is evidently penetrating into the inmost significance and operation of the rite; and therefore beyond question means to indicate its function, as verily blessed by God for the translation of its faithful recipients into vital union with Christ. For the just comprehension of the apostle's meaning, it is of the utmost consequence to note that he introduces this reference to baptism for the purpose of justifying his affirmation in ver. 26, that in Christ Jesus those whom he is addressing were all sons of God <span class="accented">through faith.</span> This consideration makes it clear that he viewed their baptism as connected with faith. If there was any reality in their action in it at all, if they were not acting an unreal part, their coming to baptism was an outcome of faith on their part in Christ. By voluntarily offering themselves to be baptized into his Name, they were consciously obeying his own instructions: they were manifesting their desire and their resolve to attach themselves to his discipleship and service; to be thenceforth people of his, as by him redeemed, and as expecting at his hands spiritual life here and perfected salvation hereafter. Therefore it was thai they were in their baptism translated "into Christ;" their voluntary act of faith brought them under such operation of Divine grace as made the rite effectual for the transcendent change which the expression indicates; for it is abundantly apparent that a spiritual transition such as this cannot be wrought by a man's own volition or action, but only by the hand of God; as St. John testifies (<a href="../../par/john/1-13.htm">John 1:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Have put on Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">did put on Christ.</span> In <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> we find the imperative used, "Put ye on (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) the Lord Jesus Christ." There the phrase has an ethical application, denoting the adoption of that whole system of habits which characterized the Lord Jesus, and presents in a more definite form that "putting on" of "the new man" which is insisted upon in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-24.htm">Ephesians 4:24</a>. This can hardly be its meaning here; rather it is to be regarded as a more determinate form of the notion of" being justified." The penitent convert, by that decisive action of his faith which by seeking "baptism into Christ" put forth his hand to lay hold of the righteousness which is by faith, became invested with this particular form of "righteousness," namely, that very acceptableness, in the sight of God, which shone in Christ himself. In that hour God "made him acceptable in the Beloved" (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>); endued this poor guilty creature with the loving-kindness with which he regarded his own Son. The middle voice of the Greek verb, though it denotes in <a href="../../par/romans/13-14.htm">Romans 13:14</a> action of the Christian's own, is not to be so far pressed as to exclude the notion of our having in this case been subjected to the action of another. Comp. <a href="../../par/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>, "Until ye be clothed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) with power from on high;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>, "This mortal must put on (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) immortality;" so <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-3.htm">2 Corinthians 5:3</a>. It is the exclusive prerogative of God to justify the sinner; and therefore it must have been by him that the believer became clothed with Christ, not by himself, though it was by his own voluntary act that he came under this operation of the Divine grace. It is, perhaps, impossible more strongly to express the intense character (so to speak) which belongs to the righteousness which comes to us through faith in Christ, than by the form in which it is here exhibited. The apostle, however, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>, uses an expression which may be put by the side of it: "That we might become the righteousness of God in him." It is now clear how completely this verse makes good the affirmation in the preceding one. We have indeed been made sons of God in Christ Jesus if we have become clothed with Christ. For what other in this relation does the phrase, "sons of God," denote as applied to ourselves, than the intense love into the bosom of which God has received us? No higher degree of adoption to be sons is conceivable; though the complete <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of this adoption still remains in the future (<a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>).

N. T.,' &sect; 14, 2, 'Anm.') an adverbialized form of the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, of the same description as the thus accented <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;</span>. The prepositional element implies a somewhat indefinite indication of a sphere in which the statement of the clause holds good. The Revised  Version renders, "there can be," and Bishop Lightfoot, "there is no room for;" but Ecclus. 37:2 and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a> do not much favour this particular modification. In <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a> we have a very similar passage; there, after describing Christians as "having put on (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him," the apostle adds, "Where there is not Gentile [Greek, 'Greek'] and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all [literally, 'all things'] and in all." We may group with them also <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a>, "So also is Christ; for in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews, whether Gentiles [literally, 'Greeks'], whether bondmen, whether freemen." In all three of these passages we see the reference both to "Jew and Gentile" and to "bondman and freeman." The particular mention of these two forms of outward classification was suggested by the circumstances of the Christian Church generally at that time. Wherever the apostles went, they were sure to be confronted by questions and difficulties arising both from the one and from the other. In the kingdom of God were Jew and Gentile, were circumcised and uncircumcised, to stand on the same footing? Should believers as such be concerned to vary their treatment of one another or to modify their own condition from regard to these circumstances? Questionings of this description were being agitated everywhere, and most especially just now in the Galatian Churches. And, on the other point, the universal existence of slavery more or less throughout the civilized world would necessarily give occasion to a variety of questions relative to the position which bondmen should hold in the Christian community; how a bondman on becoming a Christian should stand, or what he should do, in respect to obedience to his owner or to seeking a change in his condition. St. Paul, in his Epistles, has briefly discussed some of these points, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-20.htm">1 Corinthians 7:20-24</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-9</a>. So often had the apostle occasion to affirm the perfect identity of Christian privilege possessed by all believers in Christ, that the statement would naturally mould itself into a sort of formula. In Colossians he varies the form by inserting "barbarian, Scythian;" degrees of national civilization made no difference. In place of this, he here adds the particular, that diversity of sex made no difference. We cannot tell what especial reason he had for introducing these modifications in writing to the Colossians and the Galatians respectively. Possibly he had none beyond the pleasure which he felt in dilating on the large catholicity of the Divine grace. In the clause, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>, "there is here no male and female," the neuter is used (remarks Alford) as being the only gender which will express both. The change of form, "male <span class="accented">and</span> female," from "<span class="accented">no</span> Jew <span class="accented">nor Gentile</span>," "<span class="accented">no</span> bondman <span class="accented">nor</span> freeman," was perhaps suggested by the passage in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;</span>), "<span class="accented">male</span> and female created he them," which is quoted in <a href="../../par/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>. If so, the clause may be regarded (as Bishop Lightfoot says) as forming a climax: "<span class="accented">even</span> the primeval distinction of male and female." But perhaps the change is simply made for the sake of variety; as in the way in which several of the classes are introduced in the Colossians. <span class="cmt_word">For ye are all one in Christ</span> <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> (<span class="greek_word">pa/nte ga\r u(mei  =   ei  =  </span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">for all ye are one and the same man in Christ Jesus.</span> The pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, ye, is inserted to recite emphatically the qualification already expressed; as if it were, "ye being what ye are, believers baptized into Christ." The apostle's object here is not, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11-15</a>, to exhort to the performance of certain mutual duties on the ground of the unity which in Christ is established among all believers, but to enforce the view that each individual's title to the inheritance is altogether irrespective of external distinctions, and is based entirely, in one case as well as in another, upon his being clothed with Christ. The word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> is "one and the same," as in <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">of</span> one mind" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>); and in <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "<span class="accented">One</span> and the same God, one and the same Mediator" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). So Chrysostom: "<span class="accented">T</span>h<span class="accented">at</span> is, we have all one form and one mould, even Christ's. What," he adds, "can be more awful than these words? He that was a Greek, or Jew, or bondman yesterday, carries about with him the form, not of an angel or archangel, but of the Lord of all, yea, displays in his own person the Christ." The <span class="accented">distribution</span> of the universal quality to each individual, so far as the grammar of the sentence is concerned, is imperfectly expressed. But the grammatical inadequacy of the verbal exposition is not greater than in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-5.htm">1 Corinthians 6:5</a>, "Decide (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) between his brethren," literally, "<span class="accented">between</span> his brother;" and in vers. 19, 20 of the same chapter, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">your</span> body;" not "thy body," nor "your bodies." The apostle has in view the subjective application only of the principle here stated; each was to feel that, having the qualification which he has explained, he himself is a son of God and full inheritor, without casting about for any further qualification, as, for example, from  ceremonial Judaism. The principle plainly is pregnant with an objective application also; namely, as to the manner in which they were to estimate and treat each other and every baptized believer, notwithstanding any circumstances of extrinsic diversity whatever.

For the preceding verse is no digression, requiring us to render this <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> "but," but simply an amplification of the notion of putting on Christ in ver. 27; and the present clause recites that previous conclusion, to serve for a premiss to a further conclusion. "Are Christ's;" comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>, "And ye are Christ's, and Christ is God's." This genitive here, as also there, denotes the closest and most intimate approximation conceivable, "Christ's own;" covering, in fact, the notion of being clothed with Christ; and expresses what that "one and the same man" is, which according to ver. 28 in Christ Jesus all had become.

In ver. 7 the apostle has affirmed that they who are of faith are sons of Abraham; in ver. 16, that the promises were made to Abraham and "his seed, which is Christ." We have seen that in that ver. 16 "Christ" appears to mean that branch of Abraham's offspring which was, so to speak, to proceed from Christ and was to be called by his name. If, however, "Christ" be there taken to mean the individual Son of Abraham, Jesus, then those who believe in him and have been baptized into him are to be understood as here affirmed to be "Abraham's seed," because, being clothed with Christ. they share his position. The same result is arrived at either way. <span class="cmt_word">And heirs according to the promise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> [which word is rejected by recent editors] <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">heirs in pursuance of a promise.</span> "Heirs," not of Abraham, but of God; for the notion connects itself with that of the sonship to God, which has been predicated in ver. 26 of believers in Christ; and these two united conceptions form the topic of the first seven verses of the next chapter. This is in accordance with <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16, 17</a>, "We are children of God; and if children, also heirs; heirs of God, joint-heirs with Christ." It goes upon the same lines of thought as the statement made above in ver. 16, that the promises were spoken, not to Abraham only, but also to his seed as well; the seed being conceived of by the apostle, not as inheriting from Abraham, but as holding an independent position of their own at his side. The benefits accruing to them have been styled "the inheritance" in ver. 18, which verse also serves to illustrate the spirit of the clause now before us, by affirming that the inheritance was a free gift of God conveyed by a promise, and not one to be either gained or made sure by obedience to a ceremonial law as the Galatians were in danger of supposing. The article is wanting before "promise' here, as it was also in ver. 18; because the apostle is not thinking immediately of the <span class="accented">terms</span> of the promise, but rather of its distinctive character as a promise, betokening a free gift of God. The inheritance is no doubt the adoption of sons, both in its firstfruits in this life and in its complete manifestation hereafter in the bliss and glory of heaven (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../galatians/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Galatians 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Galatians 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../galatians/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Galatians 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Galatians 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/galatians/4.htm"><title>Galatians 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/galatians/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/galatians/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/galatians/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../galatians/3.htm" title="Galatians 3">&#9668;</a> Galatians 4 <a href="../galatians/5.htm" title="Galatians 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now I say, <i>That</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I say</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>). A form of expression usual with the apostle when introducing a new statement designed either to explain or elucidate something before said (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>, according to the Received Text; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>.

It is intended apparently to quicken attention: "Now I wish to say this." In the present case the apostle designs to throw further light upon the position taken in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, that God's people, while under the Law, were under a bondage from which they have now been emancipated. Compare the somewhat similar process of illustration adopted in <a href="../../par/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2-4</a>. In both passages it is not a logical demonstration that is put forward, but an illustratively analogous case in human experience. A metaphor, though not strictly an argument, yet frequently helps the reader to an intuitive perception of the justness of the position laid down. <span class="cmt_word">That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">so long as the heir is a child</span>, <span class="accented">he differeth nothing from a bondservant</span>, <span class="accented">though he is lord of all.</span> The article before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, heir, is the class article, as before <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, mediator (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-20.htm">Galatians 3:20</a>) - "an heir." In the word <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the apostle evidently has in view one who as yet is in his nonage - as in English law phrase, "an infant."

In Attic Greek, the correlate to one registered amongst "men" was a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>. It does not appear that the apostle means to use a technical legal expression. He contrasts <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-11.htm">1 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13, 14</a>.

These speeches also show that the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> was entrusted with the handling of the property of his ward. Yet, as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> more especially denotes one entrusted with the management of property, it should seem that St. Paul uses the former term with more especial reference to the guardian's control over the <span class="accented">person</span> of his ward. The ward has to do what the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, guardian, thinks proper, with no power of ordering his actions according to his own will; while, on the other hand, the youth is not able to appropriate or apply any of his property further than as the "steward" thinks right; between the two he is bound hand and foot to other people's control. The plural number of the two nouns indicates the rough and general  way in which the apostle means to sketch the case; speaking in a general way, one may describe a minor as subject to "guardians and stewards." <span class="cmt_word">Until the time appointed of the father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, properly an adjective, <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being understood, is used very commonly to denote, either a determined period during which a thing is to be done or forborne, which is its most ordinary sense (see Reiske's 'Lexicon to Demosthenes'); or the further limit of such a period, whence Symmachus uses it to render the Hebrew word for "end" in <a href="../../par/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>; or, lastly, a specified time at which a certain thing was to take place, as, for example, Josephus, 'Ant.,' 7:04, 7, "When the (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) day appointed for the payment came." This last seems to be the meaning of the word here, though it admits of being taken in the second sense, as describing the limit of the child's period of nonage. The somewhat loosely constructed genitive, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "of the father," may be compared either with the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "taught of God" (<a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>), or, in a somewhat different application, "the chastening and admonition of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>). In reference to the whole case as stated by the apostle, it has been asked - Is the father to be conceived of as dead, or as only gone out of the country, or how? It is sufficient to reply that "the point of the comparison" - to use Bishop Lightfoot's words - "lies, not in the circum stances of the father, but of the son;" and, further, that to supplement the description which the apostle gives by additional particulars not relevant for the purpose of the comparison would only tend to cloud our view of its actual import. In fact, any image taken from earthly things to illustrate things spiritual will inevitably, if completely filled out, be found to be in some respects halting. Another inquiry has engaged the attention of commentators, as to how far the particular circumstance, that the period of nonage is made dependent upon the father's appoint meat, can be shown to agree with actual usage as it then obtained. It would seem that no positive proof has hitherto been alleged that such an hypothesis was in strict conformity with either Greek or Roman or Hebrew law. And hence some have had recourse to the precarious and far-fetched supposition that St. Paul founds his thesis on Galatian usage, arguing that such would have been in accordance with that purely arbitrary control which, according to Caesar ('Bell. Gall.,' 6:19), a paterfamilias exercised over wife and children among the kindred tribes in Gaul. The scruple, how ever, now referred to arises from supposing that we know more about the facts than we really do know. So far as has been shown, we cannot tell what was really the precise rule of procedure which, in the case described by the apostle, prevailed either in Judaea, or in Tarsus, or in Galatia; nor again from what region of actual experience St. Paul drew his illustration. We, therefore, have no possible right to say that the case which he supposes was not fairly supposable. On the contrary, when we reflect how open the apostle's mind was for taking note of facts about him, and how wide and varied his survey, we may safely rest assured that his supposed case was in reality framed in perfect accordance to the civil usage, to which the Galatians would understand him to refer. At the same time, it must be conceded that, amongst different modes of arranging a minor's case which actual usage permitted or may be imagined to have permitted, the apostle selected just that particular mode which would best suit his present immediate purpose.

The plural pronoun recites, not individuals, but the community viewed as a whole, having the now subsisting "us" as its present representatives. Individually, Christians in general now, and many of those who then when the apostle wrote belonged to the Church, never were in the state of nonage or bondage here referred to. It is, however, notwithstanding this, quite supposable that St. Paul's account of the history of the whole society is in some degree tinted by the recollection of his own personal experiences. <span class="cmt_word">When we were children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); that is, when we were in our nonage. The phrase is not meant to point to a state of immaturity in personal development, but simply to the period of our being withheld from the full possession of our inheritance. This is all that the course of thought now pursued requires; and we only create for ourselves superfluous embarrassment by carrying further the parallel between the figuring persons and the figured. The spiritual illumination enjoyed by the Christian Church, compared with that of the pre-Christian society, presents as great a contrast as that of a man's knowledge compared with a child's; but that is not the point here. <span class="cmt_word">Were in bondage under the elements</span> (or, <span class="accented">rudiments</span>) <span class="accented">of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world</span>; or, <span class="accented">were under the rudiments of the world brought into bond-service.</span> This latter way of construing, separating <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> from the participle  <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> to connect it with the words which precede, is recommended by the parallel, which the words, "were under the rudiments of the world," then present to the words," is under guardians and stewards," in ver. 2; while the participle "brought into bond-service" reproduces the notion expressed by the words, "is no better than a bond-servant," of ver. 1. The participle "brought into bond-service," then, stands apart, in the same way as the participle "shut up "does in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>. This, however, is only a question of style; the substantial elements of thought remain the same in either way of construing. The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> calls for a few remarks, founded upon the illustration of its use given by Schneider in his 'Greek Lexicon.' From the primary sense of "stakes placed in a row," for example, to fasten nets upon, the term was applied to the letters of the alphabet as placed in rows, and thence to the primary constituents of speech; then to the primary constituents of all objects in nature, as, for example, the four "elements" (see <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a> ); and to the "rudiments" or first "elements" of any branch of knowledge. It is in this last sense that it occurs in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a>, "What are the (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) rudiments (of the beginning, or) of the first principles of the oracles of God" (on which compare the passage from Galen quoted by Alford at the place). This must be the meaning of the word here; it recites the rudimental instruction of children, as  if the apostle had said "under the A, B, C, of the world." This is evidently intended to describe the ceremonial Law; for in ver. 5 the phrase, "those under the Law," recites the same persons as are here described as "under the rudiments of the world;" as again the "weak and beggarly rudiments," in ver. 9, are surely the same sort of" rudiments" as are illustrated in ver. 10 by the words, "Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years." Since the Law under which the people of God were placed was God's own ordinance, we must infer that, when it is here designated as "the A, B, C, of the world," the genitive can neither denote the origin of these rudiments nor yet any qualification of moral pravity, but only the qualification of imperfection and inferiority; that is, it denotes the ceremonial institution s of the Law as appertaining to this earthly material sphere of existence, as contrasted with a higher spiritual sphere. Thus "the A, B, C, of the world" is an expression as nearly as possible identical with that of "carnal ordinances" (literally, <span class="accented">ordinances of the flesh</span>), used to describe the external ceremonialism of the Law in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>; which phrase, like the one before us, is used with a full recognition, in the word "ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), of the Law as of Divine appointment, while the genitive "of the flesh" marks its comparative imperfection. They were, as Conybeare paraphrases, "their childhood's elementary lessons of outward things." This designation of Levitical ceremonies as being an "A, B, C," or "rudiments, of the world," appears to have become a set phrase with the apostle, who uses it again twice in the Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>), where he appears, if we may judge from the context, to have in view a (perhaps mongrel) form of Jewish ceremonialism which, with circumcision (mentioned in ver. 11), conjoined other "ordinances" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) mentioned in vers. 14, 20, relating to meats and drinks and observance of times, illustrated in vers. 16, 21. This, he tells the Colossians, might have been all very well if they were still "living in the world" (ver. 20); but now they were risen with Christ! - with Christ, who had taken that "bond" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 14) out of the way; and therefore were called to care for higher things than such merely earthly ones as these. Some suppose that the apostle has reference to the religious ceremonialisms of the idolatrous Gentiles, as well as those of the Mosaic Law. These former ceremonialisms belonged, indeed, to "the world," both in the sense above pointed out and as tinged with the moral pravity characterizing the "present evil world" in general. But these cannot be here intended, forasmuch as it was not to such that God's people were by his ordinance subjected. The other rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> - "elements" - which the Authorized Version puts into the text, but the Revised Version into the margin, was probably selected in deference to the view of most of the Fathers, who, as Meyer observes, took the Greek word in its physical sense: Augustine referring it to the heathen worship of the heavenly bodies and the other cults of nature; Chrysostom, Theodoret, and Ambrose to the new moons and sabbaths of the Jews, viewed as determined by the motions of the sun and moon; Jerome, however, interpreting it <span class="accented">rudimenta discipliner.</span> On the other hand, in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8, 20</a>, both of our Versions have "rudiments" in the text and "elements" in the margin; in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 12</a>, "elements" only. "Brought into bend-service" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), namely, by the act of the supreme Father imposing upon us the yoke of his Law.

So <a href="../../par/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f69;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "When he was well-nigh forty years old;" literally," When there was being completed to him a time of forty years" (comp. also <a href="../../par/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-27.htm">Acts 24:27</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/1-57.htm">Luke 1:57</a>). The substantive (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) "completion" occurs in the same sense in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>, "Dispensation of the completion of the times." The apostle might apparently have written <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "But when the term was completed;" but he prefers to express it in this particular form, as colouring the idea with a certain pathos of solemn joy at the arrival of a time so long expected, so fraught with blessing (compare the use of the verb "came" in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-25.htm">Galatians 3:25</a>). Why the supreme Disposer, the Father of his people, chose that particular era in the history of the human race for his children's passing into their majority is a deeply interesting subject of inquiry. Much has been said, as for example by Neander and Guerieke in their Histories of the Church, and by Schaff in his History of the Apostolic Church, on the preparedness of the world at large at just that juncture for the reception of the gospel. It may, however, be questioned whether the apostle had this in his mind in the reference here made to the Divine <span class="accented">prothesmia.</span> So far as appears, his view was fastened upon the history of the development of God's own people, which up to this time had been under the pedagogic custody of the Mosaic Law. Indeed, in just this context he does not even advert, as he may be supposed to have done in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, to the effect produced by the Law in preparing God's own people for the gospel, but speaks only of the negative aspect of the legal economy; that is, of those features of "bondage," "powerlessness," and "poverty" which marked it as a state of oppression and helplessness. The training, probably implied in the reference to its "rudiments," stands back for the present out of view; the only notion which is actually brought prominently forward being the comparatively degraded condition in which the child-proprietor was for that while detained. <span class="cmt_word">God sent forth his Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f51;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The terms here used require to be very closely considered: they arc fraught with the very essence of the gospel. The compound verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> occurs in nine other places of the New Testament, all of them in St. Luke's Gospel and the Acts. In six of these (<a href="../../par/luke/1-53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/20-10.htm">Luke 20:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>) the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> is well represented in our English Bible by "away." In the remaining three (<a href="../../par/acts/7-12.htm">Acts 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-22.htm">Acts 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>) - "(Jacob) sent forth our fathers first;" "They sent forth Barnabas as far as to Antioch;" "God hath sent forth his angel")  - the preposition represented by "forth" expresses with more or less distinctness the idea that the person sent belonged intimately to the place or the society of the person who sent him. In no one passage is it without its appreciable value. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>, without this second prepositional adjunct of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>, is used, for example, in <a href="../../par/john/17-18.htm">John 17:18</a>, both of the Father sending the Son and of Christ sending his apostles" into the world," but without putting forward this indication of previous intimate connection. So the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;</span> is used in like manner of God sending his Son in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, and of the mission of the Holy Spirit in <a href="../../par/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>. It was, no doubt, optional with the writer or speaker whether he would employ a verb denoting this particular shade of meaning present in the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> or not; but we are not, therefore, at liberty to infer that, when he chooses to employ a verb which does denote it, he uses it without a distinct consciousness of its specific force. In the clause before us, therefore, as also in ver. 6, the writer must be assumed to have had in his mind at least the thought of heaven as the sphere of existence from which the Son and the Spirit were sent, as in <a href="../../par/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a> above cited, if not of some yet closer association with the Sender. The reference to a previously subsisting intimacy of being between the Sender and the Sent, which we trace here in the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> of the compound verb, is in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, where the verb employed is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, indicated in the emphatic reference implied in the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "sending <span class="accented">his</span> own Son." In endeavouring next to determine the import of the expression," his Son," as here introduced, we are met by the surmise that the apostle may have written it <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, or by anticipation; that is, as describing, not what Christ was before he was sent forth, but the glory and acceptableness with the Almighty which marked him as the Messiah after his appearing in the world; for when, for example, in another place the apostle writes," Christ Jesus came into the world to rove sinners," he must be understood as expressing himself <span class="accented">proleptically</span>, designating the person who came into the world by the name and office which he bore as among men, and not as he was before he came. A <span class="accented">proleptic</span> designation is therefore conceivable. But this interpretation of the apostle's meaning is resisted by the tendency of the context in the kindred passage in <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>, "God sending his own Son <span class="accented">in the likeness of the flesh of sin</span>;" for those added words betoken very strongly that Christ was viewed by the apostle as having been God's Son before he appeared in the flesh. And such is the impression which a reader not preoccupied with other  ideas would naturally receive also here. The conviction that this is what the apostle really intended is corroborated by references which he elsewhere makes to Christ's pro-incarnate existence and work; as, for example, in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15, 16</a>; the latter of which passages, by describing "the Son of God's love" as "the Firstborn of every creature, because by him all things were created" (see Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' on the passage), betokens that St. Paul regarded him as having been even then the "Son of God;" and this, too, in the sense of derivation from "the substance of the Father, ... begotten" (as the Nicene Creed recites) "of his Father before all worlds." We may, therefore, reason, ably believe that the Apostle Paul, whose views alone are now under consideration, recognized these two senses of the term, namely, the theological and the Christologieal, as inseparably blending into one when thus applied to the Lord Jesus; for we must allow that it appears alien to his manner of sentiment and of representation to suppose that he ever uses it in the purely theological sense only. In the view of the apostle Christ was the "Son of God," not only when appointed to be the Messiah, but also before he was "made to be of a woman." Indeed, it should seem that this conception of his person is just that which forms the basis for the subsequent statement that the object of his coming into the world was to procure the adoption of sons for us. <span class="cmt_word">Made of a woman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">made to be of a woman.</span> This, indeed, was probably the sense intended by King James's translators, when they followed Wicklife and the Geneva Bible in rendering "made of a woman;" whilst Tyndale and Cranmer, followed by the Revisers of 1881, give "born of a woman." Just the same divergency of renderings appears in the same English translations in <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, "made of the seed of David (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;</span>)," except that Tyndale has "begotten" instead of "born." The difference in sense is appreciable and important: "made" implies a previous state of existence, which "born" does not. So far as the present writer can find, wherever in the New Testament the Authorized Version has "born," we have in the Greek either <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> never having this sense at all. As in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), "Being made a curse for us," and in <a href="../../par/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "The Word was made flesh;" so here God's Son is described as "made to be of a woman," the phrase, "of a woman," being nearly identical in import with the word "flesh" in St. John, distinctly implying the fact of the Incarnation. The preposition "of" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span>) denotes derivation of being, as when it is found after the verb "to be" in <a href="../../par/john/8-47.htm">John 8:47</a>, "He that is of God;" "Ye are not of God," pointing back to the claim which (ver. 41) the Jews had made that they had God for their Father. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to come to be, with a preposition occurs frequently, as in <a href="../../par/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-7.htm">Romans 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>. There can be no doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken in the next clause with the same meaning as here. <span class="cmt_word">Made under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, <span class="accented">made to be under the Law.</span> The "Law" here, as in the clause immediately after "those under the Law," indicates, not Law in general, but that particular law of tutorship and of domination over one as yet in the depressed condition of a minor, which the apostle has just before spoken of; that is, a law of ceremonies and of external cult. The article is wanting in the Greek, as in <a href="../../par/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, etc. We cannot be unconscious of a tone of pathos in the apostle's language, thus declaring that he who had before been no less august a being than God's Son, should in conformity with his Father's will have stooped to derive being "from a woman," as well as to become subject to such a Law of servitude as that of Moses was. In the second chapter of the Philip-plans we have a similar account of the Incarnation, in which, with similar pathos, the apostle remarks that he took upon him the form of a "bond-servant" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), being made to be in the like condition to that of men (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); but in that passage the line of thought does not lead to a definite reference of his being made subject to the ceremonial Law. The apostle probably thinks of Christ as being made subject to the Law by his being circumcised; a child of Israelite parents, so long as he was uncircumcised, was repudiated by the Law as one not in the covenant. With reference to the preceding clause," made of a woman," we are naturally led to inquire why this particular was specified. It does not appear to be essential to his argument, as the next clause certainly is. Probably it was added as marking one of the successive steps down which the Son of God descended to that subjection ("servitude," ver. 3) to the ceremonial Law which the apostle is most particularly concerned with. As in <a href="../../par/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a>. he is exhibited, first as emptying himself; next, as taking upon him the form of a bond-servant by being made man; and then at length as brought to "the death of the cross;" so here, more briefly, he appears as "sent forth" from the bosom of the Father; next, as made "the son of a woman;" then as brought under the Law, to the end that (of course by the Crucifixion)  he might buy off from under the Law those who were subject  thereto. If the apostle intended anything more definite by introducing this first clause, it may have been to glance at that fellowship with the whole human race, with all "born of women" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>), into which God's own Son came by becoming himself "of a woman" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). To refer to yet another point, we can fearlessly affirm that this sentence of the apostle is perfectly <span class="accented">consistent</span> with the belief in the writer's mind that our Lord was born of a <span class="accented">virgin-mother</span>, for a specified reference to this fact did not lie in his way just at present, and therefore is not to be desiderated. The only point for consideration in this respect is whether the expression employed does at all allude to it. Many have thought that it does. But when we consider that "one born of woman." <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in Hebrew <span class="accented">yelud isshah</span>, was a set phrase to denote a human creature (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/11-11.htm">Matthew 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/job/14-1.htm">Job 14:1</a>; <a href="../../par/job/15-14.htm">Job 15:14</a>; <a href="../../par/job/25-4.htm">Job 25:4</a>; <a href="../../par/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a> [Septuagint]), with no particular reference to the woman except as the medium of our being introduced into the world, it has been with much probability judged by most recent critics that the clause shows no colouring of such allusion. Nevertheless, we distinctly recognize in it the sentiment expressed in the familiar verse of the ancient hymn: "Tu, ad liberandum suscepturus hominem, <span class="accented">non horruisti</span> virginis <span class="accented">uterum</span>;" else, why did not the apostle write <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>?

But why, in order to effect this object, was it prerequisite, as it is here implied that it was, that he should be himself "brought under the Law"? The directions which the Law in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22, 23</a> gave with respect to those "hanged on a tree" were apparently held by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 27</a>) to apply also to the case of persons so hanged who were not Israelites. If so, does it not follow (an objector may say) that Jesus, even if not an Israelite under the Law, would, however, by being crucified, have fallen under the curse of the Law, and thereby annihilated the Law for all who by faith should become partakers with him, whether Jews or Gentiles? why, then, should be have been brought under the Law? The objection is met by the consideration that, in order that Christ might abrogate the Law by becoming subject to its curse, it was necessary that he should himself be perfectly acceptable to God, not only as being the eternal "Son of his love," but also in the entire completeness of his life as a man, and, therefore, by perfect obedience to the will of God as declared in the Law, under which it had pleased God to place his people. The Law, whatever the degradation which its ceremonial institute inferred for "the sons of God" subjected to it, was, nevertheless, for the time, God's manifest ordinance, to which all who sought to serve him were bound to submit them&deg; selves. They could not be righteous before him unless they walked in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless (<a href="../../par/luke/1-6.htm">Luke 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That we might</span> <span class="cmt_word">receive the adoption of sons</span> (<span class="greek_word">i%na th\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); that is, that our adoptive sonship might be actually and in full measure made over to us. The" we" recites God's people; the same persons as those indicated by the preceding phrase, "those which were under the Law," which phrase was not meant to define one particular class among God's people, but to describe the condition in which God's people had been placed. Their Father had put them under the Law with the view of their being at his appointed time bought off from the Law and admitted to the full enjoyment of their filial privileges. This purpose of their Father, signified beforehand in the promises to Abraham, explains the article before <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>: it was the adoptive sonship which had been guaranteed to them.

The second <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> is subordinate to the first; the deliverance of God's people from the Law was in order to their introduction into their complete state of sonship. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> does not appear to occur in any Greek writer except St. Paul; though <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, are found in various authors. After the analogy of other compound verbal nouns with a similar termination (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, etc.), it means first the <span class="accented">act</span> of adoption, as, perhaps, <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a>; and then, quite naturally, the consequent condition of the adopted child, as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a>; and this seems its more prominent sense here. <a href="../../par/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4</a> suggests the surmise  that the term had been in use before among Palestinian Jews, with reference to Israel's state under the theocracy, and that St. Paul borrowed it thence with reference to the Christian Church, in which it found a more complete realization. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And because ye are sons</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). The apostle is adducing proof that God's people had actually received the adoption of sons; it was because it was so, that God had sent into their hearts the Holy Spirit, imparting that vivid consciousness of sonship which they enjoyed. The fact of the adoption must have been there, to <span class="accented">qualify</span> them to be recipients of this divinely inspired consciousness. The affirmation in <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>, "The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit that we are children of God," closely resembles our present passage; but it is not identical. We are not made sons (the apostle intimates) by the Spirit giving us the consciousness of sonship; but, having been previously made sons, the Spirit raises in our spirits sentiments answering to the filial relation already established. The position of the clause introduced by "because" is like that in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-15.htm">1 Corinthians 12:15, 16</a>. The persons recited by the "ye" are still God's people; not the Galatian believers in particular, except as a portion of the whole Church of God. The apostle puts the thought in this form to bring the truth more strikingly home to their minds. This he does more closely still in the next verse by "thou." But that he has in view God's people as a whole is clear, not only from the whole strain of the context, but also from the phrase, "into our hearts," in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">God</span> <span class="cmt_word">hath sent forth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">God sent forth.</span> The tense indicates that the apostle does not refer to a sending forth of God's Spirit to each individual believer, parallel to that "sealing" which believers are stated to be subjects of in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>. This historic aorist, as it does in ver. 4, points to one particular emission - that by which the Comforter was sent forth to take up his dwelling in the Church as his temple through all time (<a href="../../par/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of his Son</span>. The Spirit which "anointed" Jesus to be the <span class="accented">Christ</span>; which throughout animated the God-Man Jesus; which prompted him in full filial consciousness, himself in a certain critical hour with loud outcry (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a>) to call out, "Abba, Father!" The phrase, "his Son," is aetiological; by it the apostle intimates that it was only congruous that the Spirit which had animated the whole life of the incarnate Son should be shed forth upon those who by faith become one with him, and should manifest his presence with them, as well as their union with Christ, by outcome of sentiment similar to that which Christ had expressed. Since the sonship of Christ is here spoken of as if it were not merely antecedent, but also in some way preparatory to the sending forth of the Spirit, it best suits the connection to construe it, not, as in ver. 4, as that belonging to him in his preincarnate state of being, but as that which appertained to him after being "made to be of a woman," and in which his disciples might be considered as standing on a certain footing of parity with him. This harmonizes with the relation which in the Gospels and Acts the sending of the Spirit is represented as holding to his resurrection and ascension. The interpretation above given in one point presupposes the apostle's knowledge of the story of the agony in the garden, when, according to St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>), Jesus himself used the words, "Abba. Father." This presupposition is warranted, not only by the probabilities of the case, but also by what we read in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a> of the Epistle to the Hebrews, Pauline, certainly, if not actually St. Paul's. We have to add that the Gospels not only make repeated mention of our Lord as addressing the Supreme Being by the compellative of "Father," but also represent him as constantly speaking of God as bearing that relation both to himself and to his disciples. This mode of designating the Almighty was characteristic in the highest degree of Jesus, and up to that time, so far as appears in the Scriptures, unknown. The manner in which the apostle here speaks of the "sending forth" of the Spirit in close proximity to the mention of the "sending forth" of the Son, strongly favours the belief that he regarded the Spirit, as being also a personal agent. In <a href="../../par/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a> we have in the Septuagint "Thou wilt send forth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) thy Spirit, and they will be created." In <a href="../../par/psalms/43-3.htm">Psalm 43:3</a> and Psalm 57:3 God is implored to "send forth [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint] his light and his truth," "his mercy and his truth;" these being poetically personified as angelic messengers. <span class="cmt_word">Into your</span> <span class="cmt_word">hearts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). But this reading of the Textus Receptus <span class="accented">is</span>, by recent editors, replaced by the reading, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">into our hearts</span>, the other reading being regarded as a correction designed to conform this clause with the words, "ye are sons," in the preceding one. In both cases the apostle has in his view the Church of God viewed generally. His putting "our" here instead of "your" was probably an outcome of his feeling of proud gladness in the thought of his own happy experience. A precisely similar change in the pronoun, attributable probably to the same cause, is observable in the remarkably analogous passage in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>,  "Ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father." <span class="accented">Crying</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">crying out aloud.</span> The word expressing loud utterance betokens in this case undoubting assurance. No faint whisper this of an inner consciousness, shy, reticent, because afraid to assure itself of so. glorious, so blissful a relation; no hesitating half-hope; it is a strong, unwavering conviction, bold, though humbly bold, to thus address the all-holy Supreme himself. The "cry" is here attributed to the Spirit himself; in <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a> to believers, these being the Spirit's organs of utterance; presently after in the Romans, vers. 26, 27, the Spirit himself is said to "intercede with groanings which cannot be uttered ...  . according to the will of God." Analogously, in the Gospels, evil spirits in demoniacs at times are said to "cry out" (<a href="../../par/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/9-26.htm">Mark 9:26</a>), while in other passages the cry is attributed to the possessed person. Abba, Father (<span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>). In addition to <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, just cited, the same remarkable words are found once only besides, in <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, as uttered by our Lord in the garden. St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>) gives only "Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>); St. Matthew (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>), "my Father" (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: in ver. 39, however, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is omitted by Tischendorf, though he retains it in ver. 42). St. Matthew, by adding <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> here, which he does not add in Matthew 11:25, 26, seems to indicate that the form of address which our Lord then employed bespoke more than usual of fervency or of intimacy of communion. According to Furst ('Concordance'), "<span class="accented">Abba</span>," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, occurs frequently in the Targums "<span class="accented">sensu</span> proprio et honorifico;" in the Jerusalem Targum taking the form "Ibba," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>. In consequence, we may assume, of the "honorific" complexion of this form of the word, it was in Chaldee the form usually employed in compellation, or for the vocative. The hypothesis that either the Divine Sneaker, or the Evangelist Mark, or the Apostle Paul, added <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> as an explanatory adjunct to the Aramaic "Abba," for the benefit of such as might need the explanation, is resisted <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the threefold recurrence of the conjoined phrases in just the same form; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the absence of any such intimation of a translation as we find given in other passages where an Aramaic word is explained, as in <a href="../../par/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11, 34</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-38.htm">John 1:38, 41, 42</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-16.htm">John 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> being made by St. Paul in the Romans, when writing with a glowing ardour of strong feeling wholly repugnant to the didactic calmness of a translational gloss: he does not pause to add such a gloss to "Maranatha" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, where it would seem to be much more called for. The apparently nominatival form of <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> lends no countenance to this view, as is shown by the comparison of <a href="../../par/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>: <a href="../../par/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54, 41</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span>: and in the Septuagint, <a href="../../par/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1, 9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="../../par/psalms/7-1.htm">Psalm 7:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Another hypothesis that the twofold compellative was meant to intimate that God was now Father alike to Jewish believers and to Gentile, is wrecked upon its occurrence in St. Mark. The present writer ventures to surmise that the conjoined phrase originated thus: The Lord Jesus, being wont very commonly to substitute for the name "God" the designation of "Father," may be supposed to have used for this designation the word "Abba" as the honorific form of the Chaldaic noun for "father," in much the same way as the Jews regularly substituted the noun <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, an honorific form of <span class="accented">Adonim</span>, "lord," or "master," for the unutterable tetragrammaton, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>. Instead of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, Christ (it may be supposed) customarily employed the word "Abha," as an almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> of the Supreme Being. When our Lord had occasion to apply the word "Father" as a <span class="accented">common noun</span> to God, whether in addressing him or in speaking of him, we may infer firm the Peshito-Syriac Version of <a href="../../par/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a> that he added another form of the same original noun "<span class="accented">Abj</span>," or "<span class="accented">Obj</span>," instead of or in addition to "Abba." The <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span> of <a href="../../par/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a> may have been used to represent "<span class="accented">Abba</span>;" St. Matthew's <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to represent "<span class="accented">Abj"</span> or "<span class="accented">Obj."</span> The use of "<span class="accented">Abba</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> by believers, probably quite an exceptional <span class="accented">use</span>, was adopted, both as a conscious reminiscence of Christ's utterance in the garden - they, by conjoining themselves thus with their Lord, pleading, as it were, his Name as their warrant for claiming this filial relation with the Most High - and also as an intensely emphatic description of God's fatherhood, by conjoining together the almost <span class="accented">proper name</span> denoting his general fatherhood by which (supposably) Christ was used to designate God, and the <span class="accented">common noun</span> by which Christ's disciples had by him been taught to address him in prayer, and which embodied their sense of his especial fatherhood to those who serve him. The apostle is not to be understood as intimating that the Holy Spirit does actually produce in every heart in which he dwells the definite consciousness of sonship. It is enough for his purpose that the <span class="accented">nisus</span>, the endeavour and tendency of his spiritual operation, is in all cases in that direction, though through slackness on their own part so many Christians fail of conquering for themselves the full possession of their inheritance. But,  however, we need not (he implies)go back to Mosaic ceremonialism to seek <span class="accented">there</span> for our assured sonship. We <span class="accented">have</span> it already here - here, in Christ, and in the indwelling presence of his Spirit.

It here marks the conclusion resulting from the statements of the preceding six verses, viz. of God having sent forth his Son to do away with the Law, subjection to which had marked the nonage of his people, and to raise them to their complete filial position, and of his then sending forth his Spirit into their hearts loudly protesting their sonship. "No longer art thou;" by this individualizing address the apostle strives to awaken each individual believer to the consciousness of the filial position belonging to him in particular. Believe it: in Christ Jesus, thou, thine own very self, art a son! The phrase, "no longer," marks the position of God's servant new, as compared with what it would have been before Christ had wrought his emancipating work and the Holy Spirit had been sent forth as the Spirit of adoption; <span class="accented">then</span> he would have still been a bond-servant; he is not that now. This abrupt singling out one individual as a sample of all the members of a class is an instance of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>). The individual cited by the "thou" is neither a Gentile convert only nor a Jewish believer only; it is any member of God's kingdom. "A son," a member of God's family, an <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>), one free of all law of bondage and in full possession of a <span class="accented">son's</span> privileges; no sinner, now, under his Father's frown; but accepted, beloved, cherished, honoured with his Father's confidence. <span class="cmt_word">And if a son, then</span> <span class="cmt_word">an heir of God through Christ</span> (<span class="greek_word">ei) de\ ui(o/ kai\</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>; <span class="accented">and if a son</span>, <span class="accented">an heir also through God.</span> So <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, "And if children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), heirs also; heirs of God, joint-heirs with Christ." The inheritance here meant is the possession of every blessing which the theocratic kingdom entitles its members to look forward to. And the point of this added clause is that no further qualification is needed for our having a vested right in that inheritance, than that which is supplied by faith in Christ, uniting us to him and making us sharers with him; no such qualification, for example, as the Mosaizing reactionaries insisted upon (see <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>); no observance of ceremonial rites, whether of the Law or of such freaks of heretical" will-worship" as are referred to in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-23.htm">Colossians 2:23</a>. Thy faith in Christ (says in effect the apostle) gives thee now for good and all an assured place in whatever inheritance God designs to give his people. The manuscripts 'rod other authorities for the text present considerable variety in the reading of the last words of this clause. The reading adopted by L. T. Tr., Meyer, Alford, Lightfoot, and Hort and Westcott, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, is that found in the three oldest uncials, and presents a form of expression which was likely so greatly to surprise the copyist as to set him naturally upon the work of revision; whereas that of the Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, would have seemed to him so perfectly natural and easy that he would never have thought of altering it. The words, "<span class="accented">heir</span> through <span class="accented">God</span>," taken in connection with the foregoing context, insist upon the especial appointment of the supreme God himself; his intervention displayed in the most conspicuous manner conceivable, through the incarnated Son and the sent-forth Spirit. The believer is here said to be a son and an heir "through God," in the same sense as St. Paul affirms himself to be an apostle "through Jesus Christ and God the Father," and "through the will of God" (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>); for "of him and through him and unto him are all things," and most manifestedly so, the things composing the economy of grace which the gospel announces (<a href="../../par/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>). The apostle has thus brought back his discourse to the same point which it had reached before in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>. The reader will do well to carefully compare this section of the Epistle (vers. 3-7) with <a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25-8:4</a> and Romans 8:14-17. With great similarity in the forms of expression, the difference of the <span class="accented">apostle's</span> object in the two Epistles is clearly discerned. <span class="accented">There</span> he is discoursing the more prominently of the believer's emancipation <span class="accented">from the controlling power of a sinful nature</span>, which, under the Law, viewed under its moral aspect rather than its ceremonial, was rather fretted into yet more aggravated disobedience than quelled or overpowered. <span class="accented">Here</span> his subject is more prominently the believer's emancipation from the thraldom of the Law's cere-monialism, which in the present Epistle, relative to the troubles in the Galatian Churches, he has more occasion to deal with. Both the one deliverance, however, and the other was necessary for the believer's full consciousness of adoptive sonship; and each was, in fact, involved in the other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-8.htm">Galatians 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;</span>); a strongly adversative conjunction, belonging to the  whole sentence comprised in this and the next verse, which are closely welded together by the particles <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. In contravention of God's work of grace just described, they were renouncing their sonship and making themselves slaves afresh. Then (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>, with its balancing <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, here, as often is the case, unites together sentences not in their main substance strictly adverse to each other, but only in subordinate details contrasted, of which we have an exemplary instance in <a href="../../par/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. In such cases we have often no resource in English but to leave the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> untranslated, as our Authorized Version commonly does; "indeed" or "truly," for example, would be more or less misleading. The truth is, the apostle in these two verses is heaping reproach upon the Galatian Judaizers; first, in this verse, for their former (guilty) ignorance of God and their idolatries, and then, in the next verse, for their slighting that blessed friendship with God which they owed only to his preventing grace. In dealing with Gentile Christians the apostle repeatedly is found referring to their former heathenism, for the purpose of enforcing humility or abashing presumption, as for example in <a href="../../par/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13, 17</a>. In the case of the Galatians his indignation prompts him to use a degree of outspoken severity which he was generally disposed to forbear employing. The "then" is not defined, as English readers might perhaps misconstrue the Authorized Version as intending, by the following clause, "not knowing God," which in that version is "when ye knew not God" - a construction of the words which the use of the participle would hardly warrant; rather the time referred to by the adverb is the time of which he has before been speaking, when God's people were under the pedagogy of the Law. This, though when compared with Christ's liberty a state of bondage, was, however (the apostle feels), a position of high advancement as compared with that of heathen idolaters. These last were "<span class="accented">far</span> off," while the Israelites were "<span class="accented">nigh"</span> (compare the <span class="accented">passages</span> just now referred to). During that time of legal pedagogy the Galatians and their forefathers, all in the apostle's view forming one class, were wallowing in the mire of heathenism. <span class="cmt_word">When ye knew not</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek_word">ou)k ei)do/te Qeo/n</span>); <span class="accented">ye knew not God and</span>, <span class="accented">etc.</span> "Knowing not God" describes the condition of heathens also in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>," Not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles which know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) God;" <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>, "Rendering vengeance to them that know not (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) God." Both of these passages favour the view that the apostle does not in the least intend in the present clause to <span class="accented">excuse</span> the idolatries which he goes on to speak of, but rather to describe a condition of godlessness which, as being positive rather than merely negative, inferred utter pravity and guiltiness. He uses <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> with the participle here, in place of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> in the two <span class="accented">passages c</span>ited from the <span class="accented">Thessalonians</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> intending to state an historical fact viewed absolutely - a sense which is made clear in English by substituting an indicative verb for the participle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye did service unto</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">served</span>; devoted yourselves to. The verb is, perhaps, used here in that milder sense in which it frequently occurs; as in <a href="../../par/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/15-29.htm">Luke 15:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-13.htm">Luke 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-19.htm">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-18.htm">Romans 14:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The Revised Version, however, gives "were in bondage to" in the present instance, but "serve" in the <span class="accented">passages now</span> cited. The aorist, instead of an imperfect, describes the form of religious life which they then led as a whole. <span class="cmt_word">Them which by nature are</span> <span class="cmt_word">no gods</span> (<span class="greek_word">toi  =   fu/sei mh\ ou  =  si</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, which would apparently mean "which arc not gods by nature, but only in your imagination;" like "There be that are called gods," in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-5.htm">1 Corinthians 8:5</a> - Zeus, Apollo, Here, etc., mere figments of imagination (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). The more approved reading suggests rather the idea that the objects they worshipped might not be non-existent, but were certainly not of a Divine nature; "by nature," that is, in the kind of being to which they belong (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; Wisd. 13:1, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The question may be asked - If they were not gods, what then were they? The apostle would probably have answered, "Demons;" for thus he writes to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>): "The things which the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and not to God."

The former, however, is the verb more commonly used in this relation; by St. John, in his First Epistle, where so much is said of  knowing God, exclusively; although in other relations he, both in Epistle and Gospel, uses the two verbs interchangeably. The expression, "to know God," is one of profound pregnancy; denoting nothing less than that divinely imparted intuition of God, that consciousness of his actual being, viewed in his relation to ourselves, which is the result of truly "believing in him." Moreover, as it is knowing a personal Being, between whom and ourselves mutual Action may be looked for, it implies a mutual conversancy between ourselves and him, as the term "acquaintance" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), as used in <a href="../../par/luke/2-44.htm">Luke 2:44</a> and 23. 49, naturally does. So that "having gotten to be known of God" is very nearly equivalent to having been by God brought to be, to speak it reverently, on terms of acquaintanceship with him; and this does indeed seem to be meant in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-3.htm">1 Corinthians 8:3</a>. The Galatian believers had in very truth gotten to know God, if they had learnt to cry out unto him, "Abba, Father." And the remembrance of this happy experience of theirs, which he had, we may suppose, himself witnessed in the early days of their discipleship, prompts him to introduce the correction, "or rather to be known of God." Their having attained such a consciousness of sonship had been, as he writes, ver. 7, "through God;" he it was that had sent forth his Sen that his people might receive the adoption of sons; he that had sent forth his Spirit into their hearts to give them the sense of sonship; he had shown that he knew, recognized them to be his (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>), by gifting them with the blissful prerogative of knowing what he was to them. The correction of "knowing" by "being known" is analogous to that of "apprehend" by "being apprehended" in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>. The pragmatic value of this correcting clause is to make the Galatians feel, not only what a wilful self-debasement it was on their part, but also what a slight put upon the Divine favours shown to them, that they should frowardly repudiate their filial standing to adopt afresh that servile standing out of which he had lifted his people. What was this but a high-handed contravening of God's own work, a frustration of his gospel? And this by them whom only the other day he had rescued from the misery and utter wickedness of idolatry! <span class="cmt_word">How turn ye again</span>; or, back (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">how turn ye back again.</span> An abrupt change from the form of sentence which the foregoing words naturally prepared us for; which might have been such as we should have by simply omitting the "how."

The description is relative rather than absolute. The horn-book, useful enough for the mere child, is of no use whatever to the grown-up lad who has left school. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-18.htm">Hebrews 7:18</a> mention is made of "the weakness and unprofitableness" of the Levitical Law relative to the expiation of sin; which is not precisely the aspect of the Law which is here under view. The word "beggarly" was probably in the writer's mind contrasted with "the unsearchable riches of Christ" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage!</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again</span>? The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is here, differently from ver. 8, contrasted with the condition of a son enjoying his full independence (see ver. 25 and <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). It would be an insufferable constraint and degradation to the full-grown son to be set to con over and repeat the lessons of the infant school. <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, afresh, over again, intensifies <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by adding the notion of making a fresh start from the commencing-point of the course indicated. The application of these words, together especially with the phrase, "turn back again," in the preceding clause, to the case of the Galatian converts from idolatrous heathenism, has suggested to many minds the idea that St. Paul groups the ceremonialism of heathen worship with that of the Mosaic Law. Bishop Lightfoot in particular has here a valuable note, in which, with his usual learning and breadth of view, he shows how the former might in <span class="accented">its ritualistic element</span> have subserved the purpose of a disciplinary training for a better religion. Such a view might be regarded as not altogether out of harmony with the apostle's spirit as evinced in his discourses to the Lyeaonians and the Athenians (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/14-15.htm">Acts 14:15-17</a>; <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/acts/17-22.htm">Acts 17:22-31</a>). But though in his wide sympatheticalness he might, if discoursing with heathens, have sought thus to win them to a better faith, he is hardly just now in a mood for any such sympathetic tolerance. He is much too indignant at the behaviour of these Galatian revolters to allow that <span class="accented">their</span>  former religious ceremonies could have been good enough to be admitted to group with those of the Law of Moses: he has just before adverted to their former heathenism for the very purpose of (so to speak) setting them down - a purpose which would be a good deal defeated by his referring to that cult of theirs as in any respect standing on a level with the cult of the Hebrews. Indeed, it may be doubted whether, at the utmost limit to which he would at any time have allowed himself to go, in the "economy" which he unquestionably was used to employ in dealing with souls, he would, however, have gone so far as to class the divinely appointed ordinances of Israel, the training-school of God's own children, with the ritual of demon-inspired worships. It is much easier to suppose that the apostle identifies the Galatian Churchmen with God's own people, with whom they were now in fact <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, blended in corporal identity with them. God's children had heretofore been in bondage to the A, B, C, of the Law, but were so no longer; if any of those who were now God's children took it in hand to observe that Law, then were they, though not in their individual identity, yet in their corporate identity, turning <span class="accented">back again</span> to the A, B, C, from which they had been emancipated. The former experience of Israel was <span class="accented">their</span> experience, as the "fathers" of Israel were their fathers (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>); which experience they were now setting themselves to renew.

The accumulation of nouns with the reiterated "and," furnishing another example of the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> of St. Paul's style, betokens a scornfully impatient mimesis. These reactionaries were full of festival-observing pedantry - "days," "new moons," "festivals," "holy years," being always on their lips. The meaning of the first three of the nouns is partially suggested by <a href="../../par/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16</a>, "Let no man judge you...  in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a sabbath day (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>);" in which passage, we may observe, there is a similar tone of half-mocking mimesis; where the same ideas are apparently presented, but in a reverse order. Comp. also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-13.htm">2 Chronicles 8:13</a>, Offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles." The "days," then, in the present passage, we may suppose, are the sabbath days, together perhaps with the two fast days every week which the Jewish tradition prescribed (<a href="../../par/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>). The "months" point to the new moons, the observance of which might occasion to these Gentiles considerable scope for discussion in adjusting themselves to the Jewish calendar, different no doubt from the calendar they had been hitherto used to. The "seasons" would be the annual festivals and fasts of the Jews, not only the three prescribed by the Levitical Law, but also certain others added by tradition, as the Feasts of Purim and of Dedication. So far we appear to be on tolerably sure ground. The fourth item, "years," may refer either to the sabbatical year (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-2.htm">Leviticus 25:2-7</a>), which at any rate latterly the Jews had got to pay much attention to (1 Macc. 6:49, 53; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 14:10, 6; also 14:16, 2; Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 5:4); or possibly the jubilee years, one such fiftieth year, it might be, falling about this time due. Bengel ('Gnomon') supposes that a sabbatical year might be being held A.D. , to which date he assigns this Epistle; while Wieseler ('Chronicles Synops.,' p. 204, etc., referred to by Bishop Lightfoot) offers a similar conjecture for the year A.D.  autumn to A.D.  autumn. Very striking is the impatience which the apostle manifests in overhearing as it were the eager discussions occupying the attention of these foolish Galatian Judaizers. Their interest, he perceived, was absorbed by matters which were properly for them things of no concern at all, but which, with ostentatious zeal as such persons do, they were <span class="accented">making</span> their concern. The cause of their doing so lay, we may believe, in the feeling which was growing up in their minds that such like outward observances would of themselves make their life acceptable to God; this general sentiment habiting itself, in the choice of the particular form of outward ceremonies to be adopted, in the observance of the celebrations given by God to his people for the season of their nonage. The principle itself was no doubt repugnant to the apostle's mind, even apart from the Judaizing form which it was  assuming, and which threatened a defection from Christ. Curious regard to such matters he evidently on its own account regards with scorn and impatience. But therewith also the old venerable religion, localized at Jerusalem as its chief seat, would under the impulse of such sentiments be sure to perilously attract their minds away from the "reformation" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-10.htm">Hebrews 9:10</a>) to which it had now been subjected; and they were in danger of losing, nay, had in great degree at least already lost, the zest which they once had fell in embracing the exceeding great and precious gifts which Christ had brought to them. What was there here but the "evil heart of unbelief" spoken of in <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a>, "in departing from the living God," now manifesting himself to his people in his Son? It is this animus characterizing the behaviour of the Galatian Churchmen which marks its essential difference as compared with that observance of "days" and "meats" which in <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. the apostle treats as a matter, relative to which Christians were to live in mutual tolerance. As long as a Christian continued to feel his relation to the Lord Jesus (<a href="../../par/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6-9</a>), it mattered not much if he thought it desirable to observe the Jewish sabbath or to abstain from eating animal food. He might, indeed, make himself thereby chargeable with spiritual unwisdom; the apostle clearly thought he would; but if he still held fast by Christ as the sole and all-sufficing Source to him of righteousness before God and of spiritual life, he was to be received and welcomed as a brother, without being vexed by interference with these foolish tenets of his. It became different when his care for such really indifferent externals took his heart away from a satisfied adherence to the Lord; then his ceremonialism or asceticism became rank and even fatal heresy. And this was what the apostle was fearing on behalf of his once so greatly cherished disciples in Galatia.

This passage in the Thessalonians serves to illustrate the nature of the mischief, which, in the present case, the apostle feared might result. For one thing, there was the hurt, the perhaps fatal hurt, which the Galatian believers might themselves receive from that virtual renouncement of their spiritual inheritance which they now seemed to be foolishly making. But there was also the disappointment which would accrue to himself through the failure of his work among them: "For what," as he wrote to the Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians 2:19, "is our hope, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?" The same anticipated joy he speaks of in writing to the Philippians, as about to accrue to himself from the steadfastness of his converts: "That I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain, neither labour in vain."

"Be as I;" to wit, rejoicing in Christ Jesus as our sole and all-sufficing Righteousness before God, and in that faith letting go all care about rites and ceremonies of the Law of Moses, or indeed ceremonialism of any kind, as if such things mattered at all here, in the business of being well-pleasing to God, whether done or forborne. "Because I on my part am as ye." I, a born Jew, once a zealous worker - out of legal ceremonial righteousness, have put that aside, and have placed myself on the footing of a mere Gentile, content to live like a Gentile (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>), trusting in Christ like as any Gentile has to de who was bare alike of Jewish prerogative and of ceremonial righteousness. This "for" or "because" is an appeal to them for loving sympathy and fellow-working. What was to become of him if <span class="accented">Gentiles</span> withheld from him <span class="accented">their</span> practical sympathy with his religious life? To what other quarter could he look for it? From Jewish sympathy he was an utter outcast. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "brethren, I entreat," comes in here as a breathing forth of intense imploring. And a remarkable instance is here afforded of that abrupt, instantaneous transition in the expression of feeling  which is one great characteristic of St. Paul when writing in one of his more passionate moods. Compare for this the flexure of passionate feeling prevailing through the tenth and three following chapters of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians. Just before, in this chapter, vers. 8-11, the language has been that of stern upbraiding, and, indeed, as if <span class="accented">de haut en bas</span>; <span class="accented">as</span> from one who from the high level of Israelite pre-eminence was addressing those who quite recently were mere outcast heathens. But here he seems suddenly caught and carried away by a flood of passionate emotion of another kind. The remembrance comes to his soul of his own former sorrows, when he "<span class="accented">suffered</span> the <span class="accented">less</span> of all things," as he so pathetically tells the Philippians (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-14</a>); when in the working out of his own salvation, and that of the Gentiles to whom he had been appointed to minister, he had cut himself off from all that he had once prized, and from all the attachments of kindred and party and nation. A terrible rending had it been for him when he had ceased to be a Jew; his <span class="accented">flesh</span> still quivered at the recollection, though his <span class="accented">spirit</span> rejoiced in Christ Jesus. And now this mood of feeling prompts him to cast himself almost as it were at the feet of these Gentile converts, adjuring them not to turn away from him, not to bereave him of <span class="accented">their</span> fellowship and sympathy. <span class="cmt_word">Ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">have not injured me at all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">no wrong have ye done me.</span> This commences a new sentence, which runs on through the next three verses. The apostle is anxious to remove from their minds the apprehension that he was offended with them on the ground of unkindness shown by them towards himself. It was true that he had been writing to them in strong terms of displeasure and indignation; but this was altogether on account of their behaviour towards the gospel, not at all on account of any injury that he had himself to complain cf. He is well aware of the virulent operation of the sentiment expressed by the old maxim, "Odimus quos laesimus;" and is therefore eager and anxious to take its sting out of the mutual relations between himself and them. When the apostle is writing under strong emotion, the connecting links of thought are frequently difficult to discover; and this is the case here. But this seems to be the thread of connection: the Galatian Christians would not be ready to accord him any sympathetic compliance with his entreaty that they would "<span class="accented">be as</span> he <span class="accented">was</span>," if they thought he entertained towards them sentiments of soreness or resentment on personal grounds. There was no reason, he tells them, why they should; they had done him no wrong. There is no reason for supposing that the time of the action referred to in <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is identical with that indicated by the aorists of the two next verses. From the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the first time," in ver. 13, it is clear, as critics have generally felt, that there had been a second visit after that one. If so, a disclaimer of offence taken during the first visit would not have obviated the suspicion of offence taken during a later one. The aorist of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> must, therefore, cover the whole period of intercourse. Perhaps thus: whatever wrong you may suspect me of charging you with, be assured I do not charge you with it; there was no personal affront then offered me. In what follows, it is true, he dwells exclusively upon the enthusiastic demonstration which they made of their personal attachment to him when he first visited them; but though the assertion here made is not to its full extent proved good by the particulars given in vers. 13 and 14, and though the enthusiasm of personal kindness there described must, under the circumstances, have very considerably abated; yet, very supposably, nothing may have occurred since then - nothing, for example, during his second visit - which would show that they now disowned those feelings of love and respect. At all events, he refuses to allow that there had. No personal affront had he to complain of; while, on the other hand, their former intense kindness had laid up as it were a fund of responsive affection and gratitude in his bosom which could not be soon exhausted.

The phrase as so used is equivalent to "We [or, 'you'] do not need to be told," etc.; and with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> is simply a formula introducing such a reminiscence, this conjunction having in such cases head versative force, but being simply the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of transition (meta-batic); equivalent to "now" or "and," or not needing to be represented at all in translation; so that the Authorized Version is perfectly justified in omitting it in the present instance. The phrase may be taken as meaning "And you will well remember." If the apostle had intended to introduce a statement strongly adversative to the last preceding sentence, he would probably have written <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (ch. 2:7) or some such phrase. <span class="cmt_word">How through infirmity of the</span>  <span class="cmt_word">flesh I</span> <span class="cmt_word">preached the gospel unto you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="accented">that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you.</span> "An infirmity of the flesh;" that is, a bodily illness. The noun <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> is used for "illness" in <a href="../../par/john/11-4.htm">John 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-9.htm">Acts 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>. It also denotes a nervous disablement, as <a href="../../par/luke/13-11.htm">Luke 13:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/5-5.htm">John 5:5</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is the common word for "being sick," as <a href="../../par/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/7-10.htm">Luke 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3</a>, etc. It is possible that the apostle meant to say that the Galatians might not unnaturally have thought themselves treated slightingly in that his remaining among them so long was owing to illness and not to his own choice; but that yet, for all that, they had shown themselves most eager in welcoming their involuntary visitor. The words, however, do not require to be thus construed, and in all probability intend no more than to bring back to their remembrance the disorder under which he was then suffering. The illness would seem to have been of a nature to make his personal appearance in some way unsightly, and even repulsive; for the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, spat out, of the next verse suggests even the latter idea. Evidently this disorder, as also the one noted in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, did not disqualify him for ministerial work altogether. He adverts to the circumstance, as making it yet more remarkable and more grateful to his feelings, that, notwithstanding the disagreeable aspect which in some way his disorder presented to those about him, they had cherished his presence among them with so much kindness as they did and also with such reverential respect. How it was that his illness brought about this protracted stay, whether it was that he fell ill while journeying through the country so as to be unable to pursue his way to his ulterior destination, or whether the remarkable healthiness of the climate either first attracted him thither or detained him there for convalescence (see Bishop Lightfoot, 'Galatians,' p. 10, note 2, for the character of the climate at Angora, the ancient Ancyra), it is impossible for us to determine. It is noticeable that St. Chrysostom's comments on the passage appear to show that he considered the apostle to be simply stating the circumstances <span class="accented">under which</span> and not those <span class="accented">in consequence of which</span> he preached the gospel to them; and so also OEcumenius and Theophylact paraphrase <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, suggesting the conjecture that they and St. Chrysostom understood the words as equivalent to "during a period of infirmity of the flesh." But this gives to <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> with an accusative a sense which, to say the least, is not a common one. Is this illness of body to be connected with the affliction, most probably a bodily affliction, mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7, 8</a>, "the stake in the flesh"? This latter affliction has been discussed very fully by Dean Stanley and Meyer on the Corinthians, by Bishop Lightfoot in his commentary on the Galatians, and by Dr. Farrar in his ' Life of St. Paul.' It appears to have first befallen the apostle after the "revelations" accorded to him fourteen years before he wrote his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, which he is supposed to have done in the autumn of A.D. . This would bring us back to about A.D. . The apostle's first visit to Galatia, according to Bishop Lightfoot, p. 22, took place about A.D. . When we consider that no doubt many of those wearing labours and hardships, interspersed with frequent suffering of gross personal outrage, recounted in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>, had been undergone in the eight first of those fourteen years (the stoning at Lystra certainly had), it must seem very precarious to conjecture that the malady here referred to was a recurrence of just that particular disorder experienced eight years before. How many other ailments might not the apostle have been subject to, amid the cruel allotment of suffering and hardship which prevailingly marked his course! It is quite as probable, to say the least, that he may then have been suffering in health or in limb from some assault of personal violence recently undergone. St. Luke gives no particulars whatever of this portion of St. Paul's journey, which is only just mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. The apostle visited Corinth for the first time not many months after this first sojourn in Galatia; and it is interesting to observe that he speaks of his having then ministered to them in "feebleness" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-3.htm">1 Corinthians 2:3</a>), in a manner strongly suggestive of bodily weakness. <span class="cmt_word">At the first</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">the first time</span> - an expression plainly implying that there had been a subsequent sojourn. Respecting this latter visit, all we know is what we have so cursorily stated in <a href="../../par/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>; unless, perchance, we may be able to draw some inferences relating to it from what we read in this Epistle itself. Chronologers are pretty well agreed in placing the commencement of this third apostolical journey about three years after the commencement of the second.

The reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, which is that of the best manuscripts, is now generally accepted in preference to that of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, in which, however, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> stands on a higher footing of evidence than the remaining word <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>. This latter reading may be taken to mean: either, "Of what sort, then, was that gratulation of yours? "that is, what was its value in respect to the depth of conviction on which it was founded? - <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> being <span class="accented">qualis</span>, as <a href="../../par/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-3.htm">Luke 19:3</a>, etc., which would bring us to much the same result as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: or, "How great, then, was that gratulation of yours!" But the "then" (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) comes in lamely; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("at that time") would have been more in place; and, further, it is questionable whether the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> of admiration ever occurs without the wonder taking a tinge of inquiry, as, for example, <a href="../../par/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-21.htm">Luke 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, which would be out of place here. With the more approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>, the apostle asks, "What is, then, become of that gratulation of yourselves?" The "then" recites the fact, implied in the description given of their former behaviour, that they did once felicitate themselves on the apostle's having brought them the gospel. This is more directly brought into view in the words which follow. As the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> means "pronounce happy," as <a href="../../par/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a> and <a href="../../par/james/5-11.htm">James 5:11</a>, the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> denotes "pronouncing one to be happy;" as <a href="../../par/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6, 9</a>. So Clement of Rome ('Ad Cor.,' 50), who weaves the apostle's words into his own sentence with the same meaning. This felicitation must have been pronounced by the Galatians upon themselves, not upon the apostle; the apostle would have spoken of himself on the object of their <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, not of their <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For I bear</span> <span class="cmt_word">you record</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">for I bear you witness</span>; testify on your behalf; the phrase always denoting commendation (<a href="../../par/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-13.htm">Colossians 4:13</a>). Compare "Ye were running well," <a href="../../par/galatians/5-3.htm">Galatians 5:3</a>.

The omission of the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;</span>, which is rejected by recent editors, perhaps intimates the certainty and readiness with which they would have done it; but the particle occurs very sparingly in the New Testament as compared with classical Greek. There seems something strange in the specification of this particular form of evidencing zealous attachment. If there had otherwise appeared any question of making gifts, the apostle might have been construed to mean, "Ye were ready to give me anything, your very eyes even;" but this is not the case. Possibly the particular mention of "the Churches of Galatia" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> may have been occasioned by their having shown an especial readiness, even at the apostle's second sojourn among  them, to take part in the collection referred to; or by their having been the first Churches he came to in that particular tour, the directions which he gave to them being given also to all the Churches he went on to visit; but on this point see Introd. p. 16. The tone of <a href="../../par/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6-10</a> does not betoken especial open-handedness on their part, unless, perhaps, the words, "let us not grow weary," hint at a liberality once displayed but now declined from. On the whole, this specification of "eyes" seems rather to point to there having been something amiss with the apostle's own eyes, either from ophthalmia or as the effect of personal outrage perpetrated upon him. It is especially deserving of notice how the apostle, in the two clauses of this verse, links together their joy in their newly found Christian blessedness with their grateful love to himself; the latter fact is adduced as proof of the former. Their gospel happiness, he feels, was indissolubly woven in with their attachment to him: if they let go their joy in Christ Jesus, as, apart from any qualification to be acquired by observances of the Law of Moses, their all-sufficient righteousness, they must also of necessity become estranged from him, who was nothing if not the exponent and herald to them of that happiness. This consideration is of great moment for the right understanding of the next verse.

This is a wailing remonstrance against an apprehended incipient state of alienation. "So then," <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (see note on ver. 7), occurs repeatedly before an imperative; as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>; here only before a question. Its consecutive import here lies in the essential identification between their attachment to St. Paul and their allegiance to the pure gospel. If they forsook the gospel, their heart was gone from <span class="accented">him.</span> Naturally also their incipient defection from the truth was accompanied by a jealousy on their part hew he would regard them, and by a preparedness to listen to those who spoke of him, as Judaizers everywhere did, with disparagement and dislike. No doubt the accounts which had just reached him of the symptoms showing themselves among them of defection from the gospel, and which prompted the immediate despatch of this Epistle, had informed him also of symptoms of a commencing aversation from himself. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> is similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in the Textus Receptus of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>, which is perfectly good Greek, even though the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must be removed from the text as not genuine.

As it stands, "<span class="accented">dealing</span> with you according to truth" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) expresses the apostle's continuous declaration of the gospel, and his never-flinching ins]stance upon the mortal danger of defection from it (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); and "I am become your enemy" points to the result now manifesting itself from this steadfast attitude of his, in consequence of their <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of meriting his disapproval. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> occurs only once in the Septuagint - in <a href="../../par/genesis/42-16.htm">Genesis 42:16</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, "Whether there be any truth in you" (Authorized Version and Hebrew); and once besides in the New Testament - in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x1fc3;</span>, where the verb denotes, apparently, not merely being truthful in speech, but the whole habit of addiction both to uprightness and to God's known truth; for we can hardly leave out of our view this latter idea, when we consider how frequently the apostle designates the gospel by the term "the truth" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-2.htm">2 Corinthians 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-7.htm">2 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-8.htm">2 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:10, 12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). "Enemy" is either one regarded as adopting a hostile position to them, or one viewed with hostile feeling by them, which latter is its sense in <a href="../../par/romans/11-28.htm">Romans 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>. The above exposition of the import of this verse is confirmed by the consideration that the Epistle affords no trace of the apostle's relations with the Galatian converts having been other than mutually friendly at even his second visit to them. This fact is implied in ver. 12, and <a href="../../par/galatians/1-9.htm">Galatians 1:9</a> furnishes no evidence to the contrary; for those warnings may have been uttered in his first visit as well as in his second, without occasioning or being occasioned by any want of mutual confidence. This view of their mutual relations is confirmed likewise by the feelings of indignant astonishment with which evidently the apostle took up his pen to address them in this letter: the tidings which had just reached him had been a painful surprise to him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-17.htm">Galatians 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">They zealously affect you, <i>but</i> not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They zealously affect you, but</span> <span class="cmt_word">not well</span> (<span class="greek_word">zhlou  =  sin u(ma  =   ou) kalw  =  </span>); <span class="accented">they admire you in no good way.</span> Of the several  senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, those of "envy," "emulate," "strive after," are plainly unsuitable in this verse and the one which follows. So also are the senses "to be zealous on one's behalf, to be jealous of one," which in Hellenistic usage crept into it, apparently from its having been in other senses adopted to represent the Hebrew verb <span class="accented">qinne</span>, and borrowing these from this Hebrew verb. The only phase of its meaning which suits the present passage is that which it perhaps by far the most frequently presents in ordinary Greek, though not so commonly in the Septuagint and in the New Testa ment, namely, "to admire," "deem and pronounce highly fortunate and blessed." When used in this sense, it has properly for its object a person; but with a suitable qualification of meaning it may have for its object something inanimate. Very often is the accusative of the person accompanied with the genitive of the ground of gratulation, as Aristophanes, 'Ach.,' 972, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>  "I congratulate, admire, you for your cleverness;" see also 'Equit.,' 834; 'Thes moph.,' 175; 'Vesp.,' 1450; but not always; thus Demosthenes, 'Fals. Legat.,' p. 424, "(<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) they admire and congratulate and would each one be himself the like;" 'Adv. Lept.,' p. 500 (respecting public funeral orations), "This is the custom of men admiring (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) virtue, not of men looking grudgingly upon those who on its account are being honoured;" Xenophon, 'Mere.,' 2:1,19. "Thinking highly of themselves, and praised and admired (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">by</span> others;" Josephus, 'C. Ap.,' 1:25, "(<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) admired by many." It thus seems to be often just equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, with the sense of which latter verb it is brought into close neighbourhood in Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188, "' Blessed (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>), Strepsiades, are you, both for being so wise yourself and for having such a son as you have,' - thus will my friends and fellow-wardsmen say, in admiration of me (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>)." Probably this is the sense in which the apostle uses the verb in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span>, "I rejoice in your felicity with an infinite joy;" referring to the intense admiration which he felt of their present felicity, in their having been betrothed a chaste maiden to Christ; not till the next verse introducing the mention of his fear lest this paradisaical happiness might be darkened by the wiles of Satan. It is in a modified shade of the same sense that the word is employee  - where it is rendered "covet earnestly" in our Authorized Version in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-31.htm">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1, 39</a>. In the passage now. before us, then, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "they admire you," that is, they tell you so. They were expressing strong admiration of the high Christian character and eminent gifts of these simple-minded believers; the charisms which had been bestowed upon them (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>); their virtues, in contrast especially with their heathen neighbours; their spiritual enlightenment. No doubt all this was said with the view of courting their favour; but <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> can hardly itself mean "court favour," and no instance of its occurring in this sense has been adduced; and this rendering of the verb breaks down utterly in ver. 18. The persons referred to must, of course, be understood as those who were busy in instilling at once Judaizing sentiments and also feelings of antipathy to the apostle himself, as if he were their enemy (ver. 16). The Epistle furnishes no indication whatever that these persons were strangers coming among them from without, answering, for example, to those spoken of in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a> as disturbing the Antiochian Church. It is quite supposable that the warning which, not long after the writing of this Epistle, the apostle addressed to the Ephesian elders at Miletus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29, 30</a>), when putting them on their guard against those who "from among their own selves should rise up speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them," was founded in part upon this experience of his in the Galatian Churches. Galatian Churchmen it may well have been, and no other, who now (as the apostle had just been apprised) were employing that <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, that "kind suave speech" and that "speech of compliment and laudation," which in <a href="../../par/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a> he describes as a favourite device of this class of deceivers, to win the ear of their unwary brethren. "In no good way;" for they did it insincerely and with the purpose of drawing them <span class="accented">into</span> courses which, though these men themselves knew it not, were nevertheless fraught with ruin to their spiritual welfare. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, they would</span> <span class="cmt_word">exclude you;</span> or, us (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">nay<span class="cmt_word"></span>,</span> <span class="accented">rather</span>, <span class="accented">to shut you out is their wish.</span> The reading "us," noticed in the margin of the Authorized Version, is probably a merely conjectural emendation made in the Greek text by Beza, wholly unsupported by manuscript authority. The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is adversative to the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, the secondary thought of the preceding clause, in the same way as the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a> is adversative to the secondary negative clauses of ver. 6. The verb "shut out," with no determinative qualification annexed, must have it supplied from the unexpressed ground for the "admiration" denoted by the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The high eminence of spiritual condition and happiness on the possession of which these men were congratulating their brethren, they would be certainly excluded from if they listened to <span class="accented">them.</span> Compare the phrase, "who are unsettling you," driving you out  of house and home, in ch. 5:12, where see note. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might affect them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">that ye may admire themselves.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> makes it emphatic. We may paraphrase thus: that, being detached from regard to my teaching, and made to feel a certain grave deficiency on your own part in respect to acceptableness with God, ye may be led to look up as disciples to these kind-hearted sympathetic advisers for instruction and guidance. The construction of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, which in ordinary Greek is the present <span class="accented">indicative</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> being the form for the present <span class="accented">subjunctive</span>, is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>. When it is considered how punctually St. Paul is wont to comply with the syntactical rule with reference to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, and that these two remarkable deflections therefrom are connected with contract forms of verbs in -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, Ruckert's suggestion seems to be perfectly reasonable, that the solecism lies, not in the syntactical construction, but in the grammatical in flexion, contracting -<span class="greek">&#x1f79;&#x3b7;</span> into -<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of into-<span class="greek">&#x1ff6;</span>. This form of contraction may have been a provincialism of Tarsus, or it may have been an idiotism of St. Paul himself. Other expedients of explanation which have been proposed are intolerably harsh and improbable.

In signification, this <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be admired, is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to be congratulated, and was illustrated in the first note on ver. 17, especially by the reference to Aristophanes, 'Nubes,' 1188. <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "to be objects of admiration when I am present with you," is manifestly a recital of the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the gratulation of yourselves," of ver. 15. The vivid remembrance of the simple-hearted joy and frank sympathy with each other's happiness of those days comes back to the apostle's mind with fresh force, after his brief mention and rebuke of the false-hearted gratulations and compliments by which they were now in danger of being ensnared. With a gentle reprehension of their levity, in that they were now bartering that former well-founded happiness for this later poor gratification of being recipients of mere false flattery, he yearns to bring them back to what they were so senselessly casting away, and that they should hold it fast, a stable joy, whether he was with them or not. This would be the case if "Christ were truly formed in them." The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;</span>, "in what is good," is similar to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/7-4.htm">John 7:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>). The sphere in which this admiring felicitation acts must be "what is good;" here that highest good which these Galatians were in danger of losing, if, indeed, they possessed it - being, and knowing themselves to be, sons of God. It is a doubtful point whether ver. 19 should be conjoined with this present verse, with a colon between vers. 19 and 20, and a comma only at the end of ver. 18; or whether the sentences should be separated as they appear in our Authorized Version. But at all events, the earnest, anxious, tender affectionateness which, as it were, wrings the apostle's heart in writing ver. 19, is to be felt already working in his soul in the writing of this eighteenth verse. The sense above given to the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, though disallowed by Alford and Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot, appears to be that recognized by the Greek commentators Chrysostom and Theophylact.

The objection to the latter arrangement, presented by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> at the commencement of ver. 20, is thought by many to be obviated by a number of instances which have been alleged in which this conjunction is used with a sentence following a vocative compellation (see Alford, Ellicott). But such cases appear marked by a tone of vivacity and surprise which is not present here. On the other hand, the tone of loving affectionate anxiety breathing in this verse links it more closely with the preceding than with the following one, in which such pathos is no longer discernible, but is replaced by a deliberative attitude of mind. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> occurs as a compellation here only in St. Paul's writings, though repeatedly in St. John's Epistle and once in his Gospel (<a href="../../par/john/13-33.htm">John 13:33</a>), where it appears as used by our Lord in an access of deeply moved affectionate-ness. St. Paul addresses Timothy as "his child" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>, not only as a term of endearment, but as  denoting also his having been spiritually begotten by him (comp. <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>). Here the like sense attaches to the word, as is clear from the following clause, "of whom I am again in travail;" but the diminutive form of the noun, agreeing well with the notion of a child at its birth, combines in this case apparently a tender allusion also to the extremely immature character of their Christian discipleship .(compare "babes (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) in Christ," <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>) - so immature, in fact, that the apostle is travailing of them afresh, as if not yet born at all. This particular shade of meaning, however, must be sacrificed, if we accept the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "my children," which is highly authenticated. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> cannot be understood as pointing to gestation merely; it can only denote the pangs of parturition. The apostle by this figure describes himself as at this hour in an anguish of desire to bring the souls of his converts both to a complete <span class="accented">state</span> of sonship in Christ Jesus, and to a complete <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of that state - now at length bring them thereto, though that former travail had seemingly been in vain. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a> and <a href="../../par/philemon/1-10.htm">Philemon 1:10</a> he refers to himself as a spiritual <span class="accented">father</span> of his converts, and this too with touching pathos. Great is the pathos too of his reference to himself as, in his fostering care of his Thessalonian converts, like a tender "nursing mother cherishing her own children," and also as of a "father" of them (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7, 11</a>). But neither of those passages equals the present in the expression of intense, even anguished, longing to effect, if only he might be able to effect it, a real transformation in the spiritual character of these Galatian converts. "Until" - I cannot rest till then! - "Christ be formed in you." The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, form, occurs only here in the New Testament in its uncompounded shape. A passage is cited from 'Const. Apost.,' 4:7, in which it occurs in the phrase, "formed man in the womb." In the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/exodus/21-22.htm">Exodus 21:22</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the unborn infant. It certainly seems as if the apostle used the word as one belonging to the same region of thought as the <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span>, but, with the like bold and plastic touch as elsewhere characterizes his use of imagery, refusing to be tied to thorough-going consisteney in its application. Compare for example <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-2.htm">2 Corinthians 3:2</a>. When the hour of <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3b4;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is come, the period of the" formation" of the babe has expired. Further, as showing the freedom of the writer's use of imagery, the easiest way of taking <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to suppose that "Christ" is here viewed as "<span class="accented">within"</span> them, and not as a likeness to which they are to be conformed: camp. <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:22, "Christ liveth in me;" and <a href="../../par/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, where the "mystery" of the gospel is summed up in the words, "Christ in you the hope of glory." He cannot rest, he means, till the image, thought, of Christ as the Object of their sole and absolute trust, as the complete ground of their acceptance with God and their sonship, shall be perfectly and abidingly formed in their hearts. The hour in which a perfectly formed "Christ," that fair' Divine Child of joy and hope, has come to be there, in their hearts, will be the hour in which the apostle's travailing pangs have issued in their birth. No doubt the apostle is writing to persons baptized into Christ and thus clothed with Christ (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>); persons, in the language of the Church, "born again." But however straitly <span class="accented">we</span> choose to be restrained in the use of such images, solidifying into rigid dogma similitudes used for such passing illustration as the occasion of the moment requires, the sacred writers themselves recognize no such restriction. As Chrysostom observes in his 'Commentary,' the apostle's language in effect is, "Ye need a fresh new-birth, a fresh remoulding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." Baptized into Christ as those Galatians were, they were, however, in his view no true sons of God, until Christ had been really formed in their hearts.

Bishop Lightfoot writes, "<span class="accented">But</span>, speaking of my presence, <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">would I had been present</span>," etc. But this explanation is not necessary. The imperfect verb <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, like the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/acts/25-22.htm">Acts 25:22</a> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, denotes a movement as it were which had just been stirring in the mind, but which for good reasons is now withdrawn: "I could almost wish -  but long distance and pressure of other duties make it impossible." Thus much in explanation of the withdrawal of the wish. The wish itself was occasioned by the feeling that the yearning desire of his soul might perhaps be more likely to be achieved if, by being on the spot, he were enabled to adapt his treatment to a more distinct consciousness of the circumstances than he can possibly now have. "To be present with you;" the very words are repeated from ver. 18. It was well both with you and with me when I was with you: would that I could be with van now I (On <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,," this very hour," see note on ch. 1:9.) <span class="cmt_word">And to change my voice</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The tense of the infinitive  <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> hardly allows us to take the word as meaning "from moment to moment according to the rapidly varying emergencies." This would have been expressed rather by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. The question then arises - Change: from what to what? to which a great variety of answers have been proposed. The clue is probably supplied in the words, "be present with you this very hour." This <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, contrasting as it does the very present with the former occasions on which the apostle had been with them, suggests that he meant that the tone of his utterance would need to be different if amongst them just now from what it had then been. Then, it was the simple, un-anxious, joyous, exposition of the blessed gospel, untrammelled by fear of being misunderstood; such a way of speaking as one would be naturally drawn on to pursue who found himself addressing those whom he could confide in, and who were disposed frankly and lovingly, with an honest and good heart, to drink in from his lips the simple faith. Perhaps he might now find it necessary to replace that mode of utterance by guarded words, by stern reasoning, by the refuting of wilful misconceptions, by exposing and abashing cavil and objection. <span class="cmt_word">For I stand in doubt of you</span>; or, I <span class="accented">am perplexed for you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">I</span> <span class="accented">am perplexed about you.</span> Compare <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "I am in good courage concerning you" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-16.htm">2 Corinthians 7:16</a>). As "<span class="accented">in"</span> the Corinthians the apostle found ground for good courage, so "in" the Galatians he found ground for perplexity. This explains his wishing that he were with them. He would in that case be less unable to clearly understand their state of mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21</a></div><div class="verse">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the Law</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). After the outburst of affectionate earnestness expressed in the last four verses, the apostle seems to have paused, reflecting in what way he could the most effectually convince these Galatian legalists of their error. At length, a consideration occurs to him, which he impetuously so to speak hastens to abruptly sot before them. He has before (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>) shown to the Galatian believers that they were "Abraham's seed." He now means to show that, as children of Abraham through faith in Christ, they stood on a far higher footing than the children of the Sinai covenant did - a position which, by subjecting themselves afresh to the Law, they would forego. The verb "desire" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), as here introduced, intimates that this aspiration of theirs was a mere freak of self-will, there being nothing in the circumstances to prompt it. So in ver. 9, "Ye desire to be in bondage." In consequence of there being no article with <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, some would render <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> "under Law," that is, Law viewed <span class="accented">in</span> g<span class="accented">enere</span>, as in <a href="../../par/romans/4-15.htm">Romans 4:15</a>. But the whole scope of the Epistle resists this view. The apostle's contention with the Galatian perverters of the truth is not concerning Christians being subject to Law absolutely, but concerning their being subject to a Law of outward ceremonial observance; that is, to the Law of Moses; for there was no other system of positive ordinances by which, as of Divine authority, they could imagine themselves to be bound. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used without the article, like other <span class="accented">monadic</span> nouns with an understood specific reference (for examples, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as it is also <a href="../../par/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/3-31.htm">Romans 3:31</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-13.htm">Romans 4:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-13.htm">Romans 5:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-21.htm">Galatians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not hear the Law?</span> (<span class="greek_word">to\n no/mon</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>;); <span class="accented">to that Law give ye no heed</span>?

There is no reason for attributing to the verb such a sense of listening to an <span class="accented">oral</span> utterance as should warrant us in supposing, that the apostle is thinking in particular of the Galatian Christians as in the habit of "hearing" the Pentateuch and ether Old Testament Scriptures read, whether in Jewish synagogues (cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-14.htm">2 Corinthians 3:14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>) or in Christian assemblages. That such Scriptures in the Septuagint Version were customarily read aloud when Christians assembled for united worship, especially in the absence or dearth of other inspired writings, is more than probable: we know from Justin Martyr ('Apol.,' 1. p. 83) that such was the custom from Sunday to Sunday in his days, when there were <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> also available for such use. Moreover, the existence of such a custom helps us to understand how it was that the apostle could here, as in <a href="../../par/romans/7-1.htm">Romans 7:1</a>, presuppose with Christian believers an acquaintance with the contents of the Pentateuch. But we require more here than the thought, "Are ye not wont to hear the Law read?" It is rather an acquaintance with its contents, and taking due account of them, that he demands of his readers. Some uncial manuscripts have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, read, instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. This reading of the text would only imply, not without a touch of sarcasm, the sense which the more accredited reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may be understood as directly denoting. The use of the word "Law" to denote at once the system of  Mosaic legislation and the historical record in which it is embedded, is remarkable. The Jews were accustomed to designate the Pentateuch by this term (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>); and whoever would fain subject themselves to the positive enactments of the Mosaic Law as possessing Divine authority, would of course feel themselves bound also to accept the teaching of the historical record as clothed with the like authority. The apostle himself also accepted both as alike coming from God; only he required that the Divine purpose in both should be clearly understood and be suitably complied with.

Attention has been drawn to other sons born of Keturah (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-1.htm">Genesis 25:1, 2</a>), who both in ancient and in modern days (see Windisch-mann) have been very plausibly interpreted as analogously pointing forward allegorically to those heretical bodies, now vanished, which threatened such danger to the Church in the first centuries. But the apostle's concern here is exclusively with the posture of affairs subsisting at the time of Hagar's and Ishmael's expulsion from the patriarch's family, quoted in ver. 30 from <a href="../../par/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21</a>. Even if he had seen fit by allegorical exposition to apply Scripture to those dire forms of utterly perverted Christianity, which he certainly did look forward to as about to arise, it is very questionable whether he would have conceded to them so venerable a parentage as having Abraham for their forefather. Mosaism in its place was a thing of Divine origin, even as Christianity itself was, both of them "covenants" of God; not so the monstrous forms of Gnostic and Manichean teaching which horrified the primitive Church. In fact, typology, that is to say, the interpretation of Old Testament Scripture as bearing a <span class="accented">designed</span> allegorical sense, requires very cautious handling. The tracing of analogies is an interesting and pleasing exercise of theological ingenuity; but it is one thing to trace a parallelism, and a quite different thing to detect a latent predictive sense intended by the Holy Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">The one by a bondmaid</span> (<span class="greek_word">e%na e)k th  =   paidi/skh</span>); <span class="accented">one by the handmaid</span>; the expression pointing to the individual mother known from the sacred history. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> in classical Greek means a girl either slave or free. In the Septuagint it is generally a slave (not, however, in <a href="../../par/ruth/4-12.htm">Ruth 4:12</a>, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">na'arah</span>); in the New Testament it is always a maidservant. St. Paul borrows the word from the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a>. and 21, where it renders the Hebrew <span class="accented">shiphehah.</span> Hagar was the personal property of Sarah. <span class="cmt_word">The other by a freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and one by the freewoman.</span> The word "freewoman" is never applied to Sarah in the story in Genesis; not even in the passage freely quoted in ver. 30; but it was an obviously true description, and with perfect fairness introduced in antithesis to Hagar.

The apostle has evidently in his eye the analogy presented by the natural birth of the Jewish descendants from Abraham, as contrasted with the birth of Abraham's spiritual seed through faith in the promises of the gospel. This point, however, he is content with merely, in vers. 28, 29, glancing at. His main point is the condition of both mother and child in each case, as being either both free or both in bondage. It is not clear whether the apostle by <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> meant "born" or "begotten," the verb being used in both senses: but neither is it material. The perfect tense of the verb either supposes us to be as it were present at the time of Ishmael's expulsion, in which case it would mean, "hath been born," or is used with reference to the record in the history, meaning in this case "appears in the story as having been born." So the perfect tense is used also in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-6.htm">Hebrews 7:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, and <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-18.htm">Hebrews 10:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. "According to the flesh" does not precisely mean "in the common course of torture;" the word "flesh" rather contrasts the present visible sphere of human life with the invisible spiritual world, in much the same way as "flesh" is so often contrasted with "spirit." Ishmael was born "after the flesh," <span class="accented">because</span> he was born in the common course of nature; Isaac was born (ver. 28) "after the Spirit," because his birth was connected with the invisible spiritual world "through the promise," which on the one A hand was given by God the great Sovereign of the spiritual world, and on the other was laid hold of and made effectual in that same world of spiritual action by Abraham's and Sarah's faith.

This promise was the <span class="accented">means</span> of Isaac's being born, calling forth as it did an acting of faith in God, both in Abraham (<a href="../../par/romans/4-17.htm">Romans 4:17-21</a>), and likewise in Sarah (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>), in consideration of which the Almighty beyond the course of nature gave them this child.

The apostle, perhaps, intimates that the particulars just recited by him belong to a class of objects distinguished among other objects presented to us in the Old Testament by having a further sense than the literal historical one; the literal historical sense, however, by no means being thereby superseded. Comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, "Now these things happened unto them (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) as figures [or, 'by way of figure ']."

Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot furnish passages illustrative of both meanings, particularly of the second; and the latter adds the observation that it is possible that the apostle uses the verb here in the sense of being allegorically expounded, "referring to some recognized mode of interpretation." St. Paul did at times refer to authority extrinsical to his own (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-16.htm">1 Corinthians 11:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-11.htm">1 Corinthians 15:11</a>). But whichever of the two possible senses of the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> was the one here intended by the apostle, there is no improbability in the supposition that not now for the first time was the narrative of Hagar and Ishmael thus applied: it is quite supposable, for instance, that it had been so applied at Antioch, in the animated discussions in which Paul, Barnabas, and Silas encountered the Judaists in that Church. At all events, it is not merely supposable, but in a high degree probable, that at least <span class="accented">some</span> of the historical personages, institutions, and events of the Old Testament Scriptures were wont to be allegorically treated by leaders of Christian thought of the highest authority. We cannot acquiesce in the position adopted by some critics, that such allegorizing is to be relegated to the region of mere Jewish rabbinism, now to be regarded as exploded. And we need not here insist upon the consideration that a rabbinical origin would constitute no valid objection to our acceptance of such allegorizing treatment of Scripture, because that the results of rabbinical exegesis and of rabbinical investigations in theology were in many cases of the highest value - a fact which those who are acquainted, for example, with Professor Reuss's 'Histoire de la Theologie Cbretienne' will not be disposed to question. For we resist the attempt to thrust us back upon the schools of the rabbins, as if it were from them only that St. Paul derived this allegorical method of Scripture exposition. Those schools may have made him acquainted with it, it is true; but altogether independently of rabbinical instruction, the leading teachers of the Church, even before Paul's conversion, "unlearned men," <span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, as the rabbinists regarded them, had, as we cannot doubt, learnt thus to apply Scripture in the school of Jesus. Christ himself, not only before his passion, but also, and we may believe with greater definiteness and particularity, after his resurrection (<a href="../../par/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>), had imparted to his apostles and other disciples <span class="accented">some</span> expositions of historical facts of the Old Testament, which must have been of this description, and which would suggest the legitimate application of the same method in other analogous instances. And those men were not only disciples, pupils of Jesus, but were likewise especial, though not the exclusive, organs of the Holy Spirit's teaching in the Church (<a href="../../par/john/16-12.htm">John 16:12-15</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Particular allegorical expositions, therefore, received amongst those apostles and prophets of Christ, came clothed with the highest authority, emanating as they well might have done from Christ's own oral teaching, or from an immediate special leading of his Spirit. And, further, we feel ourselves entitled to believe that the supreme Revealer of spiritual truth to mankind might well think fit to appoint, not only words or ceremonial institutions as means of imparting religious instruction or of prophetical indication, but historical incidents as well; not merely so ordering the manner in which his inspired organs framed their <span class="accented">narratives</span> of certain occurrences as to make those narratives  prophetical, but also in his disposal of human affairs so ordering the occurrences themselves as that <span class="accented">they</span> should be prophetical; furnishing (so to speak) <span class="accented">tableaux vivants</span>, in which the faith of his servants should read, ff not spiritual facts which were as yet future, at least spiritual facts after they had come to <span class="accented">pass</span>, the prophetical adumbration of which, now recognized by them, would serve to confirm their belief in them and their comprehension of them. The fact that Christ repeatedly and most pointedly referred to the strange experiences of Jonah as prophetical of his own passion and resurrection proves to a certainty that events might be predictive as well as utterances of prophets. Our Lord's use of the story of the brazen serpent, of the gift of manna, and of the Passover (<a href="../../par/luke/22-16.htm">Luke 22:16</a>) points in the same direction. We have also apostolical guidance in construing the Passover, the Exodus, the story of Melehiscdec, Abraham's offering up of his son, the yearly Fast of the Atonement, as legitimately subject to similar treatment. Since the old economy with its histories and its ordinances originated from the same Divine Author as the new, it is no unreasonable belief that in the things of preparatory dispensations he had set foreshadowings, and in no scant number, of those great things in the spiritual economy which from "eternal ages" had been his thoughts towards us, and in which the whole progress of human history was to find its consummation. In the apostle's discussion of his subject there are in part distinctly specified, in part merely indicated, a great variety of contrasts; these the reader will find presented by Bengel in his 'Gnomon' in a tabulated form with great distinctness. For these are the two covenants; or, <span class="accented">testaments</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for these women are two covenants.</span> The Textus Receptus has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. but the article is expunged by all recent editors. What the apostle means is this: the circumstance that Abraham had two wives pointed to the fact that there were to be, not one covenant only, but two. He has previously (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15, 17</a>) spoken of "<span class="accented">the</span> promise" as a covenant; while also this term was already a familiar designation of the economy which God appointed to the natural "seed of Abraham." Compare also Jeremiah's mention of these two "<span class="accented">covenants"</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>).

This covenant, with its children, being wrapped in an element of slavery, is kindred in character with Hagar and her offspring. It is objected that Ishmael was not, in fact, a slave. But as Hagar does not appear to have been a recognized concubine of Abraham, in the same way as Bilhah and Zilpah were concubines of Jacob, but still continued to be Sarah's handmaid ("thy maid," <a href="../../par/genesis/16-6.htm">Genesis 16:6</a>), her child was, of course, born into the same condition. With Sarah's consent, it is true, Abraham might, if he had thought fit, have <span class="accented">adopted</span> him as a child of his own; but this does not appear to have been done.

This clause has been the subject of much conflicting opinion. The reading of the Greek text is itself much debated, and in the original authorities (manuscripts, versions, and Fathers) it appears in a great variety of forms. A detailed discussion of the latter point would be out of place here; and for the premisses from which the critical judgment is to be drawn, the reader is referred to Alford, and to a detached note which Bishop Lightfoot adds in his ' Commentary,' at the end of this fourth chapter. Only the main result needs to be stated. There are two forms of the text, between which the choice lies. One is that of the  Textus Receptus, namely, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>," For the <span class="accented">word</span> Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia." This is maintained by Meyer, Alford, Ellicott, and San-day. The other, omitting the word <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, runs thus: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">For</span> Sinai is a mountain in Arabia." This is accepted by Bentley, Lachmann, Tregelles, Tischendorf (latterly), Bengel, De Wette, Windischmann, Howson, and Lightfoot. In respect to the original authorities, there is not generally thought to exist any <span class="accented">great</span> preponderance in the evidence for either the retention or the omission of the word "<span class="accented">Hagar."</span> The decision, therefore, depends chiefly upon a comparison of the internal probabilities. In order to this, we must gain as clear a view as we can of the meaning of the above two readings. That of the Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, according to Chrysostom, as well as modern critics, means this: "For the word Hagar is [represents] in Arabia Mount Sinai." Chrysostom remarks, "<span class="accented">Hagar</span> is the word for Mount Sinai in the language of that country; "and again, "That mountain where the old covenant was delivered, hath a name in common with the bondwoman." Critics make reference to <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, "I went away into Arabia." "It is difficult," <span class="accented">says</span> Dean Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 50." to resist the thought that he [St. Paul] too may have stood upon the rocks of Sinai, and heard from Arab lips the often-repeated <span class="accented">Ha jar</span>, rock, suggesting the double meaning to which the text alludes." But the Arabic word for "rock" <span class="accented">is chajar</span>, differing from <span class="accented">Hajar</span>, the Arabic form of the bondwoman's name, by having <span class="accented">eheth</span> for its initial letter instead of <span class="accented">he.</span> Further, the Arabs would have used the word only as a common noun, "<span class="accented">rock</span>," and not as a proper noun, the <span class="accented">name</span> of the mountain. St. Paul could not have <span class="accented">mistaken</span> the one for the other. There is no evidence at all to substantiate Chrysostom's assertion that the Arabs did name the mountain Hagar; he apparently thought so only because the apostle seemed to him to affirm it. See Lightfoot further on this point. Moreover, the sentence, "The word Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia," is not what St. Paul would have written to express this idea; either, instead of "in Arabia" he would have written "in the language of the country;" or else, "for the Mount Sinai is called Hagar in Arabia." Another objection to this reading is the order in which the words <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> stand. Elsewhere where the words are conjoined the order is, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span>. The passages are these: <a href="../../par/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18, 20</a>; 24:26; 31:18; 34:2; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-13.htm">Nehemiah 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/7-30.htm">Acts 7:30</a>. The reversal of the order here indicates that <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> is the subject, and <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> belongs to the predicate; that is, that <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span> must be expunged from the text, and that we adopt the other reading, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>, "For Sinai is a mountain in Arabia," the well-known land of Hagar and her descendants; <a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-18.htm">Genesis 25:18</a> (see Mr. Peele's articles on "Hagar" and "Shur" in the 'Dictionary of the Bible'). The article is prefixed to <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;</span> as having been already just mentioned; as if it were "for this Sina is," etc. The purpose of the clause, however it be read, is plainly to make more colourable the allegorical exposition; it explains why the locality of the giving of the Law has been referred to in the words, "one, from Mount Sinai" - a local specification quite alien to the apostle's usual manner in referring to the old covenant, and only had recourse to here for this particular object. And answereth to (or, <span class="accented">is</span> <span class="accented">in the same rank with</span>) Jerusalem which now is (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f39;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;</span>); <span class="accented">and standeth in the same class</span> (literally, <span class="accented">in the same column</span>) <span class="accented">with the Jerusalem that now is.</span> The use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> the reader will find amply illustrated in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon.' In the military language of Greece, illustrated out of Polybius, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing in the same <span class="accented">file</span> or column, one behind another (as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> were those standing side by side in the same <span class="accented">rank</span>). Hence, as if tabulated on a board, ideas belonging to the same class, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as if placed in a vertical line in column, and so were called <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>: whilst ideas belonging to a class contrasted with the former, both types and antitypes, were conceived of as placed horizontally opposite to the former in another column; the two sets of contrasted ideas being <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;</span> to each other. Thus in the present instance we have two columns - <p>Hagar, slave mother; &#8212; Sarah, freewoman. <p>Ishmael, slave child; &#8212; Believers, free children. <p>Covenant from Sinai; &#8212; Promise. <p>Jerusalem that now is; etc. &#8212; Jerusalem that is above; etc. (Compare Erasmus's note in Peele's 'Synopsis.') It is not improbable, as Bishop Lightfoot observes, that St. Paul is alluding to some mode of representation common with Jewish teachers employed to exhibit similar allegories (see Bengel's note above referred to). We may, therefore, conclude that the subject of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, whatever it is, is regarded by the apostle as standing in the same category with the now subsisting Jerusalem, especially in the particular respect which he presently insists upon; namely, as being characterized by slavery. For this is the main point of this whole  allegorical illustration; that Judaism is slavery and the Christian state liberty. It is not clear whether the subject of this verb, "standeth in the same column with," is "the covenant from Mount Sinai," or "Hagar," or "Sinai." If either of the two former, then the first clause of this verse is a parenthesis. The construction runs the most smoothly by adopting the third view, which takes" Sinai" as the subject. Sinai, that gave forth the covenant which is represented by Hagar, "stands in the same column" with "the Jerusalem that now is;" for Sinai is the starting-place of the covenant which has now its central abode in Jerusalem; the people that was <span class="accented">there</span> is now <span class="accented">here</span>; and the condition of slavery into which Sinai's covenant brought them marks them now at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And is in bondage with her children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">for she is in bondage with her children.</span> The reading <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> is substituted for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> by the editors with general consent. That the subject of the verb "is in bondage" is "the Jerusalem that now is," is apparent from the contrasted sentence which next follows, "but the Jerusalem that is above is free." "With her children;" repeatedly did our Lord group Jerusalem with" her children "(<a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-35.htm">Luke 13:35</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/19-44.htm">Luke 19:44</a>), having, however, in view the city itself with its inhabitants; while St. Paul probably regards Jerusalem more in idea, as representing Judaism in its central manifestation; "her children" being consequently these who were living under the Law. The apostle here <span class="accented">assumes</span> that this mystical Jerusalem with her children was in bondage, making the fact a ground for identifying her with Hagar. That the fact was so St. Paul knew, both from his own experience and from his observation of others. The religious life of Judaism consisted of a servile obedience to a letter Law of ceremonialism, interpreted by the rabbins with an infinity of hair-splitting rules, the exact observance of which was bound upon the conscience of its votaries as of the essence of true piety. The apostle also probably took account of the slavish spirit which very largely characterized the religious teaching of the ruling doctors of Judaism; their bondage, that is, not only to the letter of the Law, but to the traditions also of men; that spirit which those who heard the teaching of the Lord Jesus felt to be so strongly contrasted by <span class="accented">his</span> manner of conceiving and presenting religious truth. "He taught as one having authority, and not as the scribes." But the main point now contemplated by the apostle was bondage to ceremonialism.

This is identical with the "heavenly Jerusalem" of <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>, which, standing in contrast with the "mount that might be touched and that burned with fire," Sinai with its soul-crushing terrors, appears associated with the pacifying blood of Jesus, and with communion with all that is holiest and most glorious. The essential identity of the contrast in the two passages, which are mutually illustrative, bespeaks a common origin in one and the same mind. The supernal Jerusalem is not chiefly contrasted with the Jerusalem "that now is," in point of time: she is not the future only, though in the future to be <span class="accented">manifested -</span> the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down (as St. John writes) from God out of heaven (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>); but she <span class="accented">is</span> there <span class="accented">now</span>, with God. It would be in harmony with St. Paul's representation to suppose that he conceives of her having been there with God in heaven of old, her citizens upon earth being the true servants of God in all ages. In former ages, however, she was comparatively barren; it needed that the enthronization of the God-Man, "the Mediator of the new covenant" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-24.htm">Hebrews 12:24</a>), on "God's holy hill of Zion," should take place before she could become the prolific mother here shown to us. Commentators refer to rabbinical speculations relative to a Jerusalem which was conceived of as existing in heaven, as illustrated by Schottgen's 'Dissertatio de Hierosol. Caelesti' ('Hor. Hebr.,' vol. 1. diss. 5.), and also by Wetstein both here and on <a href="../../par/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. It would be interesting if we could determine when those rabbinical speculations first arose, and how far it may be judged probable that they or some earlier form of them out of which these sprang suggested anything to St. Paul for the form in which he clothed his own conception of this idea; there may have been such. Meanwhile, we cannot but be struck by the purely ideal and spiritual character in which the apostle here exhibits his conception of it; though something like a terrene manifestation in the future seems indicated in <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>. "Is free;" the counterpart of Sarah, as mentioned in vers. 22, 23. That this Jerusalem is free, the apostle feels it needless to state; she to his very consciousness is the very home and bosom of God's love, having her  very existence, as well as her outward-acting power, in his pervading, actuating Spirit. Bondage, constraint, <span class="accented">there</span> cannot be; for all volitions are there harmonized, absorbed, by the Spirit of love uniting her component elements both with each other and with God. <span class="cmt_word">Which is the mother of us all</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>]) <span class="accented">which is our mother.</span> Here again, as in ver. 24, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> means "<span class="accented">which</span>, being such as she <span class="accented">is</span>, is our mother." We look at the Jerusalem that is above, and in her princely freedom we recognize what we her children are. The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which the Textus Receptus has before <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and which is by the general consent of critics rejected, is with much probability supposed to have come into the text by the copyist's recollection of the similar sentence in <a href="../../par/romans/4-16.htm">Romans 4:16, 17</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. But <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which there belongs to the essential thought of the context that God had made Abraham "the father of many nations," is unnecessary here, where the apostle is chiefly concerned with the freedom which characterizes the family of promise. If documentary evidence proved it to be genuine, it would find its justification in the notion of the fruitfulness which now at length, as the apostle presently shows, is given to the supernal Jerusalem. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/4-27.htm">Galatians 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">For it is written, Rejoice, <i>thou</i> barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>). The points indicated in the section of Isaiah (54.) referred to by the quotation which is made of the first verse, and which amply make good what the apostle has been stating and implying, are these: that a new economy was to appear; that by this economy a multitude of servants of God should be called into being; that this multitude should in numbers far surpass those called into being heretofore; that this economy, though newly manifested, had been in existence before, but comparatively unblest with offspring; that it was to be known as an economy of forgiving, adopting love, involving a principle of spiritual life and of spontaneous, no longer constrained and servile, obedience. We need not hesitate in asserting that the last-named features of the new economy were, in the apostle's view, included in the prediction he means to refer to, although not contained in those words of the prophet which he has expressly quoted. For it is one of the characteristics of a Jewish religious teacher's method of citing Scripture, noted by the learned Dr. Biesenthal, himself a Jew, in his 'Commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews' ('Einleitung,' p. 54), that he is wont to omit in his express citation more or <span class="accented">less</span> of the passage referred to, leaving it to his hearer or reader to supply the omitted portions from his own knowledge, even when these are most material for the argument; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13, 14</a>, the" oath," fully recorded in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>, is not itself contained in the citation made by the writer. The above-named, then, we may assume to have been points which the apostle regarded as contained in the passage he refers to, because they are contained in the section of which the cited words are an integral portion. Whatever may be thought of the applicability, <span class="accented">in a measure</span>, of the prophet's language in the section alluded to, to the case of Israel restored from the Babylonian captivity, yet that such an application furnishes no complete explanation of its import is clear from the circumstance that this jubilant prophesying follows immediately upon the delineation in the preceding chapter of the sufferings of Christ - a delineation which ended with the intimation of the results which should follow in the triumph over mighty powers opposing the Sufferer, and in the work of justification which he would accomplish upon "many" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10-12</a>). That the section was understood by our Lord to refer to the new economy which he was himself to introduce, is evidenced by his citing the words, "All thy children shall be taught of the Lord" (ver 13), as pointing to the spiritual illumination which should at the time referred to characterize the people of God universally, so universally that none would be numbered amongst God's true people, that is, amongst the disciples of his Son, who had not "heard from the Father" (<a href="../../par/john/6-45.htm">John 6:45</a>). We have, then, in this section of Isaiah a distinctly <span class="accented">predictive</span> description of a condition of spiritual well-being which was to result from Christ's mediation; that is, of the illumination, peace and joyful sense of God's love which then should be the "heritage of the servants of the Lord." This, construed in the apostle's imagery, connecting itself with that of the words which he expressly quotes, is the large multiplication of the children of the freewoman, bringing forth her offspring into a state of freedom and adoption in the great Father's family. The Greek rendering of the passage given by the apostle is identical with that of the Vatican text of the Septuagint. The Alexandrian text varies only in adding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "and be glad," to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "cry." apparently to explain what kind of crying out was intended<span class="cmt_word">. Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). The Authorized Version as well as the Revised thus renders the Greek here; but in the original passage in Isaiah the former renders, "that didst not bear." the Hebrew having the preterite indicative; and similarly, the "travailest not" in the next clause here is "didst not travail" there.

It points in the present case to the solitary and unhappy condition of a woman "forsaken by her husband" (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>). On the other hand, the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, render the one Hebrew word <span class="accented">be'ulah</span>, the passive participle of the verb <span class="accented">ba'al</span>, cohabit with. Compare the use of this verb in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24</a>. I ("married her," Authorized Version; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;</span>, Septuagint); <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-13.htm">Deuteronomy 21:13</a>, "and be her husband." The words, therefore, denote her that had her husband living with her as such; "hath," as <a href="../../par/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>. "The husband" is conceived of as belonging both to her and of right to the "desolate one." Perhaps <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> may be rendered "her husband." In the prophet's view, the "woman which had her husband" was the visible Israel, possessing the temple and the other tokens of the Lord's dwelling in her midst; the "desolate one" was the spiritual or the ideal Israel to be manifested in the future; for the present out of sight and seemingly in abeyance; but thereafter to he quickened into fertility by the inhabitation of the Lord (for he in the prophet's vision, ver. 5, is the Husband), revealed in his first suffering then glorified Servant as portrayed in the foregoing prophesying. So exactly do these two images correspond with "the Jerusalem that now is" and "the Jerusalem that is above," of the apostle's imagery, that his use of the prophet's words is plainly no mere accommodation to his purpose of language which was in reality alien to the subject, but is the citation of a passage regarded by him as strictly predictive, and therefore probative of the truth of his representation. The view of this prophecy of Isaiah found in Clemens Romanus, Ep. it., 'Ad Corinthians,' &sect; 2, and in Justin Martyr, 'Apol.,' p. 88, which regards it as referring to the Gentile Church as contrasted with the Jewish, is plainly a misconception of its import: the rejoicing mother of the prophet, as well as the supernal Jerusalem of the apostle, knows of no distinction in her believing offspring, between Jew and Gentile, comprising both alike.

The apostle is viewing Isaac as in the manner of his being brought into being, the type, to which the children of the mystic freewoman were in after ages to be assimilated. In both cases the children are born or begotten through a promise which God of his own free grace hath given, and which, by an accepting faith, is appropriated and made effectual. Thus Isaac was born (see ver. 23 and <a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8, 9</a>). The children of the supernal Jerusalem are begotten through the gospel, which in effect is a promise of adoption through Christ to be children of God held out to all who will accept it. Obviously the cases differ in this - that in one it was the faith of the parents which made the promise effectual; in the other, the faith of those who in consequence of believing become children. But none the less is it true that the result is due to an announcement proceeding out of God's own free grace - "Not of works but of him that calleth" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7-13</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-15.htm">1 Corinthians 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/james/1-18.htm">James 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>). The "promise" is not the parent of the children; this, in the imagery now present to the apostle's mind, is in the antitypal case the mystic Freewoman. The genitive "of promise" is a genitive of qualification, pointing here to the means through which the children are begotten. Compare a somewhat similarly loose use of the genitive in <a href="../../par/romans/9-8.htm">Romans 9:8</a>, "Not the children of the flesh.., but the children of the promise." The case of baptized infants is not in the apostle's view.

(For the phrase, "after," or "according to, the Spirit," see note on ver. 23.) It must be conceded that the apostle somewhat strains the expression in applying it to the case of Isaac; but he does it for the purpose of exhibiting the manner of his birth as homogeneous with that of his antitypes; for these are they of whom it is the more characteristically true; for they are begotten through the Spirit's agency, into the Spirit's kingdom, to be to the uttermost perfected by the Spirit. The imperfect <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, was persecuting, points to the scene presented to our view in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>, in the midst of which intervenes the injunction," Cast out," etc.; or possibly the apostle regards what then took place as one among other incidents exhibiting the same animus on the part of Ishmael. We cannot doubt that St. Paul points to the word "mocking," which occurs in the passage referred to. At the feast held in honour of Isaac's being weaned, "Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking." The same Hebrew verb is used of insult and disrespect in <a href="../../par/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a>, "<span class="accented">He</span> hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock <span class="accented">us</span>;" so again ver. 17. The Septuagint, as we now have it, instead of "mocking," has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f70;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "at play with Isaac her son;" which would indicate no unkindness on Ishmael's part, but suggest the idea that Sarah's resentment was simply a movement of jealous feeling, roused by her seeing Ishmael assuming a position of equality with a child of hers. But the apostle disregards this interpretation, if indeed the words, "with Isaac her sons" had already then been interpolated into the passage. As those words are not in the Hebrew, the participles lacking any such explanatory adjunct, would fail of itself to express this idea. It is further rendered improbable by the disparity in age between the two lads; for Isaac, having been just weaned, would be only two or three years old, whilst Ishmael would be sixteen or seventeen. It is much more likely that Ishmael, having arrived at these years, participated in Hagar's feelings of jealousy and disappointment that this child should have come to supersede him in the position which, but for this, he might have held in the family; and that, on the occasion of this "great feast," by which the aged pair were celebrating their pious joy ever this "child of promise" as well as very markedly signalizing his peculiar position as Abraham's heir, the elder-born indulged himself in ill-natured and very possibly profane ridicule of the circumstances under which Isaac was born. Hagar's feelings towards her mistress had of old been those of upstart insubordination (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>). That both mother and son were very greatly in the wrong is evidenced by the sanction which Heaven accorded to the punishment with which they were visited. The critics (see Wetstein) quote the following passage from the rabbinical treatise, 'Bereshith rabb.,' 53, 15. "Rabbi Asaria said: Ishmael said to Isaac, 'Let us go and see our portion in the field;' and Ishmael took bow and arrows, and shot at Isaac, and pretended that he was in sport." St. Paul's view, therefore, of the import of the Hebrew participle rendered "mocking" is corroborated by the rabbinical interpretation of the word - a consideration which in such a case is of no small weight. The particular word, "persecuted," with which the apostle describes Ishmael's behaviour to his half-brother, was, no doubt, like the expression, "born after the Spirit," suggested by the antitypal case to which he is comparing it. But the features justifying its application to Ishmael viewed as typical were these - spiteful jealousy; disregard of the will of God; antipathy to one chosen of God to be Abraham's seed; abuse of superior power. <span class="cmt_word">Even so it is</span> now (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">even so</span> he <span class="accented">does now.</span> The full sentence represented by this elliptic one is: "even so now does he that is born after the flesh persecute him that is born after the Spirit." This was a fact with which the apostle's experience was but too familiar. In <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor itself, as the Acts abundantly testifies, from city to city had he been dogged by the animosity of the "children of Hagar." No doubt something of this had been witnessed even in the Galatian towns, of the evangelization of which we have no equally full particulars; there, too, we may believe, St. Paul's converts had had to note the abhorrence with which their master was regarded by the adherents of the old religion; and it was natural that this should have a tendency to lessen his hold upon their minds; for were not the Jews the ancient Israel of God, the depositaries of his revelations? Moreover, the hostility which harassed <span class="accented">him</span> would also alight more or less upon <span class="accented">them</span> as being disciples of his (see Jerusalem that is above; etc. Galatians 6:12, and note). All this might make some of them the more ready to listen to Judaizing suggestions. In this verse, therefore, St. Paul is not merely breathing out a sorrow of his own but is fortifying the Galatian believers against a temptation assaulting themselves.

"Nevertheless:" man is acting thus; but, what cloth <span class="accented">God</span> say touching the matter? The similar question in <a href="../../par/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4</a>, "But what saith the answer of God (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) to him?"  favours the belief that by "the Scripture" the apostle does not mean Scripture in general (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/john/10-35.htm">John 10:35</a>), but the particular "passage of Scripture" to which he is referring (cf. <a href="../../par/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>). The animation of his tone is that of the triumphant assertion of the Almighty's will as an all-suffering answer to all objections and all discouragements. For "the Scripture" is equivalent to "the utterance of God;" not merely as found in an inspired volume, but because of the circumstances attending upon the speaking of the words (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>: <a href="../../par/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>). They were, indeed, uttered by Sarah; being, however, not words of a simply jealous and petulant woman, but of a righteously indignant matron, whose just, if severe, requirement was enforced upon the reluctant Abraham by God's own express command. The historical fact itself, as thus recorded, was singularly noticeable, standing in a position marking it as peculiarly significant: that it really was a type, prophetical of a certain future spiritual procedure, is ascertained for us by the apostle's exposition. <span class="cmt_word">Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">cast out the handmaid and her son</span>: <span class="accented">for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</span> The Septuagint has "Cast out <span class="accented">this</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>) handmaid and her son; for the son of this (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) handmaid shall not inherit with <span class="accented">my son Isaac</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;</span>);" the apostle's citation being literally exact, except that it has not the words <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (which are not in the Hebrew), and substitutes "the son of the freewoman" for "my son Isaac." His object in these 'changes, which do not in the least affect the substance, is to mark the utterance the more distinctly as God's own voice, speaking of the parties concerned, not as Sarah did, being one of them, but as supreme Ruler and Judge: for the Lord adopted her decision for his own. In respect to Ishmael's exclusion from inheriting, the instance of Jephthah (<a href="../../par/judges/11-1.htm">Judges 11:1, 2</a>), excluded in somewhat similar terms by the legitimate sons of his father ("Thou shalt not inherit in the house of our father; for the son of a harlot woman art thou"), does not apply. Hagar was not a "harlot;" but stood <span class="accented">with respect to Sarah</span> in much the same position as did Bilhah and Zilpah to Rachel and Leah. We cannot doubt but that the discrimination made between the two sons, whatever was the character of Sarah's feelings in the matter, is to be ascribed to God's own sovereign appointment (see <a href="../../par/romans/9-7.htm">Romans 9:7, 11</a>). In this terrible sentence, by which Hagar and Ishmael were driven forth beyond the pale of God's most especial guardianship and blessing, the apostle hears the voice of God bidding away from his covenant all who disbelieved the gospel - all, that is, who set aside God's assurances of his tree unmerited love to all who believed in Jesus. It should seem that it was mainly for the purpose of introducing this denunciation that the apostle has been at the pains to trace out the allegorical meaning of the narrative. The apostle is not now thinking of the national excision of the Jews; he is contemplating, not nationalities, but habits of mind - servile legality on the one side, and on the other faith accepting a free gift of grace. It is at their extreme peril, he in effect tells the Galatians, that they forsake the latter to take up with the former: God has shown that by so doing they will forfeit the inheritance altogether.

The following are the probable translations of these several forms of the text: - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "Therefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: stand fast then in [or, 'by,' or, 'to'] the freedom with which Christ set us free; and do not again get held in a yoke of bondage." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman: with freedom did Christ set us free; stand fast, then," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a handmaid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the freewoman; in the freedom with which Christ set us free stand fast, then, and," etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> "Wherefore, brethren, we are not a hand maid's children, but <span class="accented">children</span> of the free woman by [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> 'by virtue of'] the freedom [or, 'children of her who is free with that free dora'] with which Christ set us free; stand fast, then, and," etc. It will be seen by the above that there appears a general agreement among recent editors of the Greek text upon three points: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> they all substitute <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> - an alteration which makes no  difference whatever in the sense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> they expunge the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> they insert <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>. The forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> are identical except in the punctuation. The construction of the dative <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> in forms <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is difficult, and has not yet been quite satisfactorily accounted for. We miss the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, to express the idea of <span class="accented">immanence</span> which is evidently intended, and to express which <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> is elsewhere found present; as <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-13.htm">1 Corinthians 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:8</a>. The arrangement given in form <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> is, in addition, greatly embarrassed by the "then" standing so far on in the sentence - this particle marking, as it does, an inference from the sentence in the preceding verse. The furthest place in the sentence adduced by Winer ('Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 61) is the fourth word, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>. The fourth form presents by far the easiest construction. It seems strange, however, if this was the original text, that it came to be changed into shapes so much more difficult to construe. In the second form, the clause, "with freedom did Christ set us free," seems somewhat strangely phrased; but this iteration of the idea of freedom, marking the apostle's anxious insistance upon it, may have led the copyists to suspect an error of transcription, and thus have set them upon the endeavour to improve, as they thought, the text before them. The same anxious insistance upon an idea leads the apostle to a somewhat similar introduction of a clause which is almost a parenthesis, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5</a>, "By grace have ye been saved." It will be noticed that the variations in the text above noted make not the smallest difference in the main contents of thought. The same factors of thought are present in all. The further remarks now to be made will assume for their basis the second form of the text. <span class="accented">Wherefore</span>, <span class="accented">brethren</span>, <span class="accented">we are not a handmaid's children</span>, <span class="accented">but</span> children <span class="accented">of the freewoman.</span> This, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;</span> (Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>) gathers up the result of the whole foregoing allegorical exposition, not that of its concluding portion only, as a basis for practical remark. "We are not a handmaid's children;" that is, "It is not a slave-girl that is our mother." The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, not because the apostle is thinking, as some imagine, of there being other handmaids besides Mosaism, as, for example, heathen ceremonialism; for the context points to only one slave-girl that can possibly answer to Hagar; but because he wishes by contrast to fasten attention upon the character of her who is our mother. Hence also there is no <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, as in ver. 28. "<span class="accented">But children</span> of the <span class="accented">freewoman</span>," or "of her who is free;" not defining what individual is our mother, but, who our mother is being now assumed as known, marking what her condition is. <span class="accented">With freedom did Christ set us free</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). 'This clause both justifies and explains the word "freewoman." Our mother is a freewoman, because all her children have been emancipated by Christ; and the nature of her freedom is likewise defined by the nature of his work. This sense is more directly asserted in the fourth form of the Greek text - "children of the freewoman by the freedom with which Christ set us free;" but it is in reality contained in the second. Christ's emancipating work was twofold: he at once, by his atonement, effected our deliverance from guilt, and by the manner of his death (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>) disconnected his people from the ceremonial Law. The former aspect of his work is essential to the beneficial effect of the latter. The clear realization of the fact that he has effected our perfect reconciliation with God cuts up from its roots all desire even, that we should ourselves strive, either to make or to keep ourselves acceptable with God by obedience to a Law of positive ordinances; while we also must see that, as connected with a Crucified One, it is impossible that we can be in harmony with the Mosaic ritual. A desire to Judaize cannot eoexist with true faith in our crucified Redeemer. By affirming that Christ hath set us free, the apostle points, not merely to our release from real or fancied obligation to obey the Law of Moses, but also to our "joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received reconciliation "(<a href="../../par/romans/5-11.htm">Romans 5:11</a>). <span class="accented">Stand fast</span>, <span class="accented">therefore.</span> According to this reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> standing alone receives its colour of reference from the context. So <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>. Here it means the steadfast holding to a whole-hearted assurance that in Christ Jesus our freedom is complete. <span class="accented">And do not again get held in a yoke of bondage.</span> The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> used (Herod., 2:121) literally of being caught and held fast by a man-trap; also figuratively of being entangled with perplexities (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, Herod., 1:190), with a curse, or with guilt, or with arbitrary dicta of a teacher (see Liddell and Scott). The condition of a slave is described by the word "yoke," <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-1.htm">1 Timothy 6:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, "As many as are bond-servants under the yoke." And it was probably with this particular shade of meaning that St. Peter used the term at the conference at Jerusalem respecting the ceremonial Law (<a href="../../par/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>) - "a yoke which neither we nor our fathers had strength enough to bear;" referring to it, we may suppose, as slavery, not merely because obedience to it was difficult, but as being observed from a legalistic anxiety to approve one's self thereby to the Divine acceptance or to escape the Divine displeasure. This view of the passage explains how the apostle  was able to use the word "again" of these Galatian converts. They had been once under the yoke of an "evil conscience;" but Christ had come to them also, who were "afar off" in Gentile guiltiness, preaching peace, as he had come to them that were "nigh" in the Israelite covenant (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-17.htm">Ephesians 2:17</a>). But if they could not have "peace" and "access to the Father" save through conformity with Mosaic eeremonialism, then their "freedom" was forfeited; they sank back again into their former state of bondage. But see also the note on ver. 9. This exhortation to "stand fast" presupposes that they had not yet lapsed, but were only in danger of it (comp. the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../galatians/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Galatians 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Galatians 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../galatians/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Galatians 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Galatians 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/galatians/5.htm"><title>Galatians 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/galatians/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/galatians/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/galatians/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../galatians/4.htm" title="Galatians 4">&#9668;</a> Galatians 5 <a href="../galatians/6.htm" title="Galatians 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - (See p. 209.)

The apostle, on the other hand, is here not thinking of outward corporeal condition; for he presently (ver. 6) affirms that in Christ Jesus it mattered nothing whether a man were in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> or in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as indeed he proved to be his feeling by circumcising Timothy (<a href="../../par/acts/16-3.htm">Acts 16:3</a>). It is the posture of mind that the apostle-is thinking of exclusively. What was this? The very warning of this verse shows, that, in wishing for circumcision, these Galatians did not <span class="accented">intend</span> to withdraw from Christ; and it appears from the next verse that they did not, either, contemplate the doing of the whole Law. But then, too, the fourth verse, in which apparently the apostle means to explain and justify the assertion of this second verse, indicates that they sought circumcision with the view of  being justified by the Law; not, as has just been remarked, by obeying the whole Law, but by submitting themselves to the Law so far as undergoing this one rite prescribed by it. The conclusion to be drawn from these premisses is that what the apostle means is this: If ye have yourselves circumcised with the view of thereby obtaining righteousness before God, ye forfeit all hope of receiving benefit from Christ (see note on Galatians 4:10). In comparing the present passage with <a href="../../par/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12, 13</a>, we observe that, while here he is dealing with those who sought circumcision with the view of assuring their righteousness before God, he is there referring to persons actuated by an altogether different set of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Christ shall profit you nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). "The future tense marks the certain result of their being circumcised: 'Christ (as you will find) will never profit you anything'" (Bishop Ellicott). The future time is not, in particular, for example, the time of Christ's second coming; but that which follows upon their receiving circumcision - the hour in which their distrust in Christ eventuated in the overt act of having themselves circumcised for the purpose of gaining righteousness thereby, would decisively cut them off from Christ. Their circumcision would be for them the sacrament of excision from Christ. We may compare with this the awful passage referring to the consequences accruing to Jewish Christians from their relapsing to Judaism, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-30</a>. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this passage, in determining the relation between trust in Christ's atonement and participation in the benefits of that atonement. It is at his extreme peril that a Christian allows himself in misgivings as to whether Christ's mediation is all-sufficient for the securing of his peace with God and his part in God's kingdom. It is by <span class="accented">reliance</span> upon Christ's work that his salvation through Christ is secured; by <span class="accented">distrust</span> in it his salvation is brought into peril; by <span class="accented">definite unbelief</span> his salvation is forfeited. This is in perfect accordance with the apostolic doctrine in general; but rarely is it so strongly and incisively asserted as it is here.

The original construction and force of the verb are shown in Judith 7:28, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>. The apostle is wont to use it with a distinct sense of its emphatic import (see <a href="../../par/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). The word "again" points, not to the substance of the subsequent affirmation, as if it were a repetition of that mode in the preceding verse, which in fact it does not appear to be, but to the solemnity with which he makes this fresh affirmation. For the phrase, "I Paul say unto you," was one form of solemn affirmation which in effect gaged his personality as Christ's apostle and as acting in his name; and this "I protest" is another of equally solemn import. <span class="cmt_word">To every man that is circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>); <span class="accented">to every man that is having himself circumcised.</span> St. Paul's statements elsewhere, and his own proceeding in circumcising Timothy, as well as the present context, make it certain that, however absolute and universal his affirmation at first sight seems to be, it is nevertheless meant to be taken as made with reference to certain understood conditions. Thus: "I protest to any one of you Gentiles, who, being already baptized into Christ, has himself circumcised with the view of winning righteousness and favour with God, by obeying this one prescription of the Law - that," etc. The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> is most probably the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> of transition (metabatic), introducing a fresh particular merely; and in this instance, as often, it needs not to be represented in translation at all. Certainly s for" is not its meaning. Possibly, as De Wette supposes, it points back, as an adversative, to the words," Christ shall profit you nothing," as if it were "but on the contrary." <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">he is a debtor to do the whole Law</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti o)feile/th</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">that he is under obligation</span> (Greek, <span class="accented">is a debtor</span>) <span class="accented">to do the whole Law.</span> By having himself circumcised, he adopts the token of the Lord's covenant (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-11.htm">Genesis 17:11, 13</a>) made with those who were his people after the flesh; he enrolls himself with them to share with them their obligations. And to them the Lord had given the Law of Mount Sinai to be their appointed <span class="accented">pedagogue</span> till the Christ should come. "By being circumcised" (he means) "you of your own accord put yourself back afresh under this pedagogue, and just <span class="accented">his</span> bidding you must do. And for what? All the ordinances and ceremonies he puts you upon observing will leave you as far off as ever from remission of sins and justification with God! And this self-surrender to the pedagogue God has not asked for at <span class="accented">your</span> hands; while what he does require, that you withhold, even faith in him whom he hath sent: nay, not merely withhold your belief, but by open act and deed testify your <span class="accented">disbelief</span> in him." Under all that the apostle is here writing there appears to lie the principle, which, however, he has not distinctly stored, but which we see to be true, that circumcision was the peculiar badge of "Israel after the flesh," appertaining to them alone  and not to be meddled with by any who did not mean to become naturalized as fellow-citizens with them. (For the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14</a>.)

The sense given in the Authorized Version is perfectly justifiable; only, perhaps, here the passive takes, as it sometimes does, the reflective sense of the middle verb; but it may be that the apostle means simply to express the result which has accrued.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> is used as in <a href="../../par/2_peter/3-17.htm">2 Peter 3:17</a>, "Lest - <span class="accented">ye</span> <span class="accented">fall from</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) your own steadfastness." So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/2-5.htm">Revelation 2:5</a>, "Remember whence thou hast fallen [<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>]." In classical Greek the verb was frequently used as a set term to describe those who, in the alternating success of adverse factions in the several independent cities of Greece, were compelled by a more powerful adverse party to submit to exile; its correlative verb being <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>. This fact leads Bishop Lightfoot, having an eye to the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/4-30.htm">Galatians 4:30</a>, to render <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> here, "<span class="accented">are driven forth and banished</span> with Hagar your mother." But this very idiomatic colour of meaning it seems very precarious to give to the word in the Greek of St. Paul. The more general signification of the term is amply sustained by its use in Plutarch as cited by Wetstein.

It is here referred to as evincing the Divine sanction which attaches to the particular action of faith and hope now to be described (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Wait</span> <span class="cmt_word">for the hope of righteousness by faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">from</span> the ground <span class="accented">of faith do wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> The term which has the principal accent in this clause is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the ground of faith." This appears, both from the preceding context, in which the opposed idea of "justification by the Law" holds the foremost place, requiring here the confronting mention of "faith," and also from the next verse, which substantiates the statement before us by affirming the all-importance of "faith." In point of construction, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> does not appear to qualify "righteousness," although, from the classical text <a href="../../par/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> (Septuagint), it is so often connected with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: but rather the whole clause, "wait for the hope of righteousness." What the apostle is now concerned to say is that it is by virtue of our faith that we look forward to hereafter receiving the hope of righteousness. This, of course, includes our being by faith justified. The word "hope" here designates the object hoped for, and not the sentiment itself. So <a href="../../par/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>, "hope that is seen;" <a href="../../par/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>, "the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens;"  <a href="../../par/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, "looking for the blissful hope." The genitive, "of righteousness," may be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the "genitive of apposition," the hope which is, or which consists of, righteousness, similar to the genitives in the phrases, "the earnest of the Spirit," "the sign of circumcision,' ' "the leaven of malice," "the recompense of the inheritance," "the peaceable fruit of righteousness" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-5.htm">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-24.htm">Colossians 3:24</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>); or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "the hope of righteousness" may mean the hope that appertains unto righteousness, which would be the "inheritance" spoken of in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-18.htm">Galatians 3:18, 22</a>, as accruing, not "from the Law," but to those who are justified by faith. The apostle is not wont to speak of justification as a blessing to be received at the day of final decision, to which he evidently here refers, but as a blessing received at once by those who believe in Christ as the fruit even here of their faith. Thus <a href="../../par/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>, "Being justified (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) by faith, we have peace with God;" ibid., ver. 11, "We have now received the reconciliation." Thus also in this Epistle (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24-27</a>) it is declared that, in consequence of being justified by faith, we are clothed with Christ and God's adopted sons (see also <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6, 7</a>). There can surely be no question of the already received justification of those in whom the Spirit testifies that they are sons. Nor does <a href="../../par/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a> ("That I may be found in him, having... the righteousness which is through faith in Christ" ) speak a different language: he aspires (he there says) to be in that final judgment found in possession of a righteousness which he had received in this life through the faith which he had in this life exercised. As Bengel here observes, "Paul, in mentioning things beyond, includes and confirms things present." Of Judaical legalism it was true that it did not think itself already possessed of righteousness, but with an ever-unappeased conscience was always still striving after it; whereas it is the privilege and glory of faith that it can enjoy the assurance of being even now justified and at peace with, "at one" with, God. Most certainly, what the apostle here calls "hope" is not the sentiment which we so often thus name when we intend thereby an imperfectly assured expectation of some probably coming good. In the apostle's vocabulary it denotes a confident anticipation unclouded by doubt (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23-25</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>). In fine, this is what the apostle means: We Christians, as led by the Spirit of adoption, do rest in the confident anticipation of receiving the inheritance which is the future award of the righteous, on the ground of our faith in the Lord Jesus. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in all the six other passages in which it is found, is used with reference to objects or events pertaining to the close of the present dispensation: <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19, 23, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>. The proposition <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> in this compound verb is probably intensive, expressing thorough-goingness; an entirely assured, steadfast expectation, persistent to the end.

"In Christ Jesus" means more than in Christ's religion. We had the phrase above, <a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, "All ye are one man in Christ Jesus." It occurs frequently in St. Paul's writings; remarkable instances are supplied in <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>, "who were in Christ before me;" ibid., 11, "which are in the Lord;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a>, "of him [i.e. of God] are ye in Christ Jesus." It is, perhaps, best illustrated by our Lord's own parable of the vine in <a href="../../par/john/15-1.htm">John 15:1-4</a>. The spiritual union with Christ therein portrayed is maintained and operative through the action of the soul habitually cleaving to and depending upon him, and constantly receiving from him responsive gifts of spiritual vitality and power. <span class="cmt_word">Neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which Worketh by love</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">neither circumcision availeth anything</span>, <span class="accented">nor uncircumcision</span>; <span class="accented">but faith operative through love.</span> In two other passages the apostle makes a very similar statement. One is below, <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>, "For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature." The other is <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, which with its context runs thus: "Was any one called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>). Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God." The comparison of these three passages suggests: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That the "availeth not anything" now before us is tantamount to the "neither is anything" and to the "is nothing" of the other two passages; and that the meaning in each case is that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any <span class="accented">effect for good</span>; for since the anti-thetic affirmation in all three cases states what <span class="accented">i</span>s effectual for good, it is obvious to infer that it was of a beneficial effect only that the apostle was thinking in the foregoing statement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This leads to the question why "uncircumcision" should be thus repeatedly affirmed, twice to the Galatians, to be of no beneficial effect. More  must be meant than a mere completing of the sentence by adding to the mention of "circumcision" the mention of its opposite. It is clear that there were those who imagined that uncircumcision made a favourable difference in men's religious condition, just as there were others, like these Galatian reactionaries, who imagined that circumcision did. That there were persons to be found in the Church who held the former view is put beyond doubt by the exhortation," Let him not become uncircumcised," which immediately precedes <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, now under review with the passage immediately before us; with reference to which exhortation comp. 1 Macc. 1:15; Josephus, ' Ant,,' 12:5. I. It was in no such ways, the apostle tells them, that the Divine approval was to be either gained or secured; and only mischief would result from entering upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The antithetic affirmation of what really <span class="accented">is</span> effectual for our spiritual well-being varies in the three passages; but it is natural to infer that <span class="accented">that</span> which in all three is declared to be the thing of vital importance, either is at bottom one and the same thing, or at least necessarily involves it. "Faith operative through love" must be identical with, or involve, "the keeping of the commandments of God," and "a new creature." A close examination of the first of these three sentences will show that it is so. The participle <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> cannot be a passive, as Estius maintained; who even asserted a passive sense for the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in all the eight other passages in which it is found (<a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-6.htm">2 Corinthians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-12.htm">2 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>). In perhaps not one of these passages is a passive meaning probable; while in some of them, as <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-29.htm">Colossians 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>, it is palpably inadmissible. In the case before us, if a passive sense were admitted, we should have the expression, "faith wrought in us by love;" an account of the <span class="accented">genesis</span> of faith which must be judged to be in the strictest sense of the word <span class="accented">preposterous.</span> Faith does indeed grow and become perfected through love; but it is not in the first instance wrought in us by love, except indeed it be God's love to us (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4</a>). In those passages of the New Testament in which the verb ' <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the active voice (<a href="../../par/matthew/14-2.htm">Matthew 14:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-8.htm">Galatians 2:8</a>, twice; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-6.htm">1 Corinthians 12:6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>), the subject of the verb is a personal agent, or one which, as in <a href="../../par/matthew/14-2.htm">Matthew 14:2</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/6-4.htm">Mark 6:4</a>, is probably spoken of as such. It is most commonly followed by an accusative of the thing wrought, which, however, is sometimes left to the reader to supply. The middle voice appears in St. Paul always to have for its subject an impersonal agent (Winer, ' Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 38, 6); and such an agent is said <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the sense always of "proving, acting out, its vitality and power," and never of simply "doing" such and such things. It is nowhere followed by an accusative. It is thus distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which either is followed by an accusative of the work done or is used absolutely of "doing work," as in <a href="../../par/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-4.htm">Romans 4:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>. The apostle, therefore, by the words, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> means not, "faith through love doing works of beneficence,' 'but "faith evincing its vitality and power through the love which it begets in us;" "faith by love operative and influential.' 'Love is not contemplated as a separate acting of the Spirit, added on to faith as it were by an extrinsic effort of the soul, but as a product of faith itself, by which faith exerts its own internal energy. The apostle's meaning becomes clearer if we consider the object on which the justifying faith of the Christian fastens. This the apostle describes in this Epistle as Christ, "who gave himself for our sins;" "who loved me and gave himself for me" (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>). When this marvellous exhibition of Divine compassion and love is through faith in very deed caught sight of and realized, it naturally becomes a truth-power, exercising over the man an influence imperative and supreme. This was the apostle's own experience; so much so that he seems to struggle with language while compelling it to describe the intensity of self-devotion with which it animated him. In this Epistle we may cite the passages <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-14.htm">Galatians 6:14</a>. And in other Epistles he writes in a similar strain. Let it suffice to cite <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14, 15</a>: "The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; and he died for all, that they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again;" adding, in ver. 17, "Wherefore if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature;... all things are of God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ" - words which show what he meant by the "new creature" mentioned below, <a href="../../par/galatians/6-15.htm">Galatians 6:15</a>. Thus the apostle evinces how in his own case faith through love became operative and influential. Christ's love to himself, on being realized by him, awakened in his soul a sentiment of grateful affection to his Redeemer, which was so strong and influential as thenceforward to sway and regulate the whole of his life. To complete, however, our estimate of the apostle's view of this matter, we must not forget to take account of the words "by the Spirit" in the preceding verse. The Spirit  alone can make even the love of Christ thus influential with our souls, which but for his quickening grace remain, even in sight of the cross, still numbed and cold. The accordance of the notion of "faith through love operative and influential" with that of a "new creature" has been already indicated; and no other principle than this can enable us for the "keeping of the commandments of God;" and this does, and even <span class="accented">constrains</span> the soul to keep them. "But," it may be asked, "does the ordinary experience of Christian men and women as we see them bear out this representation? Is faith in their case thus operative and influential?" It would be foolish to say that it is; with the average, even of those Christians who make a religious life their most serious concern, it is not. And the case was no doubt the same with the average of Christian believers in the apostle's own time. But this we can affirm: in proportion as our faith in Christ's being our reconciling Redeemer is vivid and real, in that proportion is it energizing and transforming. It is in its own nature essentially love-inspiring and consecrating. It argues a miserable defect in our faith when we have to supplement, as we so often must, its vitalizing power by injunctions and restraints of "the letter" and "the Law;" so far as it is so with us, so far we live as "bondmen" and not as "free." If "the Son makes us free, then are we free indeed;" and this is how he makes us free - he imparts to us the gift of love to himself; and that makes obedience to be no longer a constrained service, but a very instinct of our nature.

In ver. 13 he at length takes up a line of thought which he is able to follow on with fulness and fluency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye did run well</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">full well ye were running.</span> "To run" is a favourite figure with St. Paul, drawn from the foot-races of the Isthmian Games or other public games common throughout the Roman empire, and applied above (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>) to his own course of apostolic service, but here, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a>; and <a href="../../par/philippians/3-14.htm">Philippians 3:14</a>, in a wider reference to the course of general Christian obedience. In vers. 5, 6 the apostle has indicated the proper character of a Christian believer's life, as one which is animated by a faith energizing through love, and by the anticipation of attaining hereafter the awards to be rendered to the justified. Compare the general strain of thought, strikingly similar to that in the present context, pursued in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-15</a>. Obviously, one Important element in the comparison is the Christian's forward advance in self-improvement, as well as his continuing prosecution of work for Christ's cause. These characteristics had, and not long before, marked the manner of life of the Galatian Christians. Upon the recurrence of this recollection, here again, as in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1-4</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-16</a>, the apostle bewails the change that had taken place. They <span class="accented">had</span> been so full of joy and of love in believing (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-14.htm">Galatians 4:14, 15</a>). But now an incipient relinquishment of their hope in Christ had left them cheerless, and, in consequence, ready to look abroad in quest of other grounds of assured confidence; while also the thence ensuing conflicts of controversy and faction had marred their once happy mutual concord (ver. 15). The form of Christian life which the Galatian Churchmen had in those days presented to view was apparently similar to that which at an earlier date he had described as marking the Thessalonian Church (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>), and at a later time applauds in the Colossian (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4-6, 8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who aid hinder you</span>; or, <span class="accented">who did drive you back</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span>]). The <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> of the Textus Receptus would mean, as in the margin of our English Bibles, "Who has driven [or, beaten, struck] you back," and would be illustrated by the use of the verb in Wisd. 18:23, "Standing between, he beat back the wrath," as Aaron did. But <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;</span> is the reading of all recent editors. The precise meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> does not seem to be, as some suppose, "to stop," but rather "to hamper, shackle, impede." It occurs <a href="../../par/acts/24-4.htm">Acts 24:4</a>, "be tedious;" <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>, "Satan hindered;" <a href="../../par/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>, "hindered." So the substantive <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-12.htm">1 Corinthians 9:12</a>, "That we may cause no hindrance to [clog the success of] the gospel." Possibly this sense is derived from the hindrance caused to the traveller by the road being "cut into" or cut up before he goes over it. But it is more probably connected with the use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span> in the sense of "worry," as in Demosthenes, 'Olynth.,' it. p. 22, "Worried from time to time by these expeditions up and down." So here, "Who was it that clogged your steps in running your race?" Not positively "arrested your steps:" this disastrous result, it was to be hoped, was not yet brought about; they were only as yet lagging in their course. This interrogation "who" does not so much demand that the evil worker shall be named and brought to light, as express the pity of it, that any one  should have been able to work them so much mischief; as in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>. Nevertheless, the author of the mischief had cause to tremble (see ver. 12, and note). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should not obey the truth?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span> [T.

"The truth" directly cites the gospel; that is, the gospel which proclaims righteousness as theirs who believe in Christ apart from works of the ceremonial law; comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-5.htm">Galatians 3:5</a>, "That the truth of the gospel might continue with you," the particular phase of the gospel there intended being clearly evinced from the circumstances referred to. "Truth," without the article, denoting "that which is true," cites the same by implication. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, frequently rendered in the Authorized Version by "obey," as <a href="../../par/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a> and <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>, properly means to lend a compliant ear to advice or persuasion; "to hearken," as <a href="../../par/acts/5-36.htm">Acts 5:36, 37, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-21.htm">Acts 23:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>. The apostle means that they were turning their ears away from the truth to listen to pernicious counsels or teaching. The verb is in the present tense with reference to the continued attention which they ought to be now giving to the gospel.

And the comparison favours the conclusion that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span> denotes the disposition, state, or habit of mind evinced in being persuaded in the way now thought cf. So the Greek commentators (Ecumenius and Theophylact understand it of their <span class="accented">having been persuaded</span> to Judaize. The explanation of the noun as an active verbal, as if it were the persuasion which was soliciting them from without, does not seem to be so well berne out by its etymological formation, but appears nevertheless to be that accepted by Chrysostom. This noun, seemingly not often used, appears to have been selected by the apostle to brand the belief in the truth of Judaizing views which the Galatians were imbibing as being in nature diverse from the positive faith, which realizes the truth of the gospel; it is the product of over-persuasion, of cozenage even, rather than an acceptance of the plain setting forth of the simple truth, while "faith" is "the gift of God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-5.htm">Ephesians 2:5, 8</a>). <span class="accented">As</span> Chrysostom observes, ." It was not men's persuasion (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), but the power of God, which persuaded the souls of these who believe." By "him that calleth you" is plainly meant <span class="accented">God</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>). "The present participle is preferred here to the aorist, because the stress is laid on the <span class="accented">person</span> rather than the <span class="accented">act"</span> (Bishop Lightfoot). That persuasibleness of the Galatians was not from God; at the best it was from the world (comp. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>); but was it not, rather, from Satan, whose emissaries those false teachers were (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-15.htm">2 Corinthians 11:15</a>)? The apostle makes this assertion categorically, knowing it to be true. The gospel which he had brought to them had been sealed by the gifts of the Spirit accompanying its reception; while the doctrine they were now in danger of listening to was another thing altogether (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>) - a thing with an anathema upon it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-9.htm">Galatians 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>); <span class="accented">a little leaven leaveneth the whole kneading.</span> This proverb is cited again in precisely the same words in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>, with the words prefixed, "know ye not that." In both passages the leaven is an element of evil, and so also in <a href="../../par/matthew/16-11.htm">Matthew 16:11</a>; but our Lord applied it also to an element of good, which was to penetrate (apparently) the whole mass of humanity (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a>). What has the apostle precisely in his view as the leaven in the present instance? In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a> it is unchastity, which, if once tolerated in a Church, especially amid so licentious a population as that of Corinth, would be but too likely to impregnate balefully the sentiment of the whole community. And here likewise, as there, the leaven does not appear to denote, as some have supposed, the individuals in whom some noxious element was conspicuous, but that noxious element itself; namely, to judge from the colouring of the immediate context, the "readiness to hearken" to" another gospel," which was promising comfort and sense of acceptance, more or less, in the practice of at least some of the outward ordinances of Judaism. This leaven had already begun to work, embodying itself in the observance, pedantically and ostentatiously, of the days and feasts of the Jewish calendar (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-10.htm">Galatians 4:10</a>). Now, a movement of mind manifesting itself in some form of external religionism, when once it begins to show itself in a Christian community, has a great tendency to spread. For always, in every Church, there are unstable souls, too often not a few, never able to come to the knowledge of the truth; which have never truly discerned Christ's all-sufficiency for their spiritual needs, or have lost any superficial persuasion of it once enjoyed; and which, consciously  unsatisfied with what they as yet possess, and nevertheless only toying with spiritual things, are ready to adopt almost any novelty of religious behaviour offering itself for their acceptance. The particular form in which the external religionism of seekers after another gospel clothes itself varies according to varying tastes or circumstances. Among the Galatian Christians such persons were now beginning to feel attracted by that venerable kind of outward piety exhibited by devout or professedly devout Jews; but in their own practice committing the fatal blunder of mistaking the external shows of saintliness for the reality of saintliness, and but too willing to make the former serve in lieu of the latter. The danger of the leaven spreading was, in the present case, increased by the instability of character and the quick impulsiveness belonging to the Celtic temperament. The true antidote to this "leaven" is in every age the same; namely, that which the apostle in this Epistle strives to administer - the gospel of the righteousness and Spirit of Christ crucified.

The apostle has himself a vivid remembrance of their warm-hearted acceptance of his message (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-13.htm">Galatians 4:13-15</a>), and of their sufferings in the good cause (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-4.htm">Galatians 3:4</a>). "Have confidence with respect to you." The preposition <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> is used as in 2 Colossians 8:22, equivalently with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> in 2 <a href="../../par/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a> and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:4</a>; in which last passage ("We have confidence in the Lord touching you" ), as well as in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-24.htm">Philippians 2:24</a> ("I have confidence in the Lord that I myself shall come shortly" ), the phrase, "in the Lord," expresses, not the object of trust, but the sphere of consciousness in which he is able to feel this confidence. So also here, in the realized presence of the Lord Jesus, the apostle feels that his care for his people, and his faithfulness towards these in whom "he has begun a good work" so conspicuously as in their case, warrant him in entertaining a strong assurance that, after all, they would not disappoint his hopes (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-24.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:24</a>). This expression of confidence implies, of course, a measure of underlying apprehension; while it is also in effect an admonition, couched in an affectionate form, designed to rally them back to their true allegiance. The phrase, "with respect to you," separates their case from that of any who were "troubling them;" kindly implying that, in the main, they were still unperverted. <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye will be none otherwise minded</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%ti ou)de\n</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); that is, that your sentiments will continue, or will be found to be, such as I have been setting forth as those inspired by the gospel, and such as you once manifestly entertained. The future tense of the verb seems to point forward to the time when his appeal should have reached them, and have led them to bethink themselves as to what, in spite of perhaps some momentary superficial wavering, their sentiments at bottom really were. (For the sense of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, comp. <a href="../../par/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-15.htm">Philippians 3:15</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">But he that troubleth</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but he that is troubling</span> you. "But;" indicating that, even if such a person's machinations proved abortive, through their steady adherence to the gospel, that man should receive his deserts none the less. In <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> we had "There are some that trouble you," Comparing the two expressions, the one in the singular number, the other in the plural, we may conclude, <span class="accented">either</span> that the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> designates any one who shall be found falling under the description of a <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> any one of those referred to in the plural number; <span class="accented">or</span> that it points to one particular individual on whom the apostle had his eye as the prime ringleader of the rest. If we adopt the first view, the clause, "whosoever he be," appears to mark the absoluteness of the resolve expressed by the apostle, while leaving in indefiniteness the individual to whom it would apply. With the second view, the same clause would affirm that no circumstances attaching to the offender, such as (suppose) a mission from leading Churchmen in Jerusalem, or official eminence in a Galatian Church, or any other, should shield him, as he or others might suppose that it would, from the effect of the sentence to be pronounced upon him. The second seems the more probable view; and, in unison with it, it appears supposable that the hypothetical case stated in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-7.htm">Galatians 1:7</a> ("if we or an angel from heaven" ) had an eye to the eminent position held by the person here alluded to. This individualization of the threatening would make it the more telling when the letter should arrive - a thunder-clap bursting forth upon the head of that arch-troubler. <span class="cmt_word">Shall bear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">judgment, whosoever he be</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x1fbe;</span>).

The <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> judgment, is the "sentence;" the decision  of the judge upon his conduct, and the consequent punishment. The apostle threatens that he will bring into exercise the "power" which, as he says in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>, the Lord had given him for the edification of his people, and the use of which would be accompanied by consequences proving that "Christ was speaking in him" (ibid., 2, 3). Instances of its exercise are seen in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-11.htm">Acts 13:11</a>.

It seems that it had been affirmed by some one, most probably that individual "troubler" of the preceding verse (on which account the point is just here mentioned), that the apostle did himself "preach circumcision." The compellation "brethren" has a tone of pathos in it: it appeals, not merely to their knowledge of his experience of persecution, but to their sympathy with him under it, He is grappling to himself, as it were, the better-minded of those he is writing to. <span class="cmt_word">If I yet preach circumcision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">if I am still preaching circumcision.</span> The phrase, "preach circumcision," is like that of "preaching the baptism of repentance" in <a href="../../par/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>; it denotes openly declaring that men should be circumcised The force of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is best explained by supposing that the apostle is quoting the assertion of this gainsayer - "Why, Paul himself up to this hour still preaches circumcision, just as he did when he followed Judaism." And taking it thus, we may discern a shade of irony in the apostle's repeating the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> in his reply: "Why, then, am I still persecuted up to this hour?" He had begun to be the object of persecution as soon as he began to preach Christ, as he pathetically reminds the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/acts/9-24.htm">Acts 9:24</a>). In trying to imagine how this gainsayer could have given the least colour of probability to so audacious an assertion, we may suppose that he would point to St. Paul's behaviour at Jerusalem, and no doubt elsewhere, when he "to the Jews became as a Jew; to those under the Law as under the Law" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>); and in all probability, as Chrysostom and others have observed, cited the well-known fact of his circumcising Timothy; and there doubtless were other facts of a similar complexion, all which, with a little distortion, might enable an unscrupulous or a merely very eager opponent to dress up a statement like that before us with a certain amount of plausibleness. <span class="cmt_word">Why do I yet suffer persecution?</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>;); <span class="accented">why am I still persecuted</span>? The apostle distinctly implies <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that his persecutions were mainly occasioned by the hostility of the Jews; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the hostility of the Jews mainly originated in his teaching the doctrine that the cross of Christ put circumcision, together with the observance of the Law of Moses, aside as terms of acceptance with God. The first point is fully borne out by the history of the Acts and various allusions in the Epistles, showing that the fact was so, both before and after the time when this letter was written. The second is perfectly consistent with the history, and alone fully explains it. <span class="cmt_word">Then is the offence of the</span> <span class="cmt_word">cross ceased</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">then the stumbling-block of the cross hath been done away.</span> The stumbling-block of the cross is that which makes the cross a stumbling-block. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a> "Christ crucified" is designated as "to the Jews a stumbling-block;" while to Gentiles it simply seemed "folly." "Then" follows up an argument ex <span class="accented">absurdo</span>, as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 18</a>. The apostle means that the cross would not be to Jews the stumbling-block that it was if it had been preached in conjunction with the obligatoriness of circumcision together with the observance of the ceremonial law, upon those who believed in Christ. If, then, he had preached Christ crucified thus, he could not have been so offensive to the Jews. But it was all otherwise. It has been supposed that the notion of a crucified Messiah was offensive to Jewish feeling, merely because it ran counter to their conception of the Christ as a secular king and conqueror. St. Paul's words show that this was not the case. That preconception of the Jews no doubt made it <span class="accented">difficult</span> to them to believe in the Jesus whose worldly career had been closed by an early violent death; even as before our Lord's passion it had made it difficult to the apostles to believe that he was thus to die. But after the question whether the Christ was predestined to be a suffering Christ (<a href="../../par/acts/26-23.htm">Acts 26:23</a>) had been discussed, and it had been shown from the Old Testament that the Messiah was to suffer before he should reign, it had yet to be determined in what relation the particular form of Jesus' death stood with respect to the Mosaic Law. Gentiles would naturally think of the cross chiefly, indeed solely, as a sign of extremest ignominy; they thought scorn of the Christians who looked for life from "this Master of theirs, who was crucified" (Lucian). But to Jews, with the habits of feeling to which they had been trained in the school of Moses' Law, the cross was more than a sign of extremest ignominy - to them it was a sign also of extremest pollutedness. Now, to the Apostle Paul it had been given to see, with more distinctness than the general body of  believers at Jerusalem appear to have seen it, the inference to which the finger of Divine providence pointed in the particular form of death which, in the counsels of God, had been selected for the Christ to suffer (cf. <a href="../../par/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>). He had seen that faith in the crucified Saviour, by just consequence and in the Divine purpose, disconnected those, who embraced it as the supreme element of spiritual life, from all obligation to the ceremonial law as viewed in relation to their acceptance with God (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a>, and note). And because he held forth this truth, and insisted upon its vital importance in determining the mutual relations of Jew and Gentile in the Christian Church, therefore it was that he drew upon himself the peculiar unrelenting enmity with which the Jews pursued him. They could manage to live on terms of peace with their fellow-Jews at Jerusalem who held that the Christ predicted in the Old Testament was to be, in the first instance, a suffering Christ, and trusted in Jesus as fulfilling those predictions; for they saw that they, while believing in Jesus, continued, as St. James told St. Paul all of them did, to Observe and to be zealous for the Law (<a href="../../par/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>); they were able, therefore, in some degree to tolerate their "heresy." But St. Paul was led by the Saviour of all the world to adopt a different line. The truth, which lay wrapped up in the manner of Christ's death, and which at Jerusalem was left, so to speak, in its latency, it became necessary for the welfare of mankind that Paul should bring forth into view, and apply for the doing of the work which it was designed to accomplish. The cross annihilated the obligatoriness upon God's people of the Law of Moses. And, by teaching this, this apostle revived against himself the animosity which had flamed forth so fiercely upon St. Stephen, who was charged with saying that "Jesus the Nazarene was to change the customs which Moses had delivered unto them." It illustrates the <span class="accented">economy</span> which marks the Holy Spirit's development of revealed truth in the consciousness of the Church, that this consequence of the crucifixion of our Lord was for a while left so much in abeyance in the mother Church in Judaea. The fact stands on the same footing as the development of the doctrine of the essential Godhead of the Lord Jesus; for this too would seem to have been not at once and by an abrupt illumination brought distinctly home to the consciousness of the Hebrew Church, but to have been deposited like a seed in its bosom to unfold itself gradually. It seemed meet to the Divine Wisdom to cradle the infant faith tenderly, that it should not be exposed to too great risks through want of sympathy on the part of its first nursing mother towards these two of its most important elements. By-and-bye, when circumstances allowed, the same great apostle, who in his Epistle develops the doctrine of the cross in relation to Mosaism, could with advantage address the Hebrew Church, either himself or through another whom he inspired with his thoughts, that Epistle, in which the Godhead of Jesus is proclaimed with as much clearness and emphasis as the dissolution of the Mosaic institute in face of the new spiritual economy. The Epistle to the Hebrews, however, in proving that the new covenant was superseding the old, does not lay the chief stress of the argument upon the Crucifixion, but upon the utter unavailingness of the Mosaic priestly functions for the clearing of the conscience as compared with the efficacy of Christ's one offering. Nevertheless,the other point is not altogether neglected; at least, a kindred argument is suggested in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10-13</a>, in which passage contact with Christ as suffering without the camp is spoken of as inferring a pollution which was incompatible with "serving the tabernacle." The "Cross" is definitely named only once, and that with relation to extreme" shame" attaching to it (<a href="../../par/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). In other Epistles which are certainly of St. Paul's own composition, the "cross" ]s mentioned in connection with the abrogation of the ceremonial law, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-16.htm">Ephesians 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>; but the manner in which it brought about this result is nowhere so plainly indicated as in this Epistle to the Galatians, in which "the cross" is the very key-note of the whole discussion. The flashing out of resentful feeling which we read in the next verse was probably in part evoked by the clear glimpse which the apostle this moment caught of the conscious <span class="accented">insincerity</span> of those seducers, shown in their making or adopting such an assertion respecting himself as he here rebuts, which facts proved to be so glaringly false.

The tone of especially fervid aspiration, the vivacity, which usually marks wishes introduced by <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is perhaps unduly tamed down by the rendering "I would that."

Gesenius's 'Thesaurus,' and Furst, under <span class="accented">shophkah</span>). "This meaning is assigned to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>," observes Bishop Lightfoot, "by all the Greek commentators, I believe, without exception (the Latin Fathers, who read ' abseimtantur' in their text had more latitude), and seems alone tenable." (See Grotius, in Peele's ' Synopsis.' ) This interpretation gives its full force to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> ("not only circumcise, but even," etc.): it explains the form of the aspiration as one not likely to be realized; whereas the excision from the Church of these extremely aberrant members, falling nearly if not quite under the <span class="accented">anathema</span> of the first chapter, was a thing quite within the apostle's own power: it harmonizes with the intense resentment which colours the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (see below). The sentiment, it is true, seems one which it would be impossible for a public speaker, or even a writer, amongst ourselves to give such open expression to. Nevertheless, when viewed as framed in amid the surroundings which environed it at the time, it wears none of that aspect of coarseness which would confessedly be felt to attach to it under the conditions of modern life. That the worship of Cybele at Pessinus, one of the principal cities of Galatia, was deformed by the practice of such self-mutilation on the part of some of its devotees, was a matter of universal notoriety, and we may confidently assume that the apostle, when in the neighbourhood, heard frequent mention of those <span class="accented">apocopi</span> as they were called, and thus was led now to allude to it as he seems to do in this malediction. For it <span class="accented">is</span> a malediction, as Chrysostom describes it; a malediction, however, which in severity falls far short of the anathema which has been previously pronounced. Good were it (he means) for the Church, and even perhaps themselves, if they would have the rashness to go a little further with what they call "circumcision," which in their case is mere <span class="accented">concision</span> (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>), and make it clear to all men how purely senseless and unchristian their action in this matter is. "Casting you out of country and home." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs besides only in <a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a> ("turned upside down" ) and <a href="../../par/acts/21-38.htm">Acts 21:38</a> ("madest an uproar" ). It is not found in classical Greek, in which we have in its stead <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>: the verbal adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, when it is applied, as it frequently is, to populations, meaning, "made to rise up and depart," "driven from house and home;" applied to cities, "ruined," "laid waste" (Liddell and Scott). Chrysostom observes, "Well does he say, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>: for they compelled them to abandon their own proper country and liberty and heavenly kindred, and to seek an alien and strange one; casting them out of ' Jerusalem which is above and free,' and forcing them to wander abroad as captives and perforce emigrants." The present tense of the participle points to the action of these perverters as one which. if successful, would have this result; which (ver. 10) the apostle hopes to defeat. The selection of this particular verb, which goes far beyond the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> before used, and which the word "unsettle" adopted here by the Revisers, does not, as commonly used, completely represent, betokens the apostle's intense feeling of the ruinous consequences of the proposed Judaizing reaction. It shows that he adds the words <span class="accented">aetiologically</span>, that is, to justify his strong words, <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The energy of both expressions suggests the feeling that probably the apostle would not have written as he has here done except for his burning resentment on behalf of Christ's people threatened with so great a hurt. In 1 Car. 6:4 indignant feeling carries him away beyond himself to an utterance which in the next verse he virtually retracts, remarking, "I say it to move you to shame." Perhaps we have here something of the same kind.

This, of course, was that condition of free men described at the end of the foregoing chapter, and summarized in the first verse of this chapter. This is again, even more briefly, recapitulated in the first clause of the present verse. As the summary in the first verse supplied a starting-point for the warnings against the Judaizers which have taken up the foregoing twelve verses, so this new summary furnishes the starting-point for exhortations designed to guard the evangelical doctrine against antinomian perversion, by insisting upon the moral behaviour required of those who enjoy the freedom which Christ gives. These exhortations occupy the remainder of this chapter and a part of the next. "Ye," being what ye are, believers baptized into Christ. The verb "were called" expresses a complete idea, meaning of itself without any adjunct, "called by God to be people of his own" (cf. "calleth," ver. 8, and the passages there cited). The words, "unto," or "for, freedom," supply an adjunct notion; as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4</a>, the clause, "in one hope of your calling," does to the same verb. So again <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:7</a>," For God called us, not unto [or, 'for' ] uncleanness, but in sanctification.' 'The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, both in the passage last cited and in the present verse, denotes the condition or understanding upon which God had called them: they were "called" upon the understanding that they should be in a state of liberty. So <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "Created in Christ Jesus unto ['Greek,' for] good works."

In his eagerness to at once bar the antinomian's abuse of the gospel, the apostle omits the verb which should account for this accusative; and the result is a sentence which may be taken as grouping with various passages in classical Greek authors, being in fact quite a natural way of speaking in any language; such as in Demosthenes, ' Philippians,' 1. p. 45, "No ten thousand mercenaries for me! (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>);" Sophocles, ' Ant.,' 573, "No more loiterings! but...

In such cases it simply weakens the vivacity of the style, if we supply any verb.

Reflection at once shows us that a "<span class="accented">freedom"</span> which allows a man to obey the behests of his lower nature is only by a false use of the term capable of being grouped with that freedom wherewith Christ makes us free. It adopts out of the latter the single element of emancipation from ceremonial law and letter-Law, and lets go altogether the concomitant notions of spiritual emancipation which are of its very essence. Such an emancipation hands its victim clean over to the thraldom of sin (<a href="../../par/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18, 19</a>). St. Peter, in his First Epistle, addressed to a large group of Churches founded by St. Paul, including those of Galatia, has a number of passages which apparently take up sentiments and even expressions found in St. Paul's writings (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>), as it were, ratifying them; and possibly he has an eye to the present verse when he writes (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>), "as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of <span class="accented">wickedness</span>, but as bond-servants of God." "The flesh" is not to have its own way, but is to own the mastery of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">But by love serve one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but through love be in bondage to one another</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> let love make you bondservants to one another. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> also means "do acts of bond-service,' as <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>. This sense is included in the "being in bondage ' here spoken cf. In the present posture of affairs in these Churches, the apostle sees occasion for selecting just here one particular branch of Christian goodness to enforce upon their observance. Presently after (vers. 16-20 he enlarges the field of view; though even there still giving much prominence to the vices of malignity and to the benignant virtues. Just now he has his eye especially on the evils of contentiousness (ver. 15), and upon love as their corrective. We may  suppose such evils were now especially rife amongst the Galatians, whose natural character, commonly described as quarrelsome, was apparently evincing itself in connection with the disputes which the teaching and yet more the outward action of the Judaizers were giving rise to. In fact, a loving temper of mind, along with other benefits, is recommended also by this, that it guards Churches from corrupting innovations in doctrine and Church practice; checking our self-will and our obtrusive vanity, it leads us to avoid giving uneasiness to others by thrusting upon them new notions or new modes of conduct, and makes it our ambition to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. The pattern set by our Lord (<a href="../../par/john/13-15.htm">John 13:15</a>), both in washing his disciples' feet and indeed in his whole incarnate life (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>), was grandly imitated by the apostle himself (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-19.htm">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>), who in outward things habitually sacrificed the pride of independence and self-assertion, and the pride of apparent self-consistency, in his devotion to the spiritual welfare of men. He here preaches just what he himself practised.

Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: love therefore is the fulfilment (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the Law." This passage of the Romans may be regarded as a lengthened paraphrase of the one now before us. From the comparison of the two, several things are made clear. We see from it what is meant by the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "hath been fulfilled." Some have been disposed to regard it as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "it is summed up." Not to urge that it is very doubtful whether the verb admits of this sense, it is enough to observe that in the parallel passage the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, both in <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>, hath fulfilled, and the verbal <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, fulfilment, means to fulfil in <span class="accented">actual</span> obedience; and that the perfect tense of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of this passage reappears in the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span> of the other. The sentence in Romans, "He that loveth his neighbour (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) hath fulfilled the Law," that is, as the context shows, "the whole Law," makes it clear that, by the words before us, "the whole Law hath been fulfilled in one word," is meant that the whole Law hath been fulfilled in the fulfilling of the one word, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." The whole Law is regarded as couched in that "one word." In the larger passage the Law, so far as it is explained, is represented as regulating our behaviour to our neighbours, for the apostle cites exclusively commandments of the "second table;" in addition to which, we observe that the immediately preceding context (vers. 1-7) is taken up with the discussion of duties to our fellow-men, sliding into what follows through the words, "Owe no man anything, save to love one another." This suggests the inference that when the apostle says, "He that loveth hath fulfilled the Law;" and at the close of the paragraph, "Love is the fulfilment of the Law," he has in view that part only of the Law which enforces the duties appertaining to human relationships, and not the whole Law as enforcing, together with these, the duties we owe to God; for "love," he says, "his the fulfilment of the Law, <span class="accented">because</span> it worketh no evil <span class="accented">to his neighbour."</span> And this might seem further to justify the like inference with reference to the passage before us; and here also the immediate context (ver. 13) points only to relations between man and man, making no reference to our relations towards God. And this inference we seem warranted in accepting. Only, we have to bear in mind that the apostle has already taken account of our spiritual relations to God, in stating (ver. 6) that in Christ Jesus the all-important and only thing is faith working through love. For the faith which he means is plainly the principle which unites the soul to Christ Jesus, and in him to God as our reconciled Father, through the vitalizing and actuating power of the Spirit of adoption. And precisely the same consideration presents itself with respect to the parallel passage in the Romans; for there, too, the apostle has been previously engaged in building up the gospel doctrine of Christ's redeeming us from the control of a condemning Law, which is also mere "letter," and can give no spiritual life; and of his handing us over to the law of the Spirit of life, whereby the requirement of the Law is fulfilled in them who walk, not after the flesh, but after the Spirit (<a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>). The apostle takes it for granted that it is with these views in their minds that his readers will receive what he here writes. Further, account is to be  taken of the spiritual sense in which the apostle uses the terms "law" and "love." Under the term "law" he no longer intends the Law of Moses, either as a ceremonial institute or as a letter-Law regulating moral behaviour; but that higher and spiritual law, of which the precepts of the letter-Law are only incomplete hints or adumbrations - the good and acceptable and perfect will of God (<a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). Likewise, by the term "love" he designates a very different thing from that principle of kindness, good nature, benevolence, which an Aristotle or Cicero, an Epictetus or Plutarch, could conceive and describe, and in their own practice exemplify; with St. Paul, as with St. John, it is a fruit of the Spirit, an emanation of Christ's life in the soul, organically and vitally ramifying out of filial love to God. They that were in the flesh <span class="accented">could</span> not please God. In order that we may fulfil the Law, the prime and indispensable requisite is that the Spirit of Christ be dwelling in us and leading us.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span>, utterly destroy, occurs besides only in <a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a> and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>, of destruction by fire or lightning; so the compound <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>. It points to another sphere of hurt than that referred to in the two foregoing verbs; for while these latter describe the eager endeavour to sting and "run down" a theological opponent, the former describes the utter laying waste of the inward life of piety. The orthodox opinion may survive, and perhaps be even made clearer and more accurate; but the kernel of filial love and joy in God, and of love towards our brethren, may by the <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, the bitter antagonism, of controversy have got to be altogether eaten out.

It points back to the line of remark commenced in ver. 13 in the words, "No freedom to be an occasion to the flesh! but through love be in bondage one to another." The voluntary bondage of love is one most important part of the spiritual life; as indulgence in malignant passions is also a leading branch of the working of the flesh. The mention, therefore, of these two points in vers. 14, 15 naturally leads up to the more general exhortation of the present passage. <span class="cmt_word">Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil</span> (or, <span class="accented">fulfil not</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the lust of the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">walk by the Spirit</span>, <span class="accented">and ye shall not fulfil the lust</span> (or, <span class="accented">desire</span>) <span class="accented">of the flesh.</span> The precise meaning of the several words and statements in this verse, as also in the two which follow it, have been much disputed. It must suffice here briefly to explain and justify what appears to the present writer the true view. The word "spirit," it seems most natural to understand in all three in the same sense. To take it in the first two verses as meaning that part of our composite being which has the nearest affinity to the higher moral and spiritual life (whether as in a state of nature or as informed by the Spirit of God), whilst in ver. 18 its import is determined by comparison with other passages to be the Divine Spirit, appears to be an arbitrary variation of its sense, which there is no necessity for adopting. The "Spirit" is mentioned alongside with "the flesh," not because it belongs to the like category of being a part of our nature, but because he has been graciously sent forth by God to contravene in us that evil principle which else we should be unable to overcome. This evil principle is termed "the flesh;" not as being merely <span class="accented">sensual</span> corruption, though vices of that class are mentioned in vers. 19 and 21 as leading instances of its working; for we see in vers. 20 and 21 vicious works of the flesh specified, which are to be referred to malignity (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>), or to a perversion of the religious element, rather than to sensuality. It appears, therefore, to denote the principle of corruption which taints our moral nature in general - that which in the ninth of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England is deflated under the heading of "Original or Birth-Sin.' The word "flesh" may be supposed to have been selected to denote this, because the depravation of our sensuous beings into sensuality constituted the most prominent and noticeable form in which the general degradation of our state from its proper nobler life in God manifests itself. The dative case of <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, marks <span class="accented">- either</span> the sphere, element, path, in which we are to walk, which is intended by  the rendering in our Authorized Version, "in the Spirit," as the dative is used with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (Authorized Version, "walk" ) in <a href="../../par/acts/9-31.htm">Acts 9:31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-16.htm">Acts 14:16</a>, and with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, walk, in <a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-18.htm">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>; or the rule <span class="accented">according to</span> which, together with the enabling power <span class="accented">by</span> which, our daily behaviour is to be regulated, so as to be synonymous with the phrase, "walking after (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>) the Spirit," in <a href="../../par/romans/8-4.htm">Romans 8:4</a>. The meaning at all events seems to be, Let the prompting of the Spirit be your guide, and the grace of the Spirit your strength, in the course of your life continually. This is afterwards expressed as being "led by the Spirit" (ver. 18), and as an "orderly walking by the Spirit' (ver. 25). The exhortation implies two things: first, that the Christians addressed, had had the gift of the Holy Spirit imparted to them (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/3-2.htm">Galatians 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/4-6.htm">Galatians 4:6</a>, where" our hearts" includes the persons addressed; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>); and next, that this gift would not avail for the actual sanctification of their life without diligent endeavours after self-improvement on their own part. Comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>, "Work out your own salvation [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> by your own endeavours work out your salvation] with fear and trembling; for it is God which worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure." The generality of the form in which the exhortation is couched intimates that they were to endeavour to live in compliance with the Spirit's promptings in all the branches of spiritual activity proper to their Christian calling; not only in that of "love" already adverted to, but in those others also which the apostle presently after counts up in vers. 22, 23. It inculcates, therefore, the cultivation of a joyous spirit of filial love towards God, as well as a high strain of virtuous conduct towards their fellow-men and in relation to their own selves. In the next clause, the words, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "ye shall not fulfil." are by many (see margin of our Authorized Version)taken in an imperative sense; as if it were, walk by the Spirit, and by no means fulfil the desire of the flesh. It is, however, with much force objected to this view that, although the future with <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> is often used for an imperative, as <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, etc., there is no instance adduced of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> being used in the New Testament in this sense. We are led, therefore, to adopt the other view, that the passage belongs to that form of sentence in which an imperative clause is followed by a clause denoting the result which will ensue in case the direction before given has been complied with; <span class="accented">as e.g.</span> "<span class="accented">Come</span> unto me... and I will give you rest." In place of the simple <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, we have the more emphatic form, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "Of a surety ye will not," etc. By writing thus the apostle strongly accentuates the statement that walking by the Spirit is absolutely incompatible with an indulgence in the inclinations prompted by the flesh. There is probably a twofold doctrinal inference couched under this emphatic statement; namely, Ye will of a surety not fall under the Law's condemnation (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>); and, Ye will not need the Law's restraints (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>). But it is pregnant also with a hint of rebuke and of practical direction, not unneeded by the Galatians (ver. 15). The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, probably because it is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/11-50.htm">Luke 11:50</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6</a>; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, etc.; so that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> is put for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is selected in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) to express the idea that it is impossible for one walking by the Spirit to <span class="accented">carry into full effect</span> any desire of the flesh. For this is the proper force of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, of which the ever-memorable <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "It is finished" (<a href="../../par/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>), is a typical illustration. This meaning obtains even in <a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28</a> and <a href="../../par/james/2-8.htm">James 2:8</a>. The apostle seems to concede that the desire of the flesh may be felt by one who is walking by the Spirit; nay, even in at least an inchoate degree, given way to; but this much he affirms, that it will be impossible for such a one to ear,' y it out into full accomplishment. This qualified representation of the Christian's holiness is intimated in the next verse more explicitly.

Then the apostle adds, "<span class="accented">but</span> the Spirit <span class="accented">likewise</span> [or, ' <span class="accented">hath desires</span> ] against the flesh;" intimating that, although the flesh was still at work within, prompting desires tending away from holiness, <span class="accented">that</span> nevertheless was no reason for their giving way to such evil inclinations; for the Spirit was with them as well, originating desires after what was holy and good; and he would help them against those other inclinations towards evil, if only they would surrender themselves to his guidance. That this is the proper way of construing these two passages  seems betokened by the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. If the apostle had just here meant to say, "There are two mutually opposing principles at work within you" for the purpose of justifying by explicit statement the tone of ver. 16 which <span class="accented">implies</span> this fact, he would have written, <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3c2;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: or, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3be;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> etc.; "For both hath the flesh desires against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh; or, "for on the one hand the flesh hath desires... and on the other," etc. But the adversative <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> standing alone tends to disjoin the two clauses rather than to conjoin them so closely together as the Authorized Version leads us to suppose. We need supply no ether verb than <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, "hath desires," with the words, "but the Spirit;" for this verb is used in a good sense as well as in a bad; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/luke/22-15.htm">Luke 22:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "with desire did I desire;" <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>, "the angels desire (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) to look into;" <a href="../../par/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>. "the desire (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) to depart." In fact, the verb properly implies a simply <span class="accented">strong</span> wish, not necessarily an ill-governed one. <span class="cmt_word">And these are</span> <span class="cmt_word">contrary the one to the other</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented">for these oppose themselves the one to the other.</span> Taking the former two clauses as has been proposed above, we can discern the force of the "for" introducing this new clause. The apostle having been by two several turns of thought led to state, first that the flesh prompts desires or action in opposition to the Spirit, and then, as a distinct sentence, that the Spirit prompts desires or action in opposition to the flesh, he now conjoins the two several notions in the affirmation of the mutual antagonistic agency of these two principles; "For these oppose themselves the one to the other." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> always denotes opposing action, and not mere contrariety of nature; being used as a participial noun for "adversaries" or "opponents' ' in <a href="../../par/luke/13-17.htm">Luke 13:17</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/21-15.htm">Luke 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-9.htm">1 Corinthians 16:9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5.htm">1 Timothy 5</a>. i4; and as a verb in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-4.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a> and <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, to denote setting one's self in opposition to. This clause, therefore, describes the continual endeavour of the flesh and of the Spirit to thwart and defeat each other's action in the hearts of the persons spoken cf. <span class="cmt_word">So that</span> <span class="cmt_word">ye cannot do the things that ye would</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1fb3;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">to the end that what things soever ye fain would do</span>, <span class="accented">those ye shall not</span> do. This last clause describes the <span class="accented">result aimed at</span> by each of those conflicting principles, namely, to thwart each of them the volitions prompted by the other. The words remind us of <a href="../../par/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "For not, what thing I fain would,that do I practise;" ibid., 16, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span>, "What thing I fain would not, that I do;" ibid., 19, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, "For not what good thing I fain would, do I do; but what evil thing I fain would not, that I practise." The comparison of the indefinite relative, "what things soever ye fain would do (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>)," in the present passage, with the more definite "what thing I fain would do," or "fain would not do (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>)," in the Romans, points to the conclusion that by the clause, "what things soever ye fain would do," is meant, "whichever be the kind of your volitions, whether they be those prompted by the flesh or those prompted by the Spirit." In comparing the two passages, it is important to notice that in the seventh chapter of the Romans the apostle is Concerned exclusively with the frustration of our <span class="accented">good</span> volitions, which, there, are not ascribed to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, but to the prompting of our own moral sense quickened by the voice of the Law's commandment. Such good volitions he represents as overpowered by the controlling influence ("law" ) of the evil principle, "the flesh;" a condition of miserable thraldom, out of which, the apostle (ibid., 25), with triumphant gratitude, alludes to believers in Christ being delivered - delivered by the coming in upon the scene of a new agent, "the Spirit of life:" whereas, in the passage before us, he is describing the condition of believers in Christ, to whom now has been imparted this new power for doing what is good. In these, "the mind" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-25.htm">Romans 7:25</a>), powerless before to overcome the law of sin, is succoured by the presence of a mighty Ally, through whom, he intimates elsewhere, the believer has it within his power to do all things (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). Many expositors, in-eluding Bishop Lightfoot, take <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> in the present clause us denoting simply the result actually brought about; thus the Authorized Version, "so that ye cannot do the things that ye would." Whether this sense, of result actually produced, can be shown ever to attach to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> followed by the subjunctive, is a question which has been much debated. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4</a>, "Ye are not in darkness that (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) that day should overtake you as a thief," the particle "that" points to the ordering of Divine providence spoken of in the two preceding verses, that they who are in darkness <span class="accented">should</span> be taken by surprise by the coming of the day of the Lord. It is certainly possible so to understand the particle here; the mutually thwarting agency of the flesh and the Spirit may be understood as latently attributed to Divine providence ordering that thus it should be. But this view would  hardly seem to harmonize, either with the almightiness of the Divine Agent engaged in the conflict or with the triumphant language of <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>. In actual experience, it does indeed seem to be but too often almost a <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> a drawn battle; so greatly is the Spirit's agency dogged and hampered by the weakness of human faith and the inconstancy of human purpose. But it does not need to be so. In the case of St. Paul himself, as we may infer from all that he says of his own career subsequent to his conversion, and in perhaps not a few cases besides, the Spirit has been completely and persistently triumphant. It therefore appears inconvenient to suppose that the apostle means to ascribe such a result to the ordering of Divine providence making it inevitable. Certainly such a construction of the passage is not necessary. We escape from it altogether by ascribing the notion of purpose latent in this <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "to the end that," to the nisus severally of the two agents. Taken so, the passage affirms this: Will whatever you may, whether good or evil, you will be sure to meet with an adverse agency, striving to bar the complete accomplishment of your desire. There appears to be no good reason for limiting the application of this statement, as some propose our doing, to the case of immature Christians, in whom Christ is as yet imperfectly formed (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-19.htm">Galatians 4:19</a>). With every Christian, to the very last, the life of holiness can only be a fruit of <span class="accented">conflict</span>; a conflict on the whole, even perhaps persistently, successful; yet a conflict still, maintained by the help of the Spirit against an evil principle, which can never, as long as we live, cease to give occasion for care and watchfulness (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24-27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-12.htm">1 Timothy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). Why, it may be asked, is the apostle concerned to refer to this conflict here? Apparently because the Galatians showed by their behaviour that they needed to be stirred up and put upon their guard. They were, as the apostle (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>) told the Corinthian believers <span class="accented">they</span> were, "carnal, walking as men." They had foregone the sense of their adoption; they were worrying one another with contentions. The flesh was in their case manifestly thwarting and defeating the desires of the Spirit. Therefore the apostle here reminds them of the conditions of the Christian life; it is to stimulate them to that earnest endeavour to walk by the Spirit, without which (ver. 24) they could not be Christ' s.

The dative case with <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in both passages is illustrated by <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>, "silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." In all three cases the dative must be the dative of the agent, there being in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a> a slight personification. This use of the dative is not in prose writers a common construction with passive verbs, though not altogether unknown (Winer, ' Gram. N.T.,' &sect; 3l, 10). In the present case its harshness is perhaps relieved by the circumstance that the noun does not represent an agent whose personality is markedly conspicuous <span class="accented">ab extra</span>; but rather an internally swaying influence, whoso personality is a matter of faith. Hence in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a> we render, "led away <span class="accented">with</span> divers lusts." This shade of sense might be represented by rendering, "led with the Spirit." In <a href="../../par/luke/4-1.htm">Luke 4:1</a>, "led by the Spirit," we have <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>. In all these passages the passive, "being led," must, from the nature of the case, include the voluntary self-subjection of those led. In Romans," being led by the Spirit" stands instead of "walking after the Spirit" in ver. 4; "being after the Spirit" in ver. 5; "by the Spirit mortifying the deeds of the body" in ver. 13. Similarly, here it is tantamount to the "walking by the Spirit" mentioned above in ver. 16. The phrase cannot be fairly understood of merely having that <span class="accented">presence</span> of the Holy Spirit. which is predicated of the whole "body of Christ," even of those members thereof whose conduct is plainly not regulated by the sacred influence (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>); it must be understood as describing the case of such as recognize its presence and yield themselves to its guidance. The sense of the phrase, "being under the Law," is illustrated by <a href="../../par/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23</a>, "we were kept in ward under the Law;, <a href="../../par/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, "made to be under the Law;" ibid., 5, "to redeem those which were under the Law;" ibid., 21, "ye who would fain be under the Law;" <a href="../../par/romans/6-14.htm">Romans 6:14, 15</a>, "not under the Law, but under grace;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-20.htm">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>, "to those which are under the Law as under the Law, that I might gain those who are under the Law." These are all the passages in which the expression occurs. The inference is clear that the apostle designates by it the condition of such as are subject to the Law of the old covenant, viewed as a whole, in its ceremonial aspect as well as its moral; his meaning would not be exhausted by the paraphrase, "subject to the condemnation of the Law." What he affirms here is this: If in the course of your lives you are habitually swayed by the inward motions of the Spirit of God, then you  are not subject to the Law of the old covenant. The connection between the premiss and the conclusion has been clearly shown by the apostle above (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-5.htm">Galatians 4:5-7</a>), it is this, that the possession of the Spirit of adoption proves a man to be a "son" - one who has attained his majority and is no longer subject to a <span class="accented">pedagogue.</span> This aphorism of the apostle, that <span class="accented">if</span> they were led by the Spirit they were not under the Law, suggests the inquiry - But how was it with those Christians who were <span class="accented">not</span> led by the Spirit? Would the apostle teach, or would he allow us to say, that Gentile Christians (for it is to such that he is writing), and Jewish as well, if not guided by the Spirit, <span class="accented">were</span> bound to obey the Law of the old covenant? With reference to this point we are to consider that the apostle has elsewhere clearly stated, for example in <a href="../../par/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>, that the Church of God forms, in solidarity with Israel of old, one "Israel of God," as he speaks in the sixth chapter of this Epistle (ver. 16); Gentiles, being "grafted in" upon the original stock, have thus become branches (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) having one common life and nature therewith; or, in the language of another figure, "fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus," with those who originally were heirs and forming the body and partners in the promised blessing (<a href="../../par/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6</a>). This leads us to the view that God's Law, the revelation of his will relative to his people's conduct, given in successive developments - patriarchal, Mosaical, prophetical - is, with such modifications as have been made by the crucifixion and the priesthood of Christ, and by the mission and work of the Holy Spirit, God's Law relative to his people's conduct still. The cross and priestly work of Christ, as we are taught by this Epistle and the Epistle to the Hebrews, do for all Christians eliminate from this Law its ceremonial prescriptions altogether; but its moral prescriptions, more fully perfected by the moral teaching of Jesus and his apostles, are still incumbent upon them. Those Christians who really give themselves up to the Spirit to be taught and animated by him, who are as St. Paul says (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>) "spiritual," these use this Law (as Calvin phrases it) as a <span class="accented">doctrina liberalis</span>; the Law of the Spirit of life within them leads and enables them to recognize, and so to speak assimilate, the kindred import of the Law embodied in the letter; which thus ministers to their instruction and consolation (<a href="../../par/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-10.htm">1 Corinthians 9:10</a>). The letter of the Law is now their helper, no longer their absolute rigid rule; as a rule it is superseded by the law written in the heart (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-6.htm">2 Corinthians 3:6-11</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8-11</a>). As Chrysostom writes in his note on the present passage, "They are raised to a height far above the Law's injunction." But in the degree in which they axe not spiritual, but natural (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a>; <a href="../../par/jude/1-19.htm">Jude 1:19</a>), in that degree must they use the letter of the Law, in the New Testament as well as the Old, as the rule of their conduct. We, those who have been sacramentally brought into covenant with God, cannot be left to ourselves; either we must be sweetly, persuasively, instinctively, swayed by the Spirit of God within, or else own the coercing dominion of the written Law. In fact, the same individual Christian may at different times be subject to alternation between these two diverse phases of experience, passing over from one to the other of them according to his fluctuating needs. Christians may, therefore, be broadly divided into three classes: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the spiritual (<a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those who are as yet in bondage to the letter; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> those who are living after the flesh - "carnal" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>). <p>The above statement of the case commends itself as in accordance with what the apostle writes in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-8.htm">1 Timothy 1:8-11</a>, "We know that the Law is good [<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: cf. <a href="../../par/romans/7-12.htm">Romans 7:12</a>] if a man use it lawfully [<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, according to the manner in which God has directed us to use it in his gospel (ver. 11)], knowing this [having his eye upon this], that the Law is not made (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for,.., according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God." In contrast with this Law, coercing impiety and immorality wherever it is found, whether in the world or in the Church, the apostle has before in ver. 5 declared that its function is superseded in the case of the spiritual believer: "The end of the commandment [see Alford] is charity, out of a pure heart and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned." The perpetual obligation of the Law given under the old covenant, subject to the qualifications noted above, appears to be emphatically affirmed by our Lord: "I came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil: for verily I say unto you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the Law, till all things be accomplished" (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17, 18</a>). And the recognition of this principle underlies all his moral teaching; as, for example, in the sermon on the mount; in his controversies with the Jewish rabbins; in such passages as <a href="../../par/mark/10-19.htm">Mark 10:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>. The moral Law given in the Old Testament amalgamates itself with that given in the New, forming one whole. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <i>these</i>; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the works of the flesh are manifest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). The apostle's purpose is here altogether one of practical exhortation. Having in ver. 13  emphatically warned the Galatians against making their emancipation from the Mosaic Law an occasion for the flesh, and in ver. 16 affirmed the incompatibility of a spiritual walk with the fulfilment of the desire of the flesh, he now specifies samples of the vices, whether in outward conduct or in inward feeling, in which the working of the flesh is apparent, as if cautioning them; adducing just those into which the Galatian converts would naturally be most in danger of falling. Both in the list which he gives them of .,ins, and in that of Christian graces, he is careful to note those relative to their Church life as well as those bearing upon their personal private life. Instances of enumeration of sins which may be compared with that here given, are found, with respect to the heathen world, in <a href="../../par/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29-31</a>; with reference to Christians, <a href="../../par/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3-5</a>, followed by a brief indication of fruits of the Spirit in ver. 9; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2-4</a>. "Manifest;" namely, to our moral sense; we at once feel that these are the outcome of an evil nature, and are incompatible with the influence of the Spirit of God. "Works of the flesh" means works in which the prompting of the flesh is recognizable. The phrase is equivalent to "the deeds or doings of the body," which we are called to "mortify, put to death, by the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>). In <a href="../../par/romans/13-12.htm">Romans 13:12</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-13.htm">Ephesians 5:13</a> they are styled "works of darkness," that is, works belonging properly to a state in which the moral sense has not been quickened by the Spirit, or in which the light of Christ's presence has not shone. Which are these (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">of which sort are.</span> Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>], <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>). This is the first group, consisting of offences against <span class="accented">chastity - sins</span> against which the Church has to contend in all ages and in all countries; but which idolatry, especially such idolatry as that of Cybele in Galatia, has generally much fostered. The first in our English Bible, "<span class="accented">adultery</span>," <span class="accented">is</span> rejected from the Greek text by the general consent of editors. But in fact, "<span class="accented">fornication"</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) may be taken as including it (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>), though it may also stand at its side as a distinct species of unchastity. "<span class="accented">uncleanness"</span> covers a wider range of sensual sin ("all uncleanness," <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>); solitary impurity, whether in thought or deed; unnatural lust (<a href="../../par/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>), though it can hardly be taken as meaning this lust alone. "Lasciviousness," or "<span class="accented">wantonness</span>," is scarcely an adequate rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> in this connection; it appears to point to reckless <span class="accented">shamelessness</span> in unclean indulgences. In classical Greek the adjective <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> describes a man insolently and wantonly reckless in his treatment of others; but in the New Testament it generally appears to point more specifically to unabashed open indulgence in impurity. The noun is connected with "uncleanness" and "fornication' 'in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>; with "uncleanness' ' in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-19.htm">Ephesians 4:19</a>; is used of the men of Sodom in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-7.htm">2 Peter 2:7</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-18.htm">2 Peter 2:18</a>; l Peter 4:3; <a href="../../par/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a> (cf. 7). Only in <a href="../../par/mark/7-22.htm">Mark 7:22</a> can it from the grouping be naturally taken in its classical sense.

We may compare, "in respect to the former, the temptations which the apostle recognizes the danger of in the case of the Corinthians (1 Corinthians rift. and 10.). "Sorcery." The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, originally denoting the use of drugs merely, means, sometimes, their use for poisoning; but this sense would not be very suitable here.

This vice of our nature, so inveterate in our fallen state - the antithesis to the love which  is the essence of goodness - is, strangely enough as it at first sight seems, most readily stimulated into rancour by differences in religion. As at this very same time at Corinth, so here in Galatia likewise, the "flesh" displayed its malignity in "jealousy, strife, and divisions (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)," originating from this cause (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>).

The precise import of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, rendered "jealousy," is not easily determined. It is spoken of as a virtue in <a href="../../par/john/2-17.htm">John 2:17</a>, "the zeal of thine house;" <a href="../../par/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>, "zeal for God;" <a href="../../par/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>, "touching zeal, persecuting the Church;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:7</a>, "your fervent mind [or, 'your zeal'] for me;" ibid., ver. 11, "what zeal" But in perhaps all these cases, the ardent favouring of what is good is thought of as either ready to take, or actually taking, the aspect of <span class="accented">boiling</span> resentment against its assailants; thus also <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-27.htm">Hebrews 10:27</a> ("fiery indignation," Authorized Version), literally, "zeal of fire." So in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>, "zealous;" comp. <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "jealous God" (Authorized Version); Hebrews <span class="accented">el qanna</span> To this line of meaning is to be referred <a href="../../par/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "filled with indignation (<span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." In another class of passages the word denotes a wrong state of feeling, where in the Authorized Version it is uniformly rendered "envy" or "envying.' ' These are <a href="../../par/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a> (Revised Version, "jealousy" ), where it surely means the resentment which the Jews felt at the supposed invasion of their own theocratic prerogatives. In the remaining passages of the New Testament in which it occurs it is linked either with "strife," as it is here; namely, <a href="../../par/romans/13-13.htm">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; or with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="../../par/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14, 16</a>. In these passages there does not seem any reason on the face of them for supposing that it means "envy," that is, grudging to another some advantage; this in Greek is <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. A more probable view is that <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> denotes eagerness to find in another some ground for hot resentment against him. Perhaps we have no single equivalent word in our language, "jealousy" being the nearest approach. In the Epistle of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians, ch. 4-6, we have a long list of instances given of persons who have suffered through being objects of <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in many of them "envy," or "rivalry," would seem to be the more prominent notion in the word; but in others it appears to mean rather "jealousy;" in some the same as in <a href="../../par/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a> or Acts 13:45. The next word <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, wraths, denotes violent ebullitions of passionate anger; the plural pointing to different occasions prompting such. The following term, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (rendered "factious" ), was formerly imagined to be etymologically connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, strife - a notion which is now generally abandoned. The verb from which it is derived, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, is to act the part of an <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, day-labourer, the noun signifying "labour for hire;" then, scheming or intriguing for a post of employment; and next, "party-action," "the contentious spirit of faction., In the New Testament it occurs six times besides here. In <a href="../../par/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (Authorized Version, "them who are contentious" ), it appears to denote those who set themselves in factious opposition to the truth, the apostle having no doubt especially in his eye Jewish gainsayers of the gospel. In <a href="../../par/philippians/1-16.htm">Philippians 1:16</a>, "some preach Christ <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>," it points to factious opposition to Christ's divinely appointed heralds. In <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>, "let nothing be done <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>," the same sense of factious opposition to others is quite suitable. In the remaining passages, <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, come together as they do here, and <a href="../../par/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14-16</a>, where, as above noted, it is coujoined with <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the notion of "factiousness," or "faction," perfectly satisfies the context. In the present passage the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, denotes factious feelings roused on behalf of this cause and that; such sentiments as are likely to eventuate in <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, divisions, that is, more distinctly formed parties "standing apart" from each other; whilst these again culminate in <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, occurs also in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>, where they are spoken of as indicative of <span class="accented">a fleshly</span> mind. and in <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>, "Mark them which cause divisions and (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) occasions of stumbling." We may regard this word as standing in the same relation to <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">divisions</span>," or "schisms," do which are mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-18.htm">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>," When ye come together in the Church, I hear that <span class="accented">divisions</span> exist among you; and I partly believe it; for there must be also <span class="accented">heresies</span> among you." In endeavouring to ascertain the exact import of this last word (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), "heresies," we must first ascertain the sense in which <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> was currently used before it was employed to describe phenomena appearing in the Church. The proper sense of "<span class="accented">choice"</span> was in this word often limited to the specific sense of "<span class="accented">choice</span> of views," particularly in philosophy or religion; that is, it meant "ways of thinking;" and then,  by an easy transition, "those who followed a particular way of thinking"- "a school of thought." Thus it occurs in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, 'De Dora. et Arist.,' 7, etc. (see Liddell and Scott). This sense was so current in Dionysius's time as to appear in Latin in the contemporary writings of Cicero; thus, in 'Protein. Parad.,' Cicero writes, "Care in ea est haeresi [sc. the Stoic], quae nullum sequitur florem orationis;" 'Ad Famil.,' 15:16; 'Ad Att.,' 14:14. Similarly Vitruvius writes, 'Prier.,' 5, "Pythagorae haeresin sequi." It is not always easy to discriminate whether the "school of thought" so designated means the way of thinking itself or the set of men who held it. In this sense the word is used in the New Testament. Thus <a href="../../par/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a>, "the high priest and all they that were with him, which is the <span class="accented">heresy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of the Sadducees;" where it means the sect, and not their views. So again, <a href="../../par/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>, "certain of those of the <span class="accented">heresy</span> of the Pharisees;" ibid., 24.5, "ringleader of the <span class="accented">heresy</span> of the Nazaraeans," where Tertullus plainly meant those who held the views of the Nazaraeans, and not the views themselves. But, on the other hand, in the same chapter St. Paul in his reply (ver. 14), when he says, "After the way which they call a <span class="accented">heresy</span>, so serve I the God of our fathers," evidently uses the term as applying to "the Way" itself (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>), and not to the people who followed it. In <a href="../../par/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a>, "after the straitest <span class="accented">heresy</span> of our religion (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) I lived a Pharisee," the word may be taken either way. In <a href="../../par/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>. "concerning this <span class="accented">heresy</span>, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against," it seems, of the two, to be rather the more obvious way to take it of "what Paul thought," than of the persons so thinking. If, however, it be taken of persons, it is of course to be taken of them as holding and representing such views. In <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, "false teachers, who shall privily bring in <span class="accented">heresies</span> of perdition," the qualifying genitive, "of perdition," would seem to favour our understanding the "heresies" of the doctrines of these false teachers, rather than of the parties following their teaching. On the whole review of these passages, it is of the utmost importance to note the manner in which, in <a href="../../par/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>, etc., St. Paul treats Tertullus's application of the term to the Christian faith. "I confess," he says, "that after the way which they call <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the prophets: having hope towards God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust." In thus speaking, the apostle repudiates the application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> to the Christian faith; not, however, on the ground that the term denoted a flagrantly erroneous and vicious form of doctrine; for there is nothing to show that this was the idea which Tertullus meant to convey to Felix's mind, in so designating either Christians or their faith: what, indeed, should Felix care about the soundness or unsoundness of their doctrines? The apostle rather repudiates the term, because, as signifying" choice," it implied that the views referred to were adopted on the prompting of individual opinion or liking. That it was not this, he shows by referring partly to the broad basis of Divine revelation in general as propounding the doctrine of the resurrection, which lay at the foundation of the Christian faith; and partly to the fact that his accusers themselves admitted that doctrine. Christians believed that Jesus was raised from the dead, not because they "chose" to think so, but because God's Word taught them so to believe. We are thus landed at the conclusion that, antecedently to its introduction into the language of the Church, the term <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> denoted a school of thought or a set of opinions; sometimes the opinions them-solves; sometimes the people holding them; but that it was understood to do so with reference to points on which there did not appear to be any decisive authority to determine men's convictions, and respecting which, therefore, men might <span class="accented">choose</span> their own opinions as they thought themselves best able, This conclusion will help us to understand its import in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>, in the passage before us, and in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, as well as the passage in <a href="../../par/titus/3-10.htm">Titus 3:10, 11</a>, in which the case of "a man that is an heretic (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>)" is dealt with. It is clear, from <a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, that the apostle regarded the "gospel" which had been delivered to the world (<a href="../../par/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>) by himself and his fellow-apostles, as being a revelation so certain and authoritative that any teacher introducing doctrine seriously infringing upon its substantial import would subject himself to the extreme malediction of God. The whole tenor of this Epistle shows that its author considered the Churches of Galatia as at this very time in danger of either producing from their own bosom, or else admitting from the teaching of others, doctrine which would be thus fatally subversive of the truth. Was it not, then, extremely probable that, when here enumerating, with an especial eye to the case of the Churches he was addressing, "the works of the flesh," which would cut off those who gave themselves up to their practice from the inheritance of the kingdom of God, he would specify this particular "work" of propounding, or embracing when propounded by  others, doctrine which should vitally deprave the truth which God had revealed? Any doctrine which thus tampered with the gospel would, of course, be a <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> - views of men's own devising and "choosing." The term, as has been seen, might also describe a body of adherents to such false doctrine. But in the passage before <span class="accented">us</span>, in which the works of the flesh are recited, and not the doers of such works, the term must describe, not persons, but acts - acts, that is, of conceiving or propounding in the Church views subversive of the gospel, and gathering adherents to such views; such adherents would, among Christians, form a <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> antagonistic to the doctrine of Christ received in the Church. "Caballings" and "divisions,' ' <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, might arise among Christians who still held fast to the substance of the gospel; fatal to the spiritual life, it might be, of those indulging in them; but yet essentially different from "heresies," because not involving departure from the faith once for all delivered to the saints, or conscious rebellion against the accredited organ d. It is of prime importance in estimating the nature of this "work of the flesh," with a practical view to our present circumstances, that we bear in mind this feature of it - that it is a relinquishment, a conscious relinquishment of the teaching of Christ, a breaking off from "the Head." The above view is precisely that given by Tertullian, ' De Prsescriptionibus Haereticorum,' 6. Bishop Lightfoot, in his Introduction to his Commentary on this Epistle, pp. 30, 31, writes thus: "<span class="accented">It</span> is not idle, as it might seem at, first sight, to follow the stream of history beyond the horizon of the apostolic age. The fragmentary notices of its subsequent career reflect some light on the temper and disposition of the Galatian Church in St. Paul's day. To Catholic writers of a later date, indeed, the failings of its infancy seemed to be so faithfully reproduced in its mature age, that they invested the apostle's rebuke with a prophetic import. Asia Minor was the nursery of heresy: and of all the Asiatic Churches it was nowhere so rife as in Galatia. The Galatian capital [Ancyra] was the stronghold of the Montanist revival, which lingered on for more than two centuries, splitting into diverse sects, each distinguished by some fantastic or minute ritual observance. Here, too, were to be found Ophites, Manicheans, sectarians of all kinds."

These belong properly to the third group, and should have been placed in the same verse with them.

This fourth group represents sins of excess. Here, too, the apostle touches a form of vice, to which abundant testimony shows the Galatians, as well as other branches of Celts, to have been especially prone. It was, perhaps, this marked feature of the Galatian nationality in particular that led St. Peter, in addressing the Churches of "Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia," to speak (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-3.htm">1 Peter 4:3</a>) of their having formerly walked in "lasciviousness, lusts, wine-bibbings, revellings, carousings (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and abominable idolatries." <span class="cmt_word">And such like</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">and those</span> (works) <span class="accented">which arc like to these. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">of the which I forewarn you</span>, <span class="accented">even as I did forewarn you.</span> The construction of the accusative <span class="greek">&#x1f05;</span> is precisely similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/john/8-54.htm">John 8:54</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>.

The apostle uses the same words in writing to the Corinthians with reference to the sins to which they were the most prone (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</a>). So <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>, "No fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God." This "kingdom" is also referred to in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>, "Walk worthily of God who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory" ("His own!" Astonishing prospect!); <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, "That ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer;" <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>, "will save me unto his heavenly kingdom." The like designation of the future felicity is given by St. Peter (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>), "entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ," and by St. James (it. 5), "heirs of the kingdom which he [God] promised to them that love him." It is derived from our Lord's own teaching, as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>, "Inherit the kingdom prepared for you;" <a href="../../par/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, "It is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." It is the manifestation and consummation of "that kingdom of heaven," or "kingdom of God," heralded by Christ and his forerunner as "at hand," which the Prophet Daniel had pointed forward to (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14, 18</a>). Bondage to "the flesh" in this life is constantly declared throughout the New Testament to form an insuperable bar to an entrance into that exalted state. And what is the alternative prospect? This the Apostle Paul does not here specify, though elsewhere he does so with awful emphasis; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/romans/2-8.htm">Romans 2:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the fruit of the Spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). As it was with a hortatory purpose, to warn, that the apostle has before enumerated the vices into which the Galatian Christians would be most in danger of falling, so now with an answering hortatory purpose, to point out the direction in which their endeavours should lie, he reckons up the dispositions and states of mind which it was the office of the Holy Spirit to produce in them. In the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-12.htm">Colossians 3:12-15</a>), written several years after, most of the features here specified reappear in the form of direct exhortation ("kindness, meekness, long-suffering, love, peace, thankfulness") - "joy" being there implicitly represented by thankfulness. The word fruit here takes the place of "works" in ver. 19, as being a more suitable designation of what are rather states of mind or habits of feeling than concrete actions like most of those previously enumerated "works." The word "fruit," moreover, describing in the vegetable world a matured product, is very commonly used in the New Testament with reference to such product as is not only of a pleasant but also of a useful kind; thus, "fruits meet for repentance;" the fruit of the True Vine in <a href="../../par/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2-16</a> which glorifies God; the abundant fruit of wheat (<a href="../../par/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>); the fruit of righteousness (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>); the fruit gathered by an evangelist (<a href="../../par/john/4-36.htm">John 4:36</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>); so that it was no doubt introduced here, as also in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>, with the intended suggestion, that the graces here specified are results answering to the design of the great Giver of the Spirit's influences, and are in their own nature wholesome and grateful. The singular number of the noun is employed in preference to the plural, which is found <span class="accented">e.g.</span>  <a href="../../par/philippians/1-11.htm">Philippians 1:11</a> and <a href="../../par/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, in consequence probably of the feeling which the apostle had that the combination of graces described is <span class="accented">in its entirety</span> the proper outcome in each individual of the Spirit's agency; the character which he will fain evolve in every soul subject to his dominion, comprises all these features; so that the absence of any one mars in a degree the perfection of the product. The relation expressed by the genitive case of the noun, "of the Spirit," is probably much the same as is expressed by the corresponding genitive, "of the flesh;" in each case meaning "belonging to," or "due to the operation of;" for the agent who in the one case does the works is not the flesh, but the person acting under the influence of the flesh; so here, the fruit-bearer is not "the Spirit," but the person controlled by the Spirit. Comp. <a href="../../par/romans/7-4.htm">Romans 7:4</a>, "that we might bring forth fruit unto God;" <a href="../../par/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>, "that ye bear much fruit." These fruits do not appear upon us without strenuous endeavour on our own part. Accordingly the apostle exhorts the Philippians (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12, 13</a>) to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling, because they have so august a co-Agent working with and in them. Indeed, it is for the very purpose of prompting and directing such endeavour that this list of gracious fruits is here given (comp. ver. 25). The enumeration does not expressly mention such dispositions of mind as have God for their object. These, however, may be discerned as lying couched under the three first named, "love, joy, peace," and possibly under "faith;" certainly joy and peace are the proper products of our hearty acceptance of the gospel, and of that alone; they presuppose the establishment of a conscious state of reconciliation with God. But just here the apostle seems more especially concerned to show how blessed, under the Spirit's guidance, the Christian's state will be, and in what manner Christians as thus led will act towards one another (cf. vers. 15 and 26). The Christian life is habitually regarded by the apostle much more as a corporate, fellow-Christian, life, than, owing to various causes, some of which we may hope are now in course of removal, we modern Christians, and especially English Church, men, are in the habit of regarding it. Is love (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span>). We cannot separate this branch of Christian character from those which follow, as in essence distinct from them; it is organically connected with them, and in fact, as stated above (ver. 14), involves them all, being "the bond of perfectness" (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a>). in the "dithyramb of love," chanted in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>, the apostle triumphantly proclaims this truth; as also on the other had in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a> he affirms that true Christian love has its root in "a pure heart, a good conscience, and genuine faith." The soul cannot be free for the activity of genuine love, towards fellow-believers and towards fellow-creatures in general, as long as it is restrained in its emotions toward the supreme common Father of all; the inward vice of mind, whatever it may be, which darkens the spirit towards heaven must inevitably cramp and benumb benevolent action universally (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/5-2.htm">1 John 5:2</a>). In truth, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;</span> means a loving temper of mind which, like the love which God bears towards us, is in a degree irrespective of merit, welling forth <span class="accented">towards all being</span>, so far as circumstances permit; though with greatest intensity towards God and those in whom it can recognize the image of God. Hence St, John is able to reason as he does in <a href="../../par/1_john/4-20.htm">1 John 4:20</a>, "He that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen." Joy (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>). It is impossible to accept Calvin's notion, that this means a cheerful carriage towards fellow-Christians, though it includes it; it must mean the glad-heartedness produced by entire faith in God's love to us (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-13.htm">Romans 15:13</a>). The exhortation which is here implied, that such sentiments should be carefully cherished, is elsewhere given explicitly and with reiteration; as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>. There is thus much ground for Calvin's view, that the inward feeling of satisfaction and joy, which is the proper fruit of a true Christian's faith in the gospel, cannot fail to manifest itself in his behavior towards his fellow-men by a sacred species of light-heartedness and hilarity which it is impossible for us to manifest or to feel, as long as we have within a consciousness of estrangement from God, or a suspicion that things are not well with us in relation to him. It is probable that the apostle, in writing down this word, did it with a consciousness of the contrast which is presented by the coldness and severity of feeling towards others which are begotten by the bondage of legality (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Peace</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>), This is conjoined with "joy" in the two passages of the Romans just before cited (<a href="../../par/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>): "The kingdom of God [i.e. its great blessedness] is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>), "The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit;" in both which passages the "peace" referred to is the serenity of soul arising from the consciousness of being brought home to the favour of God and to obedience to his will. On the other hand, the term as here introduced seems likewise intended to stand  in contrast with those sins of strife and malignity noted before among the works of the flesh, and therefore to point to peacefulness in the Christian community. The two are vitally connected: the Spirit produces peaceful harmony among Christians by producing in their minds, individually, a peaceful sense of harmony with God and a compliancy in all things with his providential appointments. This resigned trustfulness towards God quells at their very fountain-head those disturbances of passion and that inward fretting and impatience in reference to outward things, including the behaviour of others, which are the main causes of strife. The interdependence between inward and outward peace is indicated in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14, 15</a>. If "the peace of God rules, is arbitrator (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), in our hearts" individually, if it "holds guard over our hearts and our thoughts" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>), it cannot fail to produce and maintain harmony amongst us towards one another. <span class="cmt_word">Long-suffering, gentleness</span>, <span class="cmt_word">goodness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">long-sufferng</span>, <span class="accented">kindness</span>, <span class="accented">goodness.</span> These are actings of the all-comprising grace of "<span class="accented">love."</span> For the two first, comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>, "Love suffereth long, is kind (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>);" while the third, "goodness," sums up the other actings of love enumerated in vers. 5 and 6 or the same chapter. It is difficult to distinguish between <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, except so far as that the former, which etymologically means "usableness," seems to signify more distinctly "sweetness of disposition," "amiability," "a compliant willingness to be serviceable to others." It is, however, repeatedly used by St. Paul of God's benignity (<a href="../../par/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-22.htm">Romans 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-7.htm">Ephesians 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4</a>), as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> also is by many thought to be in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>, which last point, however, is very questionable. This latter term, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, occurs besides in <a href="../../par/romans/15-14.htm">Romans 15:14</a> and <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-9.htm">Ephesians 5:9</a>, as a very wide description of human goodness, apparently in the sense of active benevolence. Faith (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">faith</span> or <span class="accented">faithfulness.</span> It is disputed in what precise shade of meaning the apostle here uses this term. The sense of "fidelity," which beyond question it bears in <a href="../../par/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>, seems out of place, when we consider the particular evils which are now in his eye as existing or in danger of arising in the Galatian Churches. Belief in the gospel suits this requirement perfectly, and presents us with the apparently needed contrast to the "heresies" of ver. 20. If this sense seems not to be favoured by the immediate neighbourhood on one side of "kindness" and "goodness," it is, however, quite coherent with the "meekness" on the other, if we understand by this latter term a tractable spirit, compliant to the teaching of the Divine Word; comp. <a href="../../par/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>, "receive with meekness the implanted word," and <a href="../../par/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a>, "The meek [Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>] will he guide in judgment, the meek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) will he teach his way." In <a href="../../par/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>, "judgment, mercy, and faith," the term seems (comp. <a href="../../par/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>) to refer to faith towards God. In <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>, "righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness," there is no reason for interpreting it otherwise than as faith in God and his gospel; and if so, its collocation there with "love, patience, meekness," countenances us in taking it so here, where it stands in a very similar collocation. Comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-23.htm">Ephesians 6:23</a>, "Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

(On this, see last note.) The humble <span class="accented">submissiveness</span> to the teachings of Divine revelation, to which this term probably points, stands in contrast with that self-reliant, headstrong impetuosity which in the temperament of the Celt is apt to hurry him into the adoption of novel ideas which he has not taken the trouble seriously to weigh.

"Against;" as in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-21.htm">Galatians 3:21</a>. The Law finds nothing to condemn in these things, and therefore no ground for condemning those who live in the practice of them; the same idea as is more explicitly brought out in <a href="../../par/romans/8-1.htm">Romans 8:1-4</a>. There is a tone of meiosis, of suppressed triumph in this sentence. "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's chosen ones?"

The presence of the article seems to betoken that the word "Christ" is introduced as an official description rather than as a proper name, "the Christ Jesus" being thus a phrase similar to "the Lord Jesus." Not being so familiar to us as this latter, it appears at first more uncouth than it really is. To understand the precise force of the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>, we must review the foregoing context. In vers. 16, 17 the apostle puts in contrast with each other, "walking by the Spirit" and "fulfilling the desire of the flesh." In the three following verses (19-21) he points out what kind of life the flesh prompts men to pursue, and its fatal consequences; in vers. 22, 23 the character formed by the Spirit's influence, and its blessed immunity from the censure of the Law. He is now concerned to show how these considerations apply to Christians. A Christian (he says) by becoming such puts away the flesh; is alive, therefore, if at all, by or to the Spirit; this being so, he must in all reason by the Spirit's direction rule his conduct. It results from this review that the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> turns the course of remark upon a new topic, namely, the essential character of a Christian's profession as a premiss to introduce the practical conclusion stated in ver. 25. The use of the possessive, "of the Christ Jesus," is similar to that in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-23.htm">1 Corinthians 3:23</a>, "ye are Christ's;" <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>, "he is not his;" Romans14:8, "we are the Lord's."

We are made Christ's people, outwardly and in covenant, by baptism; but we cannot be his very own, really and vitally (<a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>), unless through faith we recognize him as our Lord and of our own free will and deed attach ourselves heartily to his discipleship. In that hour of renunciation of sin we in truth "fasten the flesh to the cross." <span class="cmt_word">Have</span> <span class="cmt_word">crucified the flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). That is, have put it away from them, as a thing to be abhorred, that it might die the death. These three several particulars of thought appear combined in the <span class="accented">mixt mode</span> embodied in the word "crucified." The verb, denoting simply <span class="accented">affixing</span> to the cross, and not <span class="accented">putting to death</span> by crucifixion, intimates the lingering character of the death which the flesh was to undergo. It was, indeed, put away at once, by a final decisive act of the will; but it would still for a while continue to live. Viewed thus, the notion represented by the image harmonizes with the statement in ver. 17 of the continued conflict which is being waged within us between the flesh and the Spirit. The time when the Christian did thus affix the flesh to the cross is indicated by the form of expression, of being "of Christ;" there can have been no time since he has been Christ's at which this thing had not been already done. It is, alas, but too possible to take the flesh still living down from the cross and clasp it afresh to our bosom; but cherishing that as our friend, we are Christ's no longer. Above (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>) the apostle wrote, "I am hanging on the cross with Christ: but I live;" but with a different application of the image. There he was thinking of the relation into which his union with the crucified Jesus brought him with respect to the Mosaical Law. Here he has in view the renunciation of sin which accompanies the addiction of ourselves to Christ's service. There he himself is crucified; here, the flesh. The cross once more recurs in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, with yet another reference. The description here given by the apostle of Christian conversion tallies well with that given by him in <a href="../../par/romans/6-3.htm">Romans 6:3-11</a>. There, however, the change through which a man becomes a Christian is couched under a different image - that of a death and resurrection, analogous to and founded upon the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, which, in baptism, administered according to the original primitive mode, are represented by the immersion in and the emerging from the water. While illustrating this image, the apostle further says (ver. 6), "Our old man was crucified with him (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>), that the body of sin might be done away, that we should no longer be in bondage to sin;" where the Greek word rendered "was crucified with (him)" again denotes being affixed to the cross, in sympathy with him "who was made sin for us," with the view of bringing to nought "the body of sin "- which phrase, "body of sin," is nearly equivalent to "flesh," being the sum total of the vicious activities in which the flesh manifests itself; this bringing to nought or doing away (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of the body of sin, being the result ultimately to follow from the crucifixion, and not identical with it. In the passage in the Romans now referred to, the apostle brings to view, not only the just now cited description of the negative side of our regeneration, but also its positive side, of a passing into a new sphere of activities "walking in newness of life," and "living unto God in Christ Jesus." In our present passage the negative phrase is alone definitely stated. The difference is probably due to the fact that the figure of crucifying the flesh supplies the illustration of only the negative aspect; whereas baptism, with its watery burial and resurrection, represents the positive aspect as well. <span class="cmt_word">With the affections and</span>  <span class="cmt_word">lusts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">with its affections and its lusts.</span> The difference between "affections" and "lusts" may be probably assumed to be this - that the former denotes disordered states of the soul viewed as in a condition of disease, well represented in the Authorized Version by "affections;" whine the latter points to the <span class="accented">goings forth</span> of the soul towards objects which it is wrong to pursue. In <a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-11.htm">1 Peter 1:11</a>, and a number of other passages the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> means "sufferings." Only once besides is it used in an ethical sense; in <a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a> we read, "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of sins which were through the Law wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death;" and in vers. 7, 8 the apostle instances "coveting" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) as wrought by sin in his soul, by occasion of the commandment, "Thou shalt not covet." We seem led to conjecture that he meant that a sinful condition of the soul (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) was by the commandment stimulated into a mere aggressive action. We have <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a> and <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:5</a>, and the plural <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> in <a href="../../par/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>; in each case of exorbitant sexual desire. But in the apostle's use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> in its ethical sense we seem to have neither the notion of extreme intensity nor the limitation to one particular class of desire, which are both of them apparent in his use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. This clause, "with its affections and its lusts," adds nothing to the substantial sense of "the flesh." The apostle seems led to subjoin the words by a pathetic remembrance o the moral miseries appertaining to "the flesh" - "those affections and those desires thereof which are so hard to control, and which are at the same time so fatal to our welfare." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-25.htm">Galatians 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If we live in the Spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">if we live by</span>, or <span class="accented">to</span>, <span class="accented">the Spirit.</span> Exact critics have commonly recognized the difficulty of precisely determining either the sense in which the dative case of <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, is used, or the meaning of the verb "live." This verb is here distinguished from the verb of the next clause (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) in much the same way as it is distinguished from the verb "walk" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a>, "In the which ye also walked aforetime when ye lived in these things." In both passages it denotes the moral sphere of existence in which it is our ruling choice to live. In <a href="../../par/colossians/3-7.htm">Colossians 3:7</a> the apostle says that their chosen sphere of existence was once worldliness and vice; and, when it was so, then they had followed in detail those different forms of degrading sin which he has specified in ver. 5. The verb "live" is used in the same sense of the general setting of our moral habits viewed as a whole in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>. "If ye died with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, Handle not, etc.?" So, likewise <a href="../../par/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2</a>, "We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein?" also <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, "If ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye make to die the deeds of the body, ye shall live;" in which last passage the changed sense of the verb in the second sentence is noticeable. In the passage before us, the "we" of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> are of course the same persons as are recited by the phrase, "they who are of the Christ," in ver. 21. These persons have fastened the flesh to the cross; by a final, professedly irrevocable resolve, they have renounced sin. The purpose that was the proper, necessary concomitant of this, was to make the domain of the Spirit thenceforward their sphere of existence; their life was now to be in the Spirit; as the apostle writes (<a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a>)," Ye are not in (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) the flesh, but in (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you;" for in this last passage the phrase, "in the Spirit," is contrasted with "in the flesh," each denoting the sphere of moral habits; in which sense "the flesh" is often used, as well as at other times of the vitiated nature itself, the indulgence in which characterizes that sphere. So probably "according, to the Spirit of holiness, in contrast to according to the flesh," in <a href="../../par/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3, 4</a>. Now, as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> the apostle uses the word "Spirit" in two senses, first of the sphere of moral habits determined by the Spirit's influence, and then of the Holy Spirit itself, so he would appear to do here. In respect to the relation expressed by the dative case, although the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/romans/8-9.htm">Romans 8:9</a> is here wanting, it admits of being taken of the sphere of being in which Christians as such live; for so we find the dative used in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>, "put to death (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>) in the flesh, but quickened (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;</span>) in the Spirit," as also the dative <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;</span> is constructed in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-1.htm">Galatians 4:1</a> of the same Epistle. The relation expressed by the case, however, may be that which it denotes in <a href="../../par/romans/6-2.htm">Romans 6:2, 10</a>, "die (<span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>) unto sin;" ibid., 11, "dead unto sin, alive unto God;" <a href="../../par/romans/14-6.htm">Romans 14:6</a>, "live unto the Lord, die unto the Lord;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-15.htm">2 Corinthians 5:15</a>, "live unto him that died for them:" thus Bishop Lightfoot takes it. The "if" is logical rather than conditional; they who are Christ's have no life but in the Spirit, and are thus bound in the details of their conduct to act accordingly. <span class="cmt_word">Let us also walk in the Spirit</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">by</span> (or, <span class="accented">unto</span>) <span class="accented">the Spirit let us also walk.</span> The dative is here most naturally understood of the rule according to which we should walk. If the relation intended by the dative in the preceding clause is expressed by "to," it  might be most convenient to render it similarly here; but even so, it must mean with reference to the Spirit as our rule and guide. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, "to move iv a (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> ) line or row with others" (see Liddell and Scott), is no doubt chosen in place of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, the more usual word for "walk," as denoting an orderly, well-regulated way of behaviour. This tinge of meaning is discernible in the other instances of its use in the New Testament, as <a href="../../par/galatians/6-16.htm">Galatians 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-16.htm">Philippians 3:16</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/5-26.htm">Galatians 5:26</a></div><div class="verse">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let us not be desirous of vain glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">let us not be vain-glorious.</span> The <span class="accented">communicative</span> form of exhortation in which the speaker conjoins himself with those whom he addresses in order to soften the tone of superiority implied in exhorting them, connects this verse closely with the preceding one, in which also it is employed. Indeed, as in outward term of expression this verse coheres with ver. 25, so also in substance it coheres strictly with the whole passage beginning with ver. 13; for this is throughout levelled against a spirit of contentiousness then rife in the Galatian Churches. One cause to which the apostle thinks this ill state of things to be especially due was the spirit of vainglory or self-vaunting - a weakness to which the Celtic race has ever been markedly prone (see Lightfoot's 'Introduction,' p. 14). The softened form of exhortation visible in the use of the first person plural has been traced also by many critics in the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;</span> as if the writer meant to imply that they were not as yet really vainglorious, but were in danger of <span class="accented">becoming</span> so. This, however, is not so clear. This verb is often used when there is no reference at all intended to passing out of a former state into a new one, but simply as meaning" show one's self," "be in act, so and so." Thus <a href="../../par/romans/16-2.htm">Romans 16:2</a>, "she hath been (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) a succourer of many;" <a href="../../par/philippians/3-6.htm">Philippians 3:6</a>, "found (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) blameless;" <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>, "what manner of men we showed ourselves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>);" ibid., 1 Thessalonians 2:7; <a href="../../par/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>. Very often is this verb so used in exhortations, and especially in the present tense; as <a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>, "Be not (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) wise in your own conceits;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-16.htm">1 Corinthians 4:16</a>, "Be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) imitators of me;" (so ibid., 1 Corinthians 11:1; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>); <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-32.htm">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>, "Be giving no occasion for stumbling (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>);" 14:20, "Be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) not babes in understanding, but in understanding be (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) full-grown men;" and so often. In many of such cases there can be no reference to preceding conduct, whether in the way of approval or disapproval, but simply an exhortation to be or not to be so and so. The Authorized Version, therefore, is quite right in here rendering, "Let us not be," etc. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs only here in the New Testament, as the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is only found in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. The <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> from which it is derived may be either "notion," "opinion," or "glory." Accordingly in Wisd. 14:14, and Ignatius, 'Ad Magnes,' 11, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> appears to mean the following of vain, idle notions with which we may compare the words <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. But here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is considered by most critics to mean "affecting, desirous of, empty glory;" so the Authorized Version, "desirous of vain glory," where "vain glory" are two words, not one. Such empty glory would mean glory founded on distinctive qualities, which either are merely imaginary, not existing at all, or which, if there, give no real title to honour. Perhaps, however, the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> of this compound is always "notion," "opinion," only varying so far in meaning as sometimes to denote opinions respecting ourselves; as Suidas says, "<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, a vain thinking respecting one's self;" at other times, notions about ether matters. The best interpretation of the word as here used is suggested by the apostle's own words in the next chapter (ver. 3), "if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself." As again in <a href="../../par/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>," Doing nothing through faction or through vain glory;" the sense of the second noun is illustrated by the converse, "But in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself," suggesting its meaning to be the disposition to claim a superiority over others which we are not entitled to. "Wise in our own conceits" (<a href="../../par/romans/12-16.htm">Romans 12:16</a>) is one form of this vicious quality; but there are others, all, however, fundamentally and intensely inimical to a spirit of loving sympathy with other men. <span class="cmt_word">Provoking one another, envying one another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">challenging one another</span>, <span class="accented">envying one another.</span> Here again are two Greek words found nowhere else in the New Testament <span class="accented">-</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;</span>. The rendering of the first in the Authorized Version, "provoking," is perhaps not meant in the sense in which this English verb is now commonly used, and in which it <span class="accented">also</span> frequently occurs in our English Bible, of "making angry," but in the proper sense of the Latin verb <span class="accented">prorocantes</span>, "challenging,' ' <span class="accented">e.g</span>., to legal controversy, or to battle, or to mutual comparative estimation in any way. Any superiority, real or imaginary, in gifts spiritual (as <span class="accented">eharisms</span>) or natural, in eloquence, in theological acquirements, in qualification for office, in public estimation, even in moral consistency (for what follows in <a href="../../par/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> seems to point in this last direction), might be among the Galatians either an occasion for self-vaunting or a subject of envy on the part of those who felt themselves  cast in the shade. What it was in actual facts which gave the apostle Occasion for administering this implied reproof, it is impossible to conjecture Therein an evident correlation between the "challenging: on the part of those who felt themselves strong, and the "envying" on the part of those who found themselves weak; both faults being, however, traceable to one and the same root - the excessive wish to be thought much of. <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../galatians/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Galatians 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Galatians 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../galatians/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Galatians 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Galatians 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

<a href="../../par/galatians/4-31.htm">Galatians 4:31</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-11.htm">Galatians 5:11</a>. But <a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 17</a> suffice to show that its occurrence at the beginning of a sentence does not necessarily indicate the commencement of a new section of discourse - to which notion we, perhaps. owe the division of chapters here made. In fact, this paragraph is most closely connected with the preceding; the apostle's object being to point out that not even a moral delinquency into which a brother has fallen should lead us to indulge ourselves in any feeling of superiority in dealing with him, or to vaunt even to our own selves (see ver. 4) our greater consistency. In short, he is enforcing by a strong instance the exhortation in ver. 26, "Let us not be vain-glorious." "If even a man hath been overtaken." The apostle supposes the case as one which might very well present itself; the form of expression (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>), however, not pointing to such a case having already occurred. How possible the supposed case was, was plain enough from the enumeration of the "works of the flesh" above given, so many and so multiform. Some critics have embarrassed themselves by supposing that the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> ("even") must, Of course, emphasize the first succeeding word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>, "hath been overtaken." But it may just as probably be meant to emphasize the whole clause, "a man hath been overtaken in some trespass." This is proved by a number of other instances: thus: <a href="../../par/luke/11-8.htm">Luke 11:8</a>, "if (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) even he will not give them unto him because he is a friend;" <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-21.htm">1 Corinthians 7:21</a>. "but if even thou art able to become free;" <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-6.htm">2 Corinthians 11:6</a>. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> occurs besides in the New Testament in <a href="../../par/mark/14-8.htm">Mark 14:8</a>, "she hath come beforehand to anoint ['or, 'she hath anticipated the anointing of "my body;" and <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-21.htm">1 Corinthians 11:21</a>, "taketh before other his own supper." A more helpful illustration, however, is furnished by Wisd. 17:17, where, speaking of the horrible darkness falling quite suddenly upon the Egyptians, the writer says, "Whether he were husbandman or shepherd or labourer in the field, he was overtaken and endured (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) the ill-avoidable necessity;" the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;</span> in the compound verb meaning before he could help himself in any way. So here, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc0;&#x1fbe;</span> means be surprised, overtaken, before he' is well aware what it really is that he is doing. "Surprised;" but by whom or what? Not by a person detecting the offender in the very act; as if it were equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4</a>); for the apostle is not at all concerned with the <span class="accented">evidence</span> for the delinquency, which is the important consideration in <a href="../../par/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4</a>, but simply with the <span class="accented">fact.</span> Rather, overtaken by the force of temptation; as the verb "<span class="accented">taken"</span> is used with "temptation" in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; hence the words which follow," lest thou also be tempted." The writer thus commends the delinquent to sympathetic commiseration. But there is no palliation indicated by the word "fault" or "trespass." Not once in the fifteen other passages in the New Testament in which the noun <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> occurs is there any token of such palliation being intended. The petition, "forgive us our trespasses," is sufficient to exemplify  this statement. The trespass may be nothing less than one of the works of the flesh before specified. The preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> - "in," not "by" - points to the unhappy condition in which the delinquent is supposed to be, out of which it is the business of Christian charity to extricate him. Compare the expressions, "die in your sins;" "dead in trespasses;" and the imagery of a "snare of the devil," in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ye which are spiritual, restore such a one</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). The apostle intimates that the business of recovering a fallen brother is one which those Christians are not qualified to undertake who, by reason of the strong tincture of the flesh still existing in their moral character, may themselves be justly styled "carnal" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>. D. Putting as it were such persons on one side, the apostle summons to the work those in whom the Spirit hath gained so marked an ascendancy that, compared with the generality of Christians, they may be classed as "spiritual." It was incumbent on such (he says) not to stand aloof, as if it were not their concern, or as ff the delinquent were to be treated as an enemy or outcast (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:15</a>), far less to indulge themselves in taking pleasure in his inconsistency as illustrating their own spirituality, but to come forward to his assistance. Others, who might justly feel less qualified to act in the case themselves, might, however, take from the apostle's direction the hint that at least they should lend their sympathy to the work of their more capable brethren, desire and pray for their erring brother's recovery, and not exult over his fault. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "to make a thing fit, even, just that which it properly should be," is used in <a href="../../par/matthew/4-21.htm">Matthew 4:21</a> of repairing nets; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> of a Christian community restored to its proper condition of unanimity; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:10</a> of making good any lacking of faith. It is used also (Liddel; and Scott) of setting a broken limb. But there is nothing to show that the apostle has any one particular image of disorder in view. The present tense of the imperative seems to mean, "apply yourselves to restore him;" the actual achievement (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) may not be in their power, <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit of</span> <span class="cmt_word">meekness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">in a spirit of meekness.</span> We have the same phrase in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-21.htm">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, "Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?' The term "spirit" seems as it were to hover between the sense of the Holy Spirit and of that particular condition of our own spirit which is produced by his influence (compare "spirit of adoption," <a href="../../par/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>). But the latter seems here the one more immediately intended. It is not identical, however, with the phrase, "meek spirit," which we have in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>. The meekness or tenderness meant is that of one who, humbly conscious of human infirmity in general, his own infirmity included, is prepared to be very considerate and gentle towards the ignorant and those out of the way; loth to use the "rod." <span class="cmt_word">Considering</span> <span class="cmt_word">thyself, lest thou also be tempted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">looking to thine own self</span>, <span class="accented">lest thou also be tempted.</span> The change from the plural to the singular makes the warning more impressive and searching. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament always denotes looking intently: sometimes on something to be guarded against, as <a href="../../par/luke/11-35.htm">Luke 11:35</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/16-17.htm">Romans 16:17</a>; at other times, at something to be aimed at or imitated (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-18.htm">2 Corinthians 4:18</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>). The former is meant here. The Christian is to be on his guard against his own weak and corrupt nature; lest he withhold help, or adequate help; lest in helping he get betrayed into the sin of Pharisaic self-righteousness - the sin of harshness, censoriousness. The clause is to be viewed in conjunction with the thought of the unceasing conflict between the flesh and the Spirit mentioned in ch. 5:17. "Tempted," so as to fall (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-5.htm">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Bear ye one another's burdens</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>); <span class="accented">carry ye</span>, or, <span class="accented">be ready to carry</span>, <span class="accented">the heavy loads of one another.</span> The position of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> gives it especial prominence; as it stands here it seems pregnant with the exhortation, look not every man only at his own griefs, but at the griefs also of others" (cf. <a href="../../par/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, weight, points to an excessive weight, such as it is a toil to carry. <a href="../../par/matthew/20-12.htm">Matthew 20:12</a>, "who have borne the burden (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and heat of the day." So in <a href="../../par/acts/15-28.htm">Acts 15:28</a>. In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, "weight of glory," the phrase, suggested by the double sense of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">kabhod</span>, indicates the enormous greatness of the future glory. The supposition that the apostle was glancing at the burden of Mosaical observances, superseded as a matter for care on our part by the burdens of our brethren, seems far-fetched. These "heavy loads" are those which a man brings upon himself by acts of transgression: such as an uneasy conscience; difficulties in his domestic, social, or Church relations; pecuniary embarrassments; or other. But the precept seems to go beyond the requirements of the particular case of a peccant brother which has suggested it, and to take in all the needs, spiritual or secular, which we are subject to. (For <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> of carrying a toilsome burden, comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-17.htm">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-17.htm">John 19:17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>.)  <span class="cmt_word">And so fulfil the law of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> [or, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">and so fulfil</span> (or, <span class="accented">ye shall fulfil</span>) <span class="accented">the law of Christ.</span> The sense comes to much the same, whether in the Greek we read the future indicative or the aorist imperative. If the imperative be retained, it yet adds no new element of precept to the foregoing; the clause so read <span class="accented">prescribes</span> the fulfilment of Christ's law in the particular form of bearing one another's burdens. If we read the future, the clause <span class="accented">affirms</span> that in so doing we shall fulfil his law; which in the other case is implied. Many have supposed the word "law" to be here used for a specific commandment; as for example Christ's new commandment that we should love one another, So St. James (it. 8) writes of the "royal law." St. Paul, however, never uses the term in this sense in his own writing, though in the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16), the plural "laws" occurs in citation from Jeremiah. It seems better to take it of the whole moral institution of Christ, whether conveyed in distinct precept or in his example and spirit of action. Compare with the present passage the advice which St. Paul gives the "strong" (<a href="../../par/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1-4</a>), that they should bear (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as here, "carry") the infirmities of the weak, and not wish to please themselves; after Christ's pattern set forth in prophetical Scripture, of old time written in order to instruct us how we should act. It has been often observed that the phrase, "the law of Christ," was selected with allusion to the stir now being made among the Galatians respecting the Law of Moses. "Satisfy ye the requirements of the Law - not of Moses which some are prating about, but the law of Christ, a more perfect law than that other, and more our proper con-corn."

The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, is well illustrated by the passage cited by critics from Plato's 'Apologia,' p. 41, E: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>,...  <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> "Something" is, by a common meiosis, put for "something considerable" (cf. <a href="../../par/galatians/2-6.htm">Galatians 2:6</a>). The especial form of eminence, the claim to which is here referred to, is eminence in spirituality and consistency as a servant of Christ. Possibly the apostle has in his eye certain individuals among the Galatians that he had heard of, who, professing much, were, however, self-complacently bitter and contemptuous towards brethren who had gone wrong in moral conduct or who differed from themselves in the disputes then rife in those Churches. The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3bd;</span>, "being nothing," is a part of the hypothesis relative to the individual case spoken of, not a statement putting forth the aphorism that no one is really anything. The passage quoted above from Plato shows, that in the latter case we should have had <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> and not <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>. Some men, by the grace of God, <span class="accented">are</span> "something;" but these persons only fancy themselves to be so. Whether any man is really "something" or not is determined by his practical conduct - his "work" as the apostle expresses it in the next verse. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in the New Testament only here, though we have the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, deceivers, in <a href="../../par/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>. St. James (<a href="../../par/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>) speaks of a man "deceiving his heart ' in seemingly just the same sense. In both passages it appears to be meant that a man palms off upon his own mind fancies as if they were just apprehensions of real facts; in both also these fancies are but illusive notions of one's own religious character - here, as being "spiritual;" in James, as being "religious" or "devout" (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">- the</span> activity of practical benevolence being in both cases wanting; for "<span class="accented">the</span> bridling not his tongue" in ver. 26 is proved by the contrasted behaviour spoken of in the next verse to refer to those <span class="accented">sins</span> of the tongue which are implicitly condemned in vers. 19-21.

In other words, "Let each man be endeavouring in a spirit of self-watch-fulness to walk orderly according to the Spirit."

It depends upon the whole phrase, "shall have his ground of glorying," and not upon the word rendered "ground of glorying" alone.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, with its derivatives - a favourite term with St. Paul  - often appears to mean "rejoicing" rather than" boasting" (cf. <a href="../../par/romans/5-2.htm">Romans 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>); but it seems desirable as a rule to render it by "glorying," with the understanding that the writer has frequently the joyous state of feeling more prominently in his view than the utterance of self-gratulation. What the apostle meant by "having one's ground of glorying in regard to one's own self alone," is well illustrated by what he says respecting himself in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>,  "Our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom, but in the grace of God, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward." he had been himself in the habit of testing his conduct and spirit by the standard of Christ's law; and this was the fruit. <span class="cmt_word">And not in another</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">and not in regard to that neighbour of his.</span> The article probably points to that neighbour with whom he has been comparing himself; and so, perhaps, also in <a href="../../par/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a></div><div class="verse">For every man shall bear his own burden.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For every man shall bear his</span> <span class="cmt_word">own burden</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for each man shall carry his own pack.</span> A man's business is with his own pack; and all depends upon his carrying <span class="accented">that</span>, not putting it down. This "pack" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is the whole of the duties for the discharge of which each man is responsible. It is thus that the image is employed by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-30.htm">Matthew 11:30</a>), "My yoke is easy, and my pack is light." So also in <a href="../../par/matthew/23-4.htm">Matthew 23:4</a>, "For they tie up packs heavy and hard to carry, and lay them upon men's shoulders." The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "the pack which is individually his own," implies that men's responsibilities vary, each one having such as are peculiar to himself. This "pack" is to be carefully distinguished from the  "heavy loads" (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>) of ver. 2, Our Christian obligations Christ makes, to them who serve him well, <span class="accented">light</span>; but our burdens of remorse, shame, grief, loss, which are of our own wilful procuring, these may be, must needs be, <span class="accented">heavy.</span> One part of our "pack" of obligation is to help each other in bearing these "heavy loads;" and we shall find our joy and crown of glorying in doing so; not only in the approval of our own consciences and in the consciousness of Christ's approval, but also in the manifold refreshments of mutual Christian sympathy. On the other hand, our Christian responsibilities, including these of mutual sympathy and succour, we must not attempt to evade. One man is able to do more for others than another man can; the truly "spiritual" man, for example, can do that which others may not even attempt to touch: each one has his own part and duty. And Christ's <span class="accented">mot d'ordre</span> to all his workmen, or possibly the apostle means to all his soldiers, is this: "Every man carry his own pack!" The future tense of the verb "shall carry" does not point to some future time, but to the absoluteness of the law for all time; as in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a> (see Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 40, p. 251, 6th edit.). The varying turn given to the same general image of carrying burdens in ver. 2 and here is quite in St. Paul's manner. Compare, for example, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>. the varying turn given to the images of "epistle" and "veil."

It is, in fact, here merely a conjunction of transition: not in any degree adversative; for the exhortation to liberality towards our teachers is perfectly germane to the preceding topics of carrying  one another's loads, and so carrying our own pack. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, etymologically "to fill with sound," thence signifies "to din a thing into another person's mind with inculcation or constant repetition," in which sense it occurs in <a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21, 24</a>, of the persistent repetition of a slanderous report. So early as in Hippocrates (Liddell and Scott) the verbal substantive <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is used for "instruction;" and the verb, though not occurring in Attic writers, seems to have continued in use in other dialects, to reappear at length in the Common Dialect of Greek. Accordingly, it is found in the sense of "instruct" in <a href="../../par/luke/1-4.htm">Luke 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/2-18.htm">Romans 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-19.htm">1 Corinthians 14:19</a>. It does not denote instruction by question and answer in particular, but simply the inculcating of knowledge. Recently as the Galatian Churches had been founded, it appears from this passage that there were already persons among them whose particular business it was to give religious instruction to their fellow-Christians; so much their business, that they were on this ground entitled to receive from those they taught liberal help in temporal things. Such persons were doubtless included among the "elders" whom Paul and Barnabas appointed in the several Churches which they planted (<a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). It is noticeable, further, that the order of men alone singled out as entitled to such secular assistance is characterized as a teaching order; so characterized, per-hops, because teaching religious truth was the most prominent and characteristic of their functions. In his First Epistle to Timothy (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>), written, probably, some years later, "the elders who labour in Word and teaching (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)" are particularized as those among the "presiding elders" who are the "most especially" entitled to liberal payment; the form of expression, however, implying that elders whose function lay in other duties than that of teaching were likewise entitled to liberal consideration. The teaching elders would require, more than other Church officers, leisure from worldly avocations for the study of God's Word and his truth, and for the actual discharge of their especial work in private as well as in public (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/6-4.htm">Acts 6:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>). The direction here given would apply, as to the case of resident teachers, so also to that of persons who travelled about in the dissemination of the faith; as we learn from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4-14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-7.htm">2 Corinthians 11:7-12</a>. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12, 13</a> the apostle commends to the "high estimation" of the disciples "those who laboured among them, and were ever them in the Lord, and admonished them (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>);   The expression "the Word" is used without any further qualification to designate the Christian doctrine, as in <a href="../../par/mark/2-2.htm">Mark 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/4-14.htm">Mark 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-14.htm">Philippians 1:14</a>. So the Christian religion is styled "the Way" in <a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>. "Share;' the verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and its derivatives are frequently used with reference to that kind of "fellowship" or "partnership" which is evinced by our liberally sharing with the object of it in our worldly means. If we "count a minister our partner (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)," as St. Paul writes to Philemon (ver. 17), we shall not begrudge him frank and generous help in any direction. Thus <a href="../../par/romans/12-13.htm">Romans 12:13</a>, "Communicating to the necessities of saints," is properly "sharing with them in generous sympathy." So <a href="../../par/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14</a>, "had fellowship with (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) my affliction" points to liberal temporal assistance. Similarly, generous sympathy embodied in money gifts is styled "communion," or "partnership," in <a href="../../par/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>; as also <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "ready to communicate," expresses one ready to show such sympathy, in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>. The apostle regards, and would have others regard, such offices of kindness with a fine delicate feeling, not as giving as if from a higher level of condition, but as sharing with brothers, with whom all things are held in common. Chrysostom and others consider the word to point to an interchange or barter of goods, spiritual and temporal, referring to <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>. "In all good things;" in all good things of this life which he himself possesses. "Good things" as in <a href="../../par/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18, 19</a> ("my goods"); Luke 16:25; the preposition "in," as in <a href="../../par/matthew/23-30.htm">Matthew 23:30</a>, "partakers in the blood of the prophets." The exact import of this clause, which has been variously interpreted, is best appreciated by our taking account of the warmth of indignant feeling with which the apostle is writing. This clearly transpires both from the words, "be not deceived," and from the assurance, "God is not mocked." The apostle had evidently in his eye a certain course of conduct which he indignantly denounces as a "sneering at God." This feeling prompts him to accentuate his exhortation addressed to the cold-hearted, niggardly Christians whom he has in view, by adding this clause, which is in effect, "in every possible way;" namely, by giving them respect and good will as well as maintenance. To no other Church does he address such direct admonition respecting the liberal treatment of its teachers, though, perhaps, indirect admonition may be detected in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7-11</a>. No doubt the news he had just heard from Galatia made him feel the necessity of dealing with them roundly on this point.

But the derision will not last long; it cannot hold good, Whatever in our hypocrisy we may pretend, or even after a fashion believe, as to ourselves, the eternal principles of Divine government are sure to work out their accomplishment. Bishop Lightfoot, founding upon the use of the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> in Greek authors on rhetoric - with whom it denotes a kind of fine <span class="accented">irony</span>, in which a feeling of contempt is thinly veiled by a polite show of respect - proposes to apply this sense here; and it would well suit the tenor of the passage; but as employed by so Hellenistic a writer as St. Paul it appears safer to interpret the verb simply In the light thrown upon it by the usage of the Septuagint. <span class="cmt_word">For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also</span> <span class="cmt_word">reap</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x1fc3;</span> may be either an aorist, as in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>," whatsoever good thing each one doeth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>);" or a present. The latter seems to agree better with the <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> of the next verse, and the more pointedly directs attention to one's present immediate behaviour. The reaping-time is either the future life or its starting-point in the" day of the Lord" which determines its future complexion, as in <a href="../../par/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>. The axiom here stated holds good, no doubt, in much that befalls us in the present life, as is forcibly evinced by the late Fred. Robertson's sermon on this text; but this application of it hardly lies in the apostle's present field of view. All human activity is here recited under this image of "sowing," with reference to the consequences which in the day of retribution will infallibly accrue from every part of it. In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>, however ("He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly," etc.), the idea is applied to pecuniary gifts. Such an application seems to possess a peculiar propriety, founded on the benefits that the giving of money - which, viewed as gold, silver, or copper coins is in itself a dry and useless thing - would be the means of effecting (see vers. 12-15 of the same chapter). But this does not warrant our <span class="accented">limiting</span> the application of the word here to the bestowment of money gifts, though this in the context furnishes the occasion for its introduction; the next verse proves the wider application which the apostle's mind is making of it, not, however, losing sight (vers. 9, 10) of this specific reference. "Whatsoever he is sowing, that shall he reap;" the <span class="accented">quality</span> of the harvest (its quantity does not seem from the next verse to be particularly thought of, as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6</a>) is determined by the quality of the seed sown. In the form of expression, the deed which is done is said to be itself received back - received back, that is, in its corresponding reward or punishment. In a similar manner the apostle expresses himself in <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-8.htm">Ephesians 6:8</a>, "Whatsoever good thing each man doeth, this shall he receive again (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) from the Lord." So of evil doings in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>, "He that doeth wrong shall receive again the wrong which he did;" and of both good and bad in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>. These last-cited passages, together with others which will readily occur to the reader, appear to contemplate a reference to be made in the day of judgment to each several action, with an award assigned to each; which view is likewise presented by such utterances of Christ himself as we read in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35, 36, 42, 43</a>. On the other hand, in the passage now before us, the "eternal life," and probably also the "corruption" mentioned in ver. 8, seem to point to the general award, of life or of destruction, which each man shall receive, founded on the review of his whole behaviour (see <a href="../../par/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12, 15</a>). This is a somewhat different view of the future retribution from the former. Considering such passages in the light of moral exhortation, we are reminded that in each several action we are taking a step <span class="accented">towards</span> either a happy or a disastrous end - a step which, <span class="accented">if pursued onward in the same direction</span>, will infallibly conduct us to either that happy or that disastrous end. In regard to the relation between the two somewhat differing views of the future retribution above stated, when considered as subjects of speculative inquiry, a few observations may not be out of place here. We need find no difficulty at all in this diversity of representation so far as relates to the good actions of those who shall then be accepted or to the evil actions of those who shall be rejected. But a difficulty does seem to present itself with respect to the evil deeds done, if not before yet after their conversion, by the ultimately accepted, and also with respect to the good deeds done by the ultimately lost. Will the righteous receive the award of their evil  deeds? Will the lost receive the award of their good deeds? For there is no righteous man who hath not sinned; as also neither is there an unrighteous man whose life does not show good and laudable actions. A reference to the actual experience of souls in this life suggests, not indeed a complete solution of the difficulty which the nature of the case probably makes impossible to us at devise, but a consideration which helps to lessen our sense of it. It is this . in Christians who have a well-grounded consciousness of perfect reconciliation with God, assured to them even by the seal of the Spirit of adoption, this happy consciousness is, however, perfectly compatible with a vivid remembrance of wrong things done in the past. And this remembrance is perpetually suggestive of sentiments of self-loathing - self-loathing the more bitter in proportion as the soul, by its growing purification through the Spirit, is enabled the more truly to estimate the evil character of those evil deeds. This is exemplified by St. Paul's wailing recollection, near the very end of his course, of those heinous sins of his, committed long years before, against Christ and his Church (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). Now, we cannot conceive of a continuous existence of the soul apart from a continued remembrance of its past experiences. The redeemed, then, in their perfected state after the resurrection, can never become oblivions of those foul blots in their spiritual history; the recollection of them can never cease at once to abase them in their own consciousness and to glorify the grace which has redeemed them. The Divine Spirit itself will still, we may believe, quicken these remembrances; and the infinite benefactions of God, in that state of felicity experienced, will be still heaping fresh coals of fire upon their heads. Their felicity will be no offspring of blindness or misconception in reference to the past; on the contrary, they will know the truth in respect to their own lives in respect to every part of them, with a clearness unattainable in the present state; but they will know the truth too in respect to the intensity of the Divine love. God's love, it is true, cannot shed the light of approval upon those dark spots of their earthly history; cannot shed upon them those felicitating beams of "Well done, good and faithful servant," which will most assuredly flow down upon the acceptable portions of their conduct; that love itself cannot deal with his servants otherwise than according to truth. But the love of God will be clearly seen, cancelling, for Christ's sake, the penal consequences which but for Christ those several wickednesses would have incurred: in those very instances of sinfulness magnifying in each saved one's consciousness the infinite benignity of his Father, which loved him even then, in those very hours of his extremest ill-deserving. If these speculations appear not unreasonable, then they will serve to explain in what way the sinful doings even of those finally accepted will, however, not fail of receiving their award; the award will be there, both in that sense of loss - loss of Divine commendation, which will necessarily accompany the recollection of them; and also in the sense of their debt of punishment, though cancelled. Be we sure our sin will find us out.

This is the case also in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-18.htm">Ephesians 2:18</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-16.htm">Philippians 4:16</a>. In regard to the connection of this first half of the eighth verse with the preceding context, we must take note of the sternly monitory tone which marks ver. 7. This shows that in the sentence, "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap," the apostle has more immediately in view the terrible harvest to be reaped by those who acted as if they thought that God might be overreached. We may infer from this that this first clause of ver. 8 is mainly the thought which <span class="accented">up to here</span> the writer had it on his mind to inculcate - the "corruption" which a man would reap from a life of self-indulgence. But, after completing the statement of this thought, his tone forthwith changes; the frown clearing away from his countenance, he adds, to the threatening admonition of the first clause, the cheering promise of the second, while a more genial tone marks his further remarks on the subject in vers. 9 and 10. The second limb of the verse thus appears introduced in the same way as the second does in <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; and in both cases with the conjunction <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>. "Sowing unto his own flesh." Many critics render, "into his own flesh," as if, with a shifting of the image, which is certainly not uncommon with St. Paul, the flesh were now the ground into which the seed is cast. This relation, however, to the verb "sow" (see Alford and Ellicott) is in the New Testament expressed differently, by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, in, or by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, upon; while <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a> denotes "among." It is more obvious to take <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> as "unto," "denoting the immediate object of the action, that to which it tends, that in which it terminates" (Webster and Wilkinson, 'Commentary'). This way of construing suits better in the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, which follows. Applying the image of sowing generally, the apostle in ver. 7 speaks of the quality of the sowing (not precisely the quality of the seed) as determining the quality of the harvest; and here, of one kind of sowing being "unto the flesh," the other "unto the Spirit." "He that soweth unto his own flesh;" that is, he whose general action in life is referred to his own personal gratification in his lower nature - to his own profit, pleasure, honour. The addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;</span> ("his own") has a marked reference to the topic which led to this general statement: the apostle has in his view a man's gratifying his own merely worldly inclinations, to the disregard of the well-being, even the physical well-being, of other men. To sow unto the flesh of our brethren, in one sense, namely, for the promotion of <span class="accented">their</span> physical well-being, would bear a different aspect from sowing unto oar own flesh. "Shall from the flesh reap corruption." This by some commentators has been interpreted thus: In the harvest of That Day, nought will be found with him of all those things on which his heart has been set - nought save, at the best, mere rottenness, disappointment, and illusion. This would be analogous to the moral with which our Lord pointed his parable of the rich fool, to whom God said, "Whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?" "So is he," added Christ, "that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God" (<a href="../../par/luke/12-20.htm">Luke 12:20, 21</a>). The word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, corruption, involves at least as much as this; but this view alone would furnish an inadequate antitheten to "eternal life," as also it gives less force to the word itself than it appears from its ordinary use to convey. One essential element of this verbal noun <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> is the notion of <span class="accented">decay</span>, or the condition of being <span class="accented">impaired</span>, <span class="accented">spoilt</span>, <span class="accented">wasted away</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-21.htm">Romans 8:21</a>), It is used of corruption in our moral nature in <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-12.htm">2 Peter 2:12, 19</a>; as <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> are likewise applied in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5</a>. But the clear presentment of its sense, when connected as it is here with "flesh," is afforded by its antithesis, with respect to the "body" or "flesh," to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>, "It is sown in <span class="accented">corruption.</span>, it is raised <span class="accented">in incorruption</span>," and ibid., 1 Corinthians 15:50," Neither doth <span class="accented">corruption</span> inherit <span class="accented">incorruption</span>;" and by the opposed adjectives "corruptible" and "incorruptible ' (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53, 54</a>, as well as by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span> of the rotting away of a dead body, in <a href="../../par/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27, 31</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34-37</a>. That the apostle uses the word "corruption" with a direct reference to "flesh," and therefore as alluding to or rather expressing a certain qualification of the flesh's condition, is shown by his inserting the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "of the flesh." Strictly speaking those words are not necessary for the completeness of the sentence. To all appearance they are added <span class="accented">aetiologically</span>, to make prominent the thought that what is sown unto the flesh may be expected to issue in corruption, because corruption is the natural end of flesh itself. For an analogous reason, "of the Spirit" is inserted in the antithetic statement; the Spirit being essentially not only living, but vivific. The words, then, seem to mean this' "shall from the flesh reap that corruption which the flesh, un-quickened by the Spirit of God [for comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>], must itself issue in." In endeavouring more exactly to determine the sense of these words, it is well in the first instance to confine our view to the conceptions relative to this subject presented by St. Paul. In reviewing these, we observe that St. Paul never predicates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> ("incorruption," "incorruptible-ness") of the future bodily condition of "those who perish (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)." On the contrary, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42-54</a> he clearly restricts this conception of bodily being to the case of those whose body shall be assimilated to that of the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, as indeed it is only to them that the entire discourse (vers. 20-58) relates. So again in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>, the "fashioning anew of the body of our humiliation into conformity with the body of his glory" is evidently limited to those whoso end is not "perdition (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>)." Again, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a> the "house not made with hands, eternal," appears to be an exclusive designation of the resurrection-body of the accepted believer. Once more, in <a href="../../par/romans/2-7.htm">Romans 2:7</a> the words, "to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honour and incorruption (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)," imply that incorruption is an attribute exclusively pertaining to the happiness after which true Christians aspire. All that we meet with elsewhere in St. Paul's writings fits in perfectly with his holding the view that, while "there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust," as he stated to Felix (<a href="../../par/acts/24-15.htm">Acts 24:15</a>) - a resurrection surely he meant in the body - the bodies of the accepted alone wilt be incorruptible, the bodies of the lost being, for all that appears in his teaching, left in some sense subject to corruption. In what way the apostle in his own mind connected this conception, of in-corruption being a quality exclusively pertaining to the future condition of the just. with that of the "eternal destruction (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" awaiting them who know not God (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:9</a>), we shall, perhaps,  do wisely in not attempting to determine. We can, it is true, <span class="accented">imagine</span> ways of conjoining the two notions; 'but it will be best not to positively affirm that <span class="accented">this</span> or that that was St. Paul's manner of viewing the subject. Possibly the Spirit had not revealed this to him. if so, he might feel it incumbent upon him to forbear from giving forth definite statements on matters not really disclosed to his view, and, therefore, not intended to form a part of revealed truth. This, however, should not keep us back from accepting what appears to be the only probable view of the sense of the present passage, namely, that they who live a life of selfishness and carnal self-indulgence will reap the final award of having a body with flesh, in some most real and important sense, subject to corruption. The consideration that the apostle is thinking of the awards of the day of judgment, at once meets the objection that corruption is predicable of the Christian's body also. It is obvious to reply that, though the body of a believer is sown in corruption even as the body of an unrighteous man, it is revealed to us that it will be raised in incorruption; which it is nowhere said that the body of him who dies in his sins will be. As applied to objects lying on the other side of the veil which parts the spiritual world from that visible world whence all our images of thought are derived, this term "corruption" must be understood as describing a condition of bodily being, not necessarily identical with, but very conceivably only in some respects analogous to, that which it describes in relation to a corpse in our present state. The resurrection stale, with all that pertains to it, inscrutably blending, as the story, of the forty days commencing with Christ s resurrection exemplifies, spiritual phenomena with corporeal, is one which we are wholly unable to understand or to realize. This may be thought a very superfluous observation. But it is not so. The attempts intellectually to realize the events which we are hereafter to witness and to be the subjects of, and the dogmatic affirmations relating to them, made, not merely in past ages, but in the very present, render it necessary that we should distinctly keep this truth in view. The physical theory of that future state, and the eventual history which is to be evolved in it, we not merely do not know, but are absolutely incapable of forecasting. We dare not say one syllable about them beyond what is distinctly told us; and what <span class="accented">is</span> told us, we are to remember, is through the very nature of the case no other than images, presented in a dark dim mirror, which shows them so obscurely, that to our intellective perception they seem riddles rather than revelations: <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-12.htm">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>). It is, in fact, not our intellect, but our moral sense, that the revelations of the future state are designed to inform. Next, looking out from the field of purely Pauline doctrine upon the teaching presented in other parts of the New Testament, we are reminded at once of that awful and repeated word of our Lord concerning the "Gehenna of fire" <span class="accented">-</span> "where their worm (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3be;</span>) dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" (<a href="../../par/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-48</a>). It is known that, before our Lord appeared upon earth, this conception of Gehenna, the terms of which beyond question were borrowed from the closing verses of Isaiah, had already become current in the eschatological views of the Jews. This is evidenced by Judith 16:17; Ecclus. 7:17. This imagery our Lord adopted, recognizing, it should seem, in this portion of rabbinical teaching a just evolution of ideas which had been presented in the inspired volumes of the Old Testament - a development of them which we may fairly attribute to the guiding influence of the Holy Spirit promised to God's restored people, as <span class="accented">e.g</span>, in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24-28</a>. We cannot doubt that the "<span class="accented">worm"</span> which our Lord spoke of means the worm which preys upon rotting flesh. The image, therefore, exactly accords with the word "<span class="accented">corruption"</span> as interpreted above. Whether the apostle glanced at that discourse of Christ, or was even aware of it, is uncertain; but that he both knew of it and even inferred from it in using this word "<span class="accented">corruption</span>," is by no means unlikely. One other reference to "<span class="accented">corruption"</span> as the future doom of at least certain of the lost, is found in <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-12.htm">2 Peter 2:12</a>, which, according to the now approved reading of the Greek text, runs thus: "But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed - shall in their destroying be destroyed [or, 'in their corruption shall even rot away'] (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." Possibly the word <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, taken as "corruption," points here to moral corruption; but the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> may very well point to the miserable doom of rotting away by which they shall judicially perish, moral corruption working physical corruption. But the exact sense is doubtful. With the clause before us we must group <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, "If ye live after the flesh, ye are certain to die;" whilst the sentence which follows, "But if by the Spirit ye put to death the doings of the body, ye shall live," answers to the closing sentence of the present verse; as also does "death" as "the wages of sin," balanced against the "eternal life" which is "the gift of God," in <a href="../../par/romans/6.htm">Romans 6</a>:25. The contrasted thoughts in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-19.htm">Philippians 3:19, 20</a>  likewise closely touch those here presented to us. <span class="cmt_word">But he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">but he that soweth unto the Spirit</span>, <span class="accented">shall of the Spirit reap life eternal.</span> That is, he that expends thought, time, effort, money, upon the furthering, in himself and in others, of the fruits of the Spirit, shall receive, from that Holy Spirit to whose guidance dwelling within him he resigns himself, that quickening of his whole being, body, soul, and spirit, for an everlasting existence in glory, which it is the proper work of that Divine Agent to effect. For the latter clause, comp. <a href="../../par/romans/8-11.htm">Romans 8:11</a>, "If the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwelleth in you [as the guiding, animating influence in your lives], he that raised up Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit dwelling within you;" in which passage the aetiologleal clause, "by reason of his Spirit dwelling in you," corresponds exactly with the aetiological clause, "of the Spirit," in the words before us. The two verses which follow show that one specific form of sowing unto the Spirit which the apostle has definitely in view, while enforcing the general idea, is that of Christian beneficence. How closely the practice of Christian beneficence was in the apostle's mind, in conformity with Christ's own teaching (<a href="../../par/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>. etc.), connected with the securing of the future blissful immortality, is markedly shown in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18, 19</a>; - not the less so if we adopt the <span class="accented">now</span> approved reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "that they may lay hold on the life which is life indeed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And let us not be weary in well-doing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> [Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>]); <span class="accented">but in doing that which is good</span>, <span class="accented">let us not flag.</span> That is, some sow unto their own flesh, some unto the Spirit; let us be of those who do that which is commendable; and not that only; let us do it with an unflagging spirit. Such seems to be the swaying of thought in the sentence; hence the position of the participial phrase before the verb: the participle is not a mere qualification of the verb, as it is in the rendering, "Let us not be weary in well-doing," and as it is in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; but, with an implied exhortation that such should be the case, it supposes that we are of the better class, and founds upon the supposition the exhortation not to flag. "That which is commendable (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>)" recites, not works of beneficence only, but every species of moral excellence, comprising in brief the enumeration given in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, all of which is included in "sowing unto the Spirit," The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> occurs in five other places of the New Testament - <a href="../../par/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-13.htm">Ephesians 3:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>. In every one of these six passages some of the manuscripts present the variant reading of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, which in all is adopted in the Textus Receptus, but is in all replaced with the general consent of recent editors by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is, indeed, questioned whether <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is ever used by any Greek author. The difference in meaning is material: <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to be bad in doing a thing; while <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, would probably mean to be so bad at a course of action as to leave it <span class="accented">off</span> altogether. In the first four of the above-cited passages it is tendered in the Authorized Version by "faint;" whilst in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a> and here it is rendered "be weary," that is, "flag." In all the notion of flagging appears the most suitable, and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-1.htm">2 Corinthians 4:1, 16</a> necessary. In the present passage the course of thought requires us to understand it as not so strong a word as <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Critics point attention to the play of phrase in connecting the expression, doing that which is <span class="accented">commendable</span> or good, with the verb denoting being <span class="accented">bad</span> at doing it. So in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The epigrammatic combination would seem to have been a favourite one with St. Paul, occurring as it does in two letters written several years apart. Such playfulness is not foreign to his style. The use of the first person plural <span class="accented">may</span> be merely cohortative, as above in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-24.htm">Galatians 5:24</a>. But it may also he a real self-exhortation as well. In the long, long, weary, arduous conflict which St. Paul was waging throughout his Christian career, the flesh must often have felt weak, and have required the application of this goad. And this tone of personal feeling may, perhaps, be further discerned in the use of the phrase, "in due season;" the blessed reaping of joy may seem to us at times long in coming; but God's time for its coming will be the best time; let us, therefore, be resigned to wait for that. This seems to be the tone of the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in its own times," of <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For in due season we shall reap, if we faint</span> <span class="cmt_word">not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)<span class="accented">. for at its own season we shall reap</span>, <span class="accented">if we faint not.</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is the season assigned to an event in the counsels of God; as in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in his season," of the revelation of the "man of lawlessness." <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is used in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a> with reference, as here, to the day of judgment; and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a> and <a href="../../par/titus/1-3.htm">Titus 1:3</a>, of the manifestation of the gospel. In every case the phrase appears to intimate that the season appointed by God, though not what man might have anticipated or wished, was, however, to be acquiesced in as wisest  and best (see last note). The reaping is the same as that referred to in the previous two verses. "If we faint not." The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2</a> is to faint physically from exhaustion. In <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-3.htm">Hebrews 12:3, 5</a> it is used of succumbing, giving in, morally; not merely feeling weak, but in consequence of weakness giving up all further effort. In this latter sense it occurs in the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a> and in 1 Macc. 9:8. And this last is its meaning here. It expresses more than the flagging of spirit before mentioned; for that would not forfeit the reward of past achievement, unless it led to the actual relinquishment of further endeavour; this last would forfeit it (comp. <a href="../../par/revelation/3-11.htm">Revelation 3:11</a> and <a href="../../par/2_john/1-8.htm">2 John 1:8</a>). Taking it thus, there is no occasion for understanding this phrase, "not fainting," as several of the Greek commentators do, including apparently Chrysostom, as if it meant thus: "We shall reap without any fear of fainting or becoming weary any more;" which surely, as Alford observes, gives a vapid turn to the sentence.

Winer, 'Gram. N.T.,' &sect; 53, 8<span class="accented">a</span>) peculiar to him (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-18.htm">Romans 5:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-3.htm">Romans 7:3, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-12.htm">Romans 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>). In every instance it marks a certain pause after a statement of premisses; in several, following a citation from the Old Testament; the writer, after waiting, so to speak, for the reader duly to Lake into his mind what has been already said, proceeds to draw his inference. The <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> seems to point backward to the premisses; the <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> to introduce the inference. "Well, then," or "so, then," appears a fairly equivalent rendering. In <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:6</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span> introduces a cohortative verb, as here; in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:15</a>, an imperative. The words Which follow seem to be commonly understood as meaning "whenever opportunity offers." But this fails short of recognizing the solemn consideration of the proprieties of the present sowing-time, which the previous context prepares us to expect to find here; the term "season," as Meyer remarks, having its proper reference already fixed by the antithetical season of reaping referred to in ver. 9. Moreover, instead of for, would not the apostle, if he had meant "whenever," have used the intensified form <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span>? Chrysostom gives the sense well thus: "As it is not always in our power to sow, so neither is it to show mercy; when we have been borne hence, though we may desire it a thousand times, we shall be able to effect nothing." Indeed it is questionable whether the sense now pleaded for is not that which was intended by the rendering in the Authorized Version. The particle <span class="greek">&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;</span> probably means "while," as it does in <a href="../../par/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a> and in <a href="../../par/john/12-35.htm">John 12:35, 36</a>, where it should replace the <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> of the Textus Receptus; but this needs not to be insisted upon. Anyway, we are reminded of the uncertain tenure by which we hold the season for doing that which, if done, will have so blessed a consequence. <span class="cmt_word">Let us do good unto all men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">let us be workers of that which is good towards all men.</span> The verbs <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;</span> appear used inter-changeably in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a> and <a href="../../par/3_john/1-5.htm">3 John 1:5</a>; but the former seems to suggest, more vividly than the other, either the concrete action, the <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, which is wrought; or else the part enacted by the agent as being a worker of such or such a description - as if, here, it were "let us be benefactors." The adjective "good" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) is often, perhaps most commonly, used to designate what is morally excellent in general; thus, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in <a href="../../par/romans/2-10.htm">Romans 2:10</a>, "the worker of that which is go,d" is contrasted with "the worker-out of that which is evil," as a description of a man's moral character in general. But on the other hand, this adjective frequently takes the sense of "benevolent," "beneficent;" as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>, "Is thine eye evil, because I am good?" <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, "masters, not only the good and gentle, but also the froward;" <a href="../../par/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>. In the remarkable contrast between the righteous man and the good man in <a href="../../par/romans/5-7.htm">Romans 5:7</a> (see Dr. Gifford's note on the passage, 'Speaker's Commentary,' p. 123), the latter term appears distinctly intended in the conception of virtuousness to make especially prominent the idea of beneficence. Naturally, this sense attaches to it, when it describes an action <span class="accented">done to another</span>, as the opposite to the "working ill to one's neighbour," mentioned in <a href="../../par/romans/13-10.htm">Romans 13:10</a>; "good" in such a relation, denoting what is beneficent in effect, denotes what is also benevolent in intention (see <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>). Indeed, that the present clause points to works of beneficence" is made certain by that which is added, "and especially," etc.; for our behaviour should be in no greater degree marked by general moral excellence in dealing with one class of men than in dealing with any others; though <span class="accented">one particular branch</span> of virtuous action may be called into varying degrees of activity in different relations of human intercourse. "Towards all men;" <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, towards, as in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>. The spirit of universal philanthropy which the apostle inculcates  here as in other passages, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:15</a>, is one which flows naturally from the proper influence upon the mind of the great facts stated in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-3.htm">1 Timothy 2:3-7</a>, as also it was a spirit which in a most eminent degree animated the apostle's own life. Witness that noble outburst of universal benevolence which we read of in <a href="../../par/acts/26-29.htm">Acts 26:29</a>. Such an escape from bigotry and <span class="accented">particularism</span> was quite novel to the Gentile world, and scarcely heard of in the Jewish, though beautifully pointed forward to in the teaching of the Book of Jonah (see Introduction to the Book of Jonah, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. 6. p. 576). <span class="cmt_word">Espescially</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto them who are of the household of faith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">but especially towards them that are of the household of faith.</span> The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> occurs in the New Testament only in St. Paul's Epistles - twice besides here, namely, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>, "fellow-citizens with the saints, and <span class="accented">of the household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>)of God;" and in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, "if any provideth not for his own, and specially <span class="accented">his own household</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." In the last-cited passage, the adjective, denoting as it plainly is meant to do, a closer relation than "his own (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" must mean members of his household or family; and we can hardly err in supposing that in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a> likewise the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> denotes those whom God has admitted into his family as children. So the word also signifies in the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-5.htm">Isaiah 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; and <a href="../../par/revelation/18-6.htm">Revelation 18:6, 12, 13</a>. It is, therefore, an unnecessary dilution of its force here to render it, "those who belong to the faith," though such a rendering of it might be justified if found in an ordinary Greek author. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> is illustrated by the strong personification used before by the apostle in <a href="../../par/galatians/3-23.htm">Galatians 3:23, 25</a>,  "before faith came;" "shut up for the faith which was yet to be revealed;" "now that faith is come." The apostle surely here is not thinking of "the Christian doctrine," but of that principle of believing acceptance of God's promises which he has been insisting upon all through the Epistle. This principle, again personified, is here the patron or guardian of God's people afore-time under a <span class="accented">pedagogue</span>: "of the household of faith," not "of the faith." The apostle is thinking of those who sympathized with the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ without legal observances; and very possibly is glancing in particular at the teachers under whose care the apostle had left the Galatian Churches. At first, we may believe, the Galatian Churchmen, in the fervour of their affection to the apostle himself, had been willing enough to help those teachers in every way. But when relaxing their hold upon the fundamental principles of the gospel, they had also declined in their affectionate maintenance of the teachers who upheld those doctrines. He now commends these, belonging to faith's own household, to their especial regard (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>). "Especially;" this qualification in an intensified form of the precept of universal beneficence, is the outcome of no cold calculation of relative duties, but of fervent love towards those who are truly brethren in Christ. That to these an especial affection is due above all others is a sentiment commended and inculcated in almost all St. Paul's Epistles; as it is also by St. Peter, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>, etc.; and again by St. John. With all, "love of brethren (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)" is a different sentiment from that sentiment of charity which is due to all fellow-men; that is, it is an intensified form of this latter, exalted into a peculiar tenderness of regard by the admixture of higher relations than those which antecedently connect true Christians with all members of the human family. Christ has himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>) taught his disciples that he deems a peculiar regard to be due from them to those "his brethren" who at that day shall be on his right hand; meaning, evidently, by "these my brethren," not suffering men, women, or children as such, but sufferers peculiarly belonging to himself (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/18-5.htm">Matthew 18:5, 6</a>). Thus we see that, after all, there is a <span class="accented">particularism</span> properly characteristic of Christian sentiment; only, not such a particularism as a Gentile, and too often a Jew likewise, would have formulated thus: "Thou shalt love thine own people and hate the alien;" but one which may be formulated thus: "Thou shalt love every man, but especially thy fellow-believer in Christ." The reader will, perhaps, scarcely need to be reminded of Keble's exquisite piece on the Second Sunday after Trinity in the 'Christian Year.'

What appears to the present writer the most probable view he must explain as  briefly as he is able. The interrogative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means "how great," as in <a href="../../par/zechariah/2-2.htm">Zechariah 2:2</a> (Septuagint); <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>. Accordingly, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> in Polyb., 1:2, 8 (cited in Liddell and Scott's 'Lexicon') means "how many and how large." Many, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Chrysostom, have supposed that the word includes a reference to clumsiness, ungainliness, as attaching to the apostle's handwriting ("with what big letters!'). But no example of the word being used in this sense of "ungainliness" has been adduced; and it seems safer not to import into its rendering this additional shade of meaning. The dative <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> Bishop Lightfoot proposes to connect closely with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> are often used in familiar style, with the sense <span class="accented">mark you</span>! But there is no instance of this use of the dative pronoun in the Greek Testament (see Winer, 'Gram. N. T.,' &sect; 22, 7, Anna. 2, p. 140); and here surely it more naturally connects itself with <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;</span>. It is not uncommon with St. Paul to insert some word or words between a substantive and its adjective or dependent genitive, as here between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> (see <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-15.htm">Galatians 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>, etc.). In the instances now cited there appears no more logical occasion for such a seeming disarrangement of the words than there does here. The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> is used with no objective accusative following, as in <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>; the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> being in the dative, because the apostle is referring merely to the <span class="accented">form</span> of the medium of communication, and not to the substance of the communication itself. The rendering of the Authorized Version, "how large a letter I have written," cannot be defended as a literal translation, though it may be allowed on one view of the passage to give the sense rightly. But though the plural noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, in ordinary Greek, like <span class="accented">literae</span> in Latin, sometimes occurs in the sense of a single epistle or letter, it is never so used by St. Paul, who always employs the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f74;</span> to express this notion, which he does no less than seventeen times. In <a href="../../par/acts/28-21.htm">Acts 28:21</a> it is rendered "letters," in the plural number; being properly "communications in writing." The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> was the word ordinarily employed in Greek to designate a letter of the alphabet. It also denotes "a writing," as when in the plural we read in <a href="../../par/john/5-47.htm">John 5:47</a>, "if ye believe not his writings," and in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15</a>," the sacred writings," or Scriptures. In <a href="../../par/luke/16-6.htm">Luke 16:6, 7</a> "take thy bill" is literally, "take thy writings" (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> being the now accepted reading in the Greek text). In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a>, "the ministration of death in writings," the word probably refers to the ten commandments, each forming one writing; though it <span class="accented">may</span> mean "in characters of writing." In ordinary Greek it sometimes denotes a passage of a treatise or book (Liddell and Scott, under the word, 2:4). Next <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span> ("I have written") may be understood, as in <a href="../../par/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15</a>, "I have written the more boldly unto you," etc., with reference to the entire letter, now nearly complete, as it lies before him. In that case the apostle's words may be rendered, "See, with what long writings [or, 'pieces of writing'] I have written unto you with mine own hand." Through some cause or other, we know not what the cause was, writing with his own hand was not a welcome employment to him; so far unwelcome that he generally devolved the actual penning of his letters upon an amanuensis, merely authenticating each letter as his own by a postscript added in his own hand (see <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3</a>. <span class="accented">fin</span>.). Perhaps Philemon forms the only' exception (see ver. 19), apart from this letter to the Galatians. We may, therefore, imagine the apostle as painfully and laboriously penning one portion after another of the Epistle; often pausing weariedly in the work as he came to the end of each <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that is, to the end of each section of his argument, each seeming to him a long and toilsome effort. And now at last he exclaims," Look, what long, laborious performances of handwriting I have achieved in writing to you! And from that learn how deeply I am concerned on your behalf, and how grave your present spiritual peril appears to me to be!" Ordinarily it was only a brief "piece of writing" that he wrote with his own hand; here, long pieces, added one after another with painful effort. Or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the verb "I have written" may be referred to what the apostle is now beginning to pen, not merely because the epistolary style of the ancients, Greek and Roman, was wont to place the writer of a letter in the temporal standing-point of its recipient, as when Cicero dates his letters <span class="accented">scribebam Id</span>., etc., but because under some circumstances it is natural that the writer should thus refer himself to the view of his correspondent. Thus in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-19.htm">Philemon 1:19</a>, "I Paul have written it (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;</span>) with mine own hand, I will repay it." It would be quite obvious to ourselves to express our meaning in the same manner. So far, then, as such considerations reach, it appears quite supposable that the apostle, having employed an amanuensis as usual as far as the end of ver. 10, then himself took up the pen for the customary addition of an authenticating postscript; and that, for the purpose of adding especial emphasis to the postscript which he here thought advisable to add, he made his handwriting most unusually large, and that it is to this emphatic style  of penmanship that he here draws attention. Many modern critics have acquiesced in this explanation; and if <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> means "<span class="accented">letters</span>," that is, characters of the writing, it seems the most probable; for it does not seem likely that the whole Epistle was written in letters of an extraordinary size; while, if the characters were those of his ordinary style of penmanship, the remark would be too trivial to come from him. The present writer inclines to the former method of interpretation.

They were Gentile Christians and not Jews; this appears from their not themselves wishing to keep the Law; for if they had been Jews, the external observance of the Law, being natural to them from their infancy, would have been with them a matter of course: St. Paul himself would probably not have urged them to relinquish it. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is not found by the critics in any earlier Greek writer, though the adjective <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, fair-faced, is used of "specious" answers in Herodotus (7:168), and "specious words" conjoined with "fables" in Demosthenes ('De Corinthians,' p. 277). Aristophanes uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> ('Nub.,' 362) to "<span class="accented">carry</span> a solemn and worshipful face." The notion of falsity, plainly hinted by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, reminds us, Bishop Lightfoot observes, of our Lord's words respecting whited sepulchres, which "outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly," etc. (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, face, in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-12.htm">2 Corinthians 5:12</a>, "<span class="accented">glory</span> in <span class="accented">appearance</span>, and not in heart." As the aorist of verbs denoting a certain state frequently expresses an entrance upon such a state (see <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> above, <a href="../../par/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19</a> and note), it probably is intimated that the persons referred to were conscious that their "<span class="accented">outward</span> appearance" was hitherto not acceptable to Jewish minds, but that they now were desirous of making it so. Time had been when they did not care so much about it. "In the flesh." This word "flesh" not unfrequently designates men's condition as unmodified by the Spirit of God; as when the apostle speaks of "<span class="accented">being</span> in the flesh" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-5.htm">Romans 7:5</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-8.htm">Romans 8:8, 9</a>): thence also circumstances or relations pertaining to this unspiritual condition, as in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-3.htm">Philippians 3:3, 4</a>; where the apostle speaks of "having confidence in the flesh," and goes on, in vers. 5, 6, to enumerate some of those circumstances or relations. Thus, again, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>, "ye, the Gentiles in the flesh," that is, who in that state of things in which men lived before the spiritual economy intervened, were the "uncircumcision (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>)," while the Jews were the "<span class="accented">circumcision."</span> But as the distinction between these two classes was signalized by an external corporeal mark, the apostle in that passage immediately after uses the expression, "in the flesh," in a varied sense, with reference to this latter, "that which is called circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands." With similar variation of meaning the word "<span class="accented">flesh"</span> is used here. The Christians spoken of, losing sight of the cross of Christ and the Spirit's work, were becoming possessed by feelings belonging to the old "<span class="accented">carnal"</span> relations between Jews and Gentiles, and so were making it their ambition to figure with advantage in the eyes of the circumcision, as well as to escape their enmity. And then, as in the passage just referred to (<a href="../../par/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11</a>), the apostle passes from this sense of the phrase, "in the flesh," to another relating to corporeal flesh; for this he does in the next verse, in the words, "that they may glory in your flesh." <span class="cmt_word">They constrain you to be circumcised</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">these compel you to be circumcised.</span> "Compel;" the same verb as was used above (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-14.htm">Galatians 2:14</a>) of St. Peter's attitude towards the Gentile believers at Antioch. <span class="accented">As here applied</span>, <span class="accented">it means</span> "<span class="accented">advise</span>," "<span class="accented">urge</span>," argue for it as right and necessary for salvation, insist upon it as a condition of friendship. "These;" not, perhaps, meaning "<span class="accented">these</span> only," "<span class="accented">none</span> but these;" it appears enough to suppose that the apostle, from definite information which he had received, was persuaded that some of those who took the lead in urging onward the Judaizing movement were led to join in it by the cowardly motives here described. With indignant scorn, he says," As surely as a man wants to stand well with the world, so surely will he be found with these circumcisers."<span class="cmt_word">Only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> [Textus Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>]); <span class="accented">only that they may not by means of the cross of Christ suffer persecution.</span> "Only that;" that is, for no other reason than that. The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> is thrust out of its proper position in the sentence (which is that assigned to it in the Textus Receptus) by the fervent of the writer's feelings. To himself the cross of Christ seemed the centre of all glory and blessedness; to be connected with it he would be well pleased to suffer martyrdom; but these men could be well content to shelve it out of sight, and, in fact, were doing so; and  what for? because the Jews did not like it, and they did not wish to get into trouble by offending <span class="accented">them</span>! A grand disdain prompts the apostle, at the cost of impairing the smooth run of the sentence, to (as it were) balance against each other the "cross of Christ" and "not being persecuted." The construction of the dative to express "by means of," that by which a certain result is brought about, is not very common; but we have it in <a href="../../par/romans/11-20.htm">Romans 11:20</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and ibid., 30, <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>: <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-12.htm">2 Corinthians 2:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>. Our attention is in this passage again drawn to the manner in which the Jews regarded "the word of the cross" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>), as that "word" was unfolded by St. Paul and received by his disciples among the Gentiles. The great point of offence (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) in the apostle's teaching respecting it lay in his presenting its pollution in the view of the Law, as inferring the abrogation of the ceremonial institute itself. On this account the Jews could not abide him nor those who attached themselves to him as their teacher, though in a degree able to put up with Christians not anti-Judaists. To the Galatians he had presented "Christ crucified" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-1.htm">Galatians 3:1</a>) as <span class="accented">he</span> saw him to be, and they had accepted the doctrine. But now some, at least, of them were beginning to feel uneasy at observing how the Jews in their neighbourhood regarded Paul and those who attached themselves closely to Paul. Had not the Jews (they felt) high claims to consideration? Were they not the original depositaries of the oracles of God? Was not their religion venerable for its antiquity, magnificent in its temple and ritual, and in origin Divine? To these new converts from the gross spiritual darkness and degradation of heathenism, some of them, perhaps, drawn from it originally by the teaching of non-Christian Jews, the adherents to the ancient faith would naturally appear entitled to high respect - respect which they themselves were also not backward in claiming (see <a href="../../par/romans/2-19.htm">Romans 2:19, 20</a>). When the personal influence exercised upon their minds by the holy love and fervour of the apostle had through his absence begun to wane, they also, we may imagine, began to get disheartened, by feeling that their Christian discipleship was viewed with disfavour by their Jewish neighbours, by reason of its Pauline complexion; that on this account the Jews looked upon themselves, though worshippers of the same God, as unworthy of notice; nay, were even disposed to point them out to the surrounding heathens, only too willing to follow up the hint, as proper objects of contempt and ill usage (see for illustration, <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18.htm">Acts 18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14-16</a>). And herewith we have to bear in mind also that Judaism was in Roman jurisprudence treated as a tolerated religion (<span class="accented">religio licita</span>); and that, as long as Christians were regarded as belonging to a sect or branch of Judaism, they might seem to be entitled, in the eyes of Roman law, to the same toleration as the Jews themselves enjoyed. But if the Jews cast them off or disowned them they might forfeit such immunity, and become liable to be treated, not only by mobs, but by the Roman law itself, as offenders. The persons, then, here censured by the apostle may be supposed to have pursued the course they did with the idea that, by making themselves acceptable to the Jews through the adoption to a limited extent of Jewish ceremonies, and especially through the acceptance in their own person and the urging upon others of circumcision, they would relieve themselves of "the offence of the cross" (ch. 5:4). Without ceasing to be Christians, they would wipe themselves clear of the odium which with the Jews attached to Paul and those who held with Paul. Such seems to be the situation to which St. Paul's words allude. Bishop Lightfoot interprets it somewhat differently.

"For;" pointing back to the words," only that," "for no other reason than that," of the previous verse. The apostle means, it is from no zeal for the Law itself that they do what they do, for they are at no pains to keep the Law; but only with the object of currying favour with the Jews. The present participle <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> is the reading more generally accepted, though the perfect <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> has a competing amount of documentary authentication. The perfect is so much the easier reading to understand ("not even those who have actually been circumcised") as to be much more likely to be a correction displacing <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> than the converse hypothesis of the latter being a correction of the other borrowed from ver. 3. "They who are being circumcised" may be understood of a party, <span class="accented">including those who first set the movement ageing</span>, who were one after another undergoing the rite. Another turn is given to this participial phrase, as meaning "who are eager for circumcision," "who are all for being circumcised, the circumcision  party." Bishop Lightfoot is in favour of this view, referring to "the apt quotation" from an apocryphal book, in which the phrase appears used in this very sense (see his note). It is a sense grammatically difficult to sustain from the usage of the New Testament; for <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>, which has been cited on its behalf, does not bear it out. But the passion of scorn with which the apostle writes make the supposed strain upon strict grammatical propriety not altogether improbable. "Themselves;" this is inserted with allusion to the zeal shown by those men, both the first promoters and those drawn in by them, in urging upon <span class="accented">others</span> the observance, not indeed of the whole Law, but of certain of its prescriptions. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> is used similarly in <a href="../../par/romans/2-26.htm">Romans 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>. The sense seems founded upon the notion of watching the Law to see what it requires, as one is endeavouring to carry it out. The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, though specifically denoting the Law of Moses, as in <a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25, 27</a>, and often. <span class="cmt_word">But desire to have</span> <span class="cmt_word">you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">but they desire you to receive circumcision</span>, <span class="accented">that in your flesh they may have whereof to glory.</span> The conjunction <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;</span> is used in its proper original sense, "instead of that." All that they want is that in their intercourse with the Jews they may have your circumcision to refer to as evidence of the high respect which they and you as influenced by them have for the Law. "See! so far from trampling upon the Law, we and these our brethren too are adopting the very badge of the servants of the Law." The word "flesh" is in this clause used in its strictly literal signification. The account which the apostle here gives of the motives actuating this particular section of Judaizing reactionaries was no doubt grounded on specific information which he had just received. But such information, both in respect to its general probability and to its grave importance, was doubtless corroborated to his own mind by large experience which he had had elsewhere among the Gentile Churches of the behaviour of unsteady and imperfectly instructed Gentile converts. In almost every important place where Gentiles were won to the faith, there were previously existing communities of Jews (<a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a>); and contact with these must have given rise to an endless diversity of relations both of attraction and of repulsion. Everywhere, from the very first, the contact of Christianity with Judaism gave birth to varying phases of Judaico-Christian-ism such as afterwards developed into monstrous forms of error. It was no new thing with the apostle that he should find himself called upon to check, on the part of weak or insincere brethren, a tendency to draw towards Judaism at the cost of not merely unseemly but even fundamentally fatal compliances. The peril was always very near, and had to be constantly watched and guarded against.

Here only in the New Testament does it form a syntactical part of a sentence. But in the Septuagint this construction is of repeated occurrence, following the Hebrew construction of <span class="accented">chali'lah</span> with a dative and an infinitive verb with <span class="accented">min.</span> Thus <a href="../../par/genesis/44-7.htm">Genesis 44:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>.; id., 17. So <a href="../../par/joshua/24-16.htm">Joshua 24:16</a>. The pronoun <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span> is strongly emphasized both in this first clause of the verse and in that which follows. The apostle is vividly contrasting his own feeling and behaviour in relation to the cross of Christ with those of the leaders of the circumcision party whom he has been denouncing. They would fain put the cross as far as possible out of sight, not to offend the Jews they were so anxious to conciliate - that "obnoxious object" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-25.htm">1 Corinthians 1:25</a>) itself, as well as the inferences which the apostle taught them to draw from it in relation to the ceremonial law: <span class="accented">their</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, that whereof they would glory, should be in preference the mutilated flesh of their misled Galatian brethren; <span class="accented">his</span> boast, rejoicing, glory, was, and God helping him should ever be, the cross of Christ <span class="accented">-</span> that, and that alone. It quite emasculates the energy of his utterance to paraphrase "the cross" as being "the doctrine of the cross or of Christ's atonement." Rather, it is the cross itself which rivets his admiring view; sneered at by Gentile, abhorred by Jew, but to his eye resplendent with a multiplicity of truths radiating from it to his soul of infinite preciousness. Among those truths, one group, which to us is apt to appear of but small interest, was to the apostle's heart and conscience productive of profoundest relief. In former days he had experienced the burden and the chafing or benumbing effect of the Law, both as a ceremonial institute and as a "letter" of merely imperative command. It was the cross which released him, as from the guilt and servitude  of <span class="accented">sin</span>, so also from all the worry and distress of bondage to ceremonial prescriptions. And this group of truths, as well as those relating to man's reconciliation with God, he felt it to be his mission, even perhaps his own most especial mission, boldly and frankly to proclaim; not only to rejoice in them on his own behalf, but to hold them forth to the view of others, as replete with blessing to all mankind; to glorify and vaunt them. His motive at present in thus vehemently protesting his own rejoicing in the cross of Christ was doubtless to rouse into fresh activity the slumbering sympathy with those feelings which had probably in some degree once animated his Galatian converts. Therefore it is that he writes, "the cross of <span class="accented">our</span> Lord Jesus Christ," instead of "the cross of <span class="accented">my</span> Lord," which it would else have been in this case natural to him to say, as he does in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>, "for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord," and according to the tone of <a href="../../par/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a> of this Epistle. This "our" hints to the Galatians that they have as much reason as he has to glory in the cross as redeeming God's people alike from sin and from the Law. <span class="cmt_word">By whom</span> (or, <span class="accented">whereby</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>]); <span class="accented">through which the world has been crucified unto me</span>, <span class="accented">and I unto the world.</span> The omission of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1ff3;</span>, which is now generally agreed in, adds to the terseness of the sentence. The article is wanting before <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> elsewhere, as <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-19.htm">2 Corinthians 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>. The construing of the passage which takes the relative <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> as reciting "our Lord Jesus Christ," loses sight of the image which is now the one most prominent to the apostle's view: this surely is not Christ himself, but his cross; as in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a> the apostle determines the more general term, "Jesus Christ," by the more specific one, "and him crucified." The reference of the relative is to be determined, here as often elsewhere, not by the mere propinquity of words in the sentence, but by the nearness of objects to the writer's mind at the moment. In language of singular intensity the apostle bespeaks the all-involving transformation which, through the cross of Christ, his own life had undergone. The world, he says, had become to him a thing crucified: not only a <span class="accented">dead</span> thing, ceasing to interest or attract him, but also a <span class="accented">vile</span>, <span class="accented">accursed</span> thing, something he loathed and despised. And conversely, he himself had become a crucified thing unto the world; not only had he ceased to present to the world ought that could interest or attract it, but also become to it a thing scorned and abhorred; as he says <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>, "We have been made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things." The whole context of those words in the Corinthians (vers. 9-13) is here compressed into the single clause, "I have been crucified unto the world." "The world;" the term denotes unregenerate mankind taken in connection with that entire system of habits of life and of feeling in which man, as un-quickened by the Spirit of God, finds his sphere and home. As the apostle is speaking of his own personal experience, we must understand him as referring in particular to all those circumstances of civil, social, and religious being which had once surrounded him, the honoured Jew and Pharisee. These he enumerates at length in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5, 6</a>. To these we might add, though it would, perhaps, have hardly occurred to Paul's own mind to add it, the ordinary possession of worldly comforts and immunity from want and suffering. All, he proceeds in that passage to say, he had "forfeited" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> <a href="../../par/philippians/3-8.htm">Philippians 3:8</a>). Nor did he look back upon his loss with regret: "I do count them as dung (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>)." This twofold description, "I forfeited all things," and "I do count them all as dung," is here summarized in the phrase, "the world is a crucified object to me." The world, further, thus described as crucified to him, included in particular the entire system of Jewish ceremonialism, so far as it existed apart from the vitalizing influence of the Spirit of God. The "natural man (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)" sets great store by religious ceremonialism; it is to him, in fact, his religion. The apostle has himself felt it to be so. But his sentiment now is the very opposite: he accounts it a dead, lifeless thing; nay, even loathsome and abhorred, whenever in the smallest degree placed even by a Christian <span class="accented">Jew</span> in the category of Christianly obedience. That he did regard such religious ceremonialism as belonging to the "world," from which as in Christ he had become dissevered, is plain, both from <a href="../../par/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>, "in bondage under the rudiments of the world," and from <a href="../../par/colossians/2-20.htm">Colossians 2:20</a>, "why, as though living in the world, do ye subject yourself to ordinances, Handle not," etc. That this particular ingredient in the whole system recited as "the world" was at this moment present to the apostle's mind, appears from his singling out circumcision for mention in the next verse. While, however, this was a part of the "crucified world" just now prominent to his view, this term comprised to his consciousness much beside; namely, the entire mass of ungodliness and vice which appertains to "the course, <span class="accented">or</span> age, of this world" (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>), from which <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, the Christian is by the daily transforming of his character to be removed (<a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).  (See above, <a href="../../par/galatians/1-4.htm">Galatians 1:4</a>, and note.) "Through which;" in various ways was the cress of Christ the means of effecting this mutual crucifixion between the apostle and the world. It is apparent, from the whole tenor of his Epistles, that Christ crucified, as manifesting both Christ's love to sinful men in general, and to his own self in particular, "the chief of sinners," and likewise the love of God his Father, wrought with so mighty an attraction upon his whole soul - intellect, conscience, affections - that all other objects which were only not connected with this one lost to him their whole zest and interest, while all other objects which clashed with the moral and spiritual influence of this became absolutely distasteful and repulsive. And, on the other hand, the world at large met the man who was animated with this absorbing devotion to God as manifested in a crucified Christ, with just that estrangedness and aversion which might have been anticipated. The influence exercised by the cross in crucifying the world and the apostle to each other was intensified by the especial bearing which, in the apostle's view, the cross had towards Jewish ceremonialism (see <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/galatians/2-19.htm">Galatians 2:19, 20</a>, and notes). The vivid, intense manner in which the apostle proclaimed such sentiments alienated from him the adherents and champions of Judaism, and made him of all Christians the one who was to them the most obnoxious. And how this affected his standing, even in the Gentile world, there have been above repeated occasions for noting.

The evidence for the rejection of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which is found in all the uncial manuscripts except the Vatican, is by no means equally decisive. The presence of those words in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>, where they are very suitable to the context, has with great probability been supposed to explain their being also found here, being introduced, like <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> from the former passage, by the copyists; but here the qualification made by them is not so certainly required. The apostle felt it to be not merely true <span class="accented">relatively</span>, that is, for those "in Christ Jesus," but, since Christ died on a cross, true <span class="accented">absolutely</span>, that for salvation neither circumcision was aught, nor uncircumcision, but only a new creature. For the discussion of the terms of the aphorism as here stated, as compared with its form in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a> and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>, the reader is referred to the notes on Galatians 5:6. The words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> may mean either "a new creature," or "a new act of creation making a man a new creature." It is hardly admissible to take <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> as "creation" in a collective sense, as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>; though this <span class="accented">may</span>, perhaps, be its meaning in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," that is (perhaps), he finds himself, as it were, in a new heaven and a new earth. Christians as such are elsewhere described by the apostle as the product of God's creative hand; thus in <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, "For we are his workmanship (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), created (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) in Christ Jesus for good works." As "begotten again" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/1-23.htm">1 Peter 1:23</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>), or "born anew" (<a href="../../par/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), subjects of a "regeneration" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>), they must, of course, be the products of a new act of creation. In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14-18</a> the sentence, "If any man is in Christ, there is a new creation," or "he is a new creature," lies embedded in a passage which describes in language of remarkable intenseness the transforming influence of Christ's death, wherever by faith it has been fully grasped. That passage, occurring as it does in an Epistle written nearly at the same time as the Epistle to the Galatians, leaves no doubt as to the ideas which in the apostle's mind cluster round the term" new creation," mentioned, here too as in effect there, in close connection with the cross of Christ, his sole supreme glory. It points to the state of a sinner consciously reconciled to God by the death of Christ, and finding himself thus translated into the midst of new perceptions, new joys, new habits of life. new expectations. "The old things are passed away" - guilt, the overmastering power of sin, laborious effort after goodness frustrated after all and ineffectual, the servile routine of a dead unquickening ceremonialism: "behold, all things are become new, and all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself through Christ." The phrase, "a new creature," appears to have been used by the Jews to describe the change resulting in the case of a heathen becoming a proselyte. <span class="accented">That</span> was no doubt a great change; but far greater seemed to the apostle to be the transformation in the case of one translated from the bondage and darkness of the "letter" into the "newness of the Spirit" (<a href="../../par/romans/7-6.htm">Romans 7:6</a>). lie had himself experienced how marvellously great as well as how blessed the transition was; and he has described it in  glowing terms also in <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-2:10</a>. In the present passage the particle "for" seems to point back, not exclusively to ver. 14, but to the general tenor of the whole passage in vers. 12-14, as rebuking that great ado about circumcision which the innovators referred to were making in the Galatian Churches, thereby diverting the minds of those that listened to them from the Christian's true business. This sense of the particle may seem somewhat loose; but it suits well the rapid, decisive, summarizing strain with which the apostle is now closing up his letter. The supreme concern, he means, for every one who wishes to be a member of God's kingdom is that he shall realize in his own experience the "new creation;" alike in the freedom and joy of adoption which appertains thereto (ch. 4.), and also in that walking of the Spirit which includes the crucifixion of the flesh (<a href="../../par/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16-25</a>). On this point we may compare <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-23.htm">Ephesians 4:23, 21</a> and <a href="../../par/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>.

The future tense appears to point forward to what should be the case among the Galatians when the letter now going to them should have had time to do its work. But what in the preceding context does the apostle refer to as supplying "this rule"? Many think that he points to the aphorism in ver. 15, affirming the utter indifferency of circumcision or uncircumcision, and the all-importance of a "new creature;" in which case the stress would lie mainly upon the latter point, the "new all-importance of a  creature," which was of perpetual interest, rather than on the indiffereney of circumcision which in itself was a matter of but passing concern. It may be fairly questioned, however, whether the apostle does not rather point to the description which in ver. 14 he has given of the manner in which he himself regarded the cross of Christ, as a pattern to the Galatian Churchmen of the manner in which they also should be affected by it. It was customary with the apostle to present himself to his converts as the model to which they should conform themselves. Thus he commends the Thessalonians for that on their conversion they proved themselves imitators of <span class="accented">him</span> (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a>). When discoursing to the Corinthians of his manifold afflictions and of his self-humbling, men-loving demeanour under them all, he besought them to be imitators of <span class="accented">him</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-9.htm">1 Corinthians 4:9-16</a>), which entreaty he renews with a similar reference in 1 Corinthians 9:1. So he exhorts the Philippians to unite with one another in imitating <span class="accented">him</span>, and to fix their regards upon such as walked as they had him and those with him for a pattern (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-17.htm">Philippians 3:17</a>), and again repeats to them (Philippians 4:9), "Those things which ye, moreover, learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, do," - all which clauses refer to his own character and doings as seen by themselves or as reported to them by others (see Alford, in loc.). This purpose, of propounding his sentiments and course of action as a model for the guidance of his converts, no doubt underlies very many of those passages in which he so frankly and (we might but for this be tempted to think) so sell:approvingly dilates upon them. In those days we must remember there was no "Canon "of New Testament Scripture which might serve for the guidance of the newly gained converts from heathenism; for practical guidance in the Christian life, besides the Old Testament Scriptures (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-15.htm">2 Timothy 3:15-17</a>), they had, perforce, to be referred partly to their own moral sense, partly to the inward teachings of the Holy Spirit, and partly, and this to a very important extent, to the living examples of eminently Spirit-taught men. This purpose, of propounding himself as an example, evidently underlay the writing of ver. 14; and it is the consciousness that it was so that now leads him to use the phrase, "by this rule," in reference, as seems most probable, to that very description of his own life. It is noticeable that, after having exhorted the Philippians to do all the things which they had seen and known him to do, he adds (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-9.htm">Philippians 4:9</a>). "And the God of peace shall be with you;" just as he here says, "As many as shall be walking orderly by this rule, peace upon them, and mercy!" We are now brought into a position to see clearly the force of the conjunction "and," with which he introduces this verse. It connects it closely with ver. 14. "I myself glory in the cross of Christ, and to that cross have sacrificed all I held dear; and for all that shall be found walking in that same path - upon them shall rest my hearty sympathy and my pastoral benediction." It is further deserving of notice that in <a href="../../par/philippians/3.htm">Philippians 3</a>, when presenting himself to the Philippians as their examplar, the apostle speaks of "many" - no doubt with inclusive reference to those Judaizing advocates of circumcision whose circumcision  he scornfully styles a <span class="accented">concision -</span> as being "the enemies of the cross of Christ." This was written some years after the Epistle to the Galatians; but it shows that it was a common experience with the apostle to find among the Gentile Churches two classes in particular of Christians: one, consisting of his own adherents and followers in the spirit and life of the gospel; another, of those who (either because as born Jews or Gentile Judaizers, they eschewed the pollution of the cross and its aspect towards the ceremonial <span class="accented">Law</span>, or because they were Gentiles, ashamed before their countrymen of trusting in a Jew who had been crucified), were fain to the utmost of their power to thrust the crucifixion of Christ out of sight - "the enemies of the cross of Christ?" <span class="cmt_word">Peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). The suppletion of "be" in the Authorized Version, in preference to "shall be" or "is," is borne out by the fact that the language of benediction, both in the greeting at the beginning of the Epistles and in their close, ordinarily omits the copula verb, which in such cases must be what is here supplied. We may compare in particular <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>, "Grace <span class="accented">be</span> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in uncorruptness," not only as similar in construction, requiring the like suppletion of "be," but also as another instance in which the apostle pronounces his pastoral benediction with a certain limitation, specifying those only who sincerely love Jesus Christ. The limitation in these two cases only implied is in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-22.htm">1 Corinthians 16:22</a> converted into a distinctly expressed anathema upon those who do not love Christ. The present passage makes the implied limitation without even that measure of stern precision which would have been marked by his writing <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> ("upon these") instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> ("upon them"). It seems as if he would fain <span class="accented">allure</span> back to the gospel blessing those of his readers who might feel themselves as not now coming within its range. Perhaps in the addition of the words, "and mercy," we may detect a sympathizing sense in the mind of the apostle of the mental suffering, which those in Galatia sincerely devoted to the crucified Christ had and would still have to encounter, in contending for the truth of the gospel against fellow Churchmen of their own. They would probably be no mere hard-minded controversialists, but humble, loving believers, to whom the <span class="accented">mercy</span> of God would be very dear. The apostle adds it to his greeting only in writing to Timothy (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-2.htm">1 Timothy 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a>), distinguished apparently for the affectionateness and feminine-heartedness of his character. In <a href="../../par/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a> the addition is not genuine. The words, "and upon the Israel of God," seem to be an echo of the "peace upon Israel (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>)," which, in the Septuagint, closes the hundred and twenty-fifth and hundred and twenty-eighth psalms. The addition of the words, "of God," seems intended pointedly to distinguish the "Israel" which the apostle has m view from that which boasted itself as being Israel while it was not, and also from the false brethren (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, <a href="../../par/galatians/2-4.htm">Galatians 2:4</a>) in the Christian Church, who were for linking themselves with the false Israel. The addition is not merely honorific, as in the expression, "the Church of God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-2.htm">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; 10:32; 11:22; 15:9), but distinctive as well - that which alone God views and loves as "Israel" - to wit, the entire body of real believers in Christ, who, as portrayed in this Epistle, are "children of promise after the fashion of Isaac" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-28.htm">Galatians 4:28</a>), Abraham's seed and heirs of the promise" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>), and the children of "the upper Jerusalem, which is our mother" (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). Of that portion of the true Israel which dwelt in Galatia (see <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>), those who, like the apostle, consecrated themselves to Christ as crucified, were the guiding and characterizing element; and therefore his blessing shed upon these spreads itself also upon those connected with them. That the apostle is even here still regardful of others among the Galatians, who were themselves" shifting away from the gospel" and were drawing others away too (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6, 7</a>), is shown by the next verse.

As being less ambiguous, it is chosen in preference to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, because this latter word is also used in the sense "finally," as in <a href="../../par/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>, as well as for "henceforth," as in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>. The meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> is illustrated by Aristophanes, 'Pax.,' 1050, "You shall never dine henceforth (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) any more in the Prytaneum;" and Herod., 3:15. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">no man trouble me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "cause trouble, or annoyance," occurs also in <a href="../../par/matthew/26-10.htm">Matthew 26:10</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-7.htm">Luke 11:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-5.htm">Luke 18:5</a>. Obviously the apostle refers to such trouble as was now accruing to him from the endeavours of the Judaizing party to pervert his Galatian disciples. On him fell the "anxiety of all the Churches" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-28.htm">2 Corinthians 11:28</a>). In any of his Gentile Churches, the defeat of the work of the gospel by Judaizing perversion was a "worry" which touched him to the very quick. There is nothing to warrant the supposition that he alludes to assaults made in particular upon his apostolical  authority, such as he had often occasion to deal with, <span class="accented">as</span>, for example, at Corinth. None such have been referred to in this Epistle, though he has found occasion to complain of the alienated affections of his converts. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> [Receptus, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">I am one who bear branded on my body the flesh-marks of Jesus.</span> The <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;</span> is inserted with emphasis. Being such as he here describes himself, he had a claim upon his brethren to be spared unnecessary annoyance. The Greek word <span class="accented">stigma</span> here employed denotes a mark on the flesh, either by <span class="accented">puncture</span>, its proper sense, with a hot, sharp instrument, very often with hot needles (see Prudentius's lines quoted by Grotius in his note on the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, mark, in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>), or more summarily by simply branding without puncture. It served sometimes as a mark of permanent ownership, as upon horses or cattle (Liddell and Scott, <span class="accented">sub verb.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>). In respect to slaves, it was not considered humane to brand them, except for punishment, or as security in particular cases against running away. Hence <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, brandling, designated a scoundrel or a runaway slave; as Aristophanes, 'Lys.,' 331; 'Av.,' 760. Others besides slaves were sometimes branded in ignominious punishment: Aristophanes, 'Ran.,' 1507; Herod., 7:233. Thus we have in &AElig;schines (38, 26), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "a branded deserter." Vegetius (quoted by Facciolati, <span class="accented">sub verb. stigma</span>), writing three hundred years later, states ('Do Re Milit.,' 1:8; 2:5) that, in the Roman army, raw recruits had to be proved fit for service before they were allowed to have the tattoo put upon them. After due trial, they were "punc-turis in cute punctis milites scripti et matriculis inserti." But this testimony does not establish the fact of such usage prevailing in the Roman army in St. Paul's time; though it is quite supposable that then, as now, soldiers might sometimes tattoo on their arm or hand the name of a favourite general. Instances are cited of consecration to a particular god being signalized by <span class="accented">stigma.</span> Herodotus, writing five hundred years before, says of a certain temple of Heracles, on the Egyptian coast, that if a servant, belonging to any man whatever, took sanctuary in it, and put upon himself sacred <span class="accented">stigmata</span>, giving himself to the god, no one could touch him (2:113). In 3Macc. 2:29 mention is made of a "mark of Dionysus" ivy leaf being, by means of fire, put upon the body of Jews in Egypt in the time of Ptolemy Philopator; but this would seem to have been intended rather as a barbarous indignity, because especially abhorrent to their religious feelings, than as an actual consecration of them to Dionysus as his "<span class="accented">slaves."</span> But that it was in some cases employed to signalize a "sacred slave" is attested by Philo, 'De Mon.,' 2. p. 221, M; and Lucian, 'De Dea Syr.,' &sect; 59, as cited by Bishop Lightfoot, who remarks that "<span class="accented">such</span> a practice could not have been unknown in a country which was the home of the worship of Cybele." An example more familiar to the apostle's mind might, perhaps, be cited from <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a> (Septuagint), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span>, "shall write upon his hand, I am God's," which rendering Gesenius ('Thes.,' in <span class="accented">verb. kathabh</span>) consents to accept. But if this rendering be the right one, it may yet be doubted whether it means writing by puncture; for <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> appear in <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> to be forbidden; unless, indeed, the prohibition be taken to refer to idolatrous tattoos only. But even thus the use of such in idol-worships has a further confirmation. It appears, however, to be a strong objection to our supposing the apostle to be here alluding to either the <span class="accented">stigmata</span> of consecration or those of other ownership, that such would infer no more <span class="accented">suffering</span> than would attend simple tattooing; whereas it is plain that the apostle alludes to marks which evidenced the undergoing of inflictions of extraordinary severity. The word <span class="accented">stigma</span> had passed into Roman usage, being employed both in a literal sense and also in a figurative one of a "stigma," as we also speak, cast upon a person's character as by a poet's lampoon. Thus Martial ('Epigr.,' 12:62) writes, "Frons haec stigmate non meo notanda," "This forehead to be marked with a stigma not of my affixing," where the word <span class="accented">frons</span> indicates a close adherence to the original notion of a slave's forehead branded. Suetonius ('Caes.,' 73), "Catullum, a quo sibi versiculis de Mamurra perpetua stigmata imposita non dissimulaverat, satisfacientem eodem die adhibnit coenae." Reviewing the evidence now adduced as to the manner in which the term was used, we observe that the words "brandling" and "branded" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) were used to describe a person made infamous to open view by brand-marks put upon his person. It was natural that the word <span class="accented">stigma</span> would thus acquire the sense of a mark of patent infamy left upon a man's person by some corporal abuse which he had been subjected to, without any other qualifying idea. Now, it appears most probable that it is in this sense that the apostle here uses the word. The term points to those scars, seams, perhaps long-continuing sores, which the long course of ever-recurring hardships and ill usage, through which he had passed,  must have left upon him - patent evidence to all who looked upon him of the manner in which his fellow-men regarded and treated him; this only, apart from any qualifying idea, whether of ownership, or of military allegiance, or of religious consecration. It is in this general sense that Chrysostom appears to have read the clause; and this general sense satisfies all the requirements of the context. A strong light is thrown upon this matter by what the apostle, near about this same time, wrote to the Corinthians, in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/11-22.htm">2 Corinthians 11:22-27</a>. The passage, as indeed does the whole Epistle, with much also of the frmer Epistle addressed to the same Church, betokens a strong feeling at this particular time resting on his mind, of the grievous, countless, hardships which marked his career - a feeling, very supposably, just then freshened by some very painful experiences recently gone through, from the effects of which his bodily form was still suffering. "In stripes above measure,...  in deaths oft. Of the Jews, five times received I forty stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep." Such are some particulars which he specifies; and the enumeration is very suggestive with reference to our present point. Could he have undergone that "stoning" at Lystra, after which he was dragged out of the city as dead to be left to lie without burial, and have carried away no enduring disfigurement? Whether any marks would be likely to remain upon him from the five Jewish whippings, we cannot tell; but we may be assured that the three floggings inflicted with the cruel <span class="accented">vitis</span> of the Roman soldiery must have scarred his flesh with seams of permanent disfigurement. Perhaps while he wrote, sores remaining from some one of those eight punishments were making themselves painfully felt. These judicial inflictions, however, severe as some of them may have been, were nevertheless regulated by law and custom. There were m all probability other, much more barbarous and altogether unregulated, violences, which came often upon him from the brutality of mobs, from the assaults of "robbers," from accidents in shipwreck. It could not fail but that his person presented, wherever he went, conspicuously to view, tokens that he was one wont to be both regarded and dealt with as if he were, no doubt deservedly, a wretched outcast; in his own forcible, most deeply pathetic phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> "as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-13.htm">1 Corinthians 4:13</a>). The apostle's enemies taunted him with the contrast which subsisted between the solemnity and power - would-be power they meant - of his letters, and the meanness and feebleness of his personal appearance and his personal address (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/10-1.htm">2 Corinthians 10:1, 10</a>). His personal presence may, originally and by natural make, not have been calculated to bespeak respect. But whatever disadvantages he lay under originally, must, beyond all question, have been vastly aggravated by the bodily hard ships to which he had been subjected. These must have left effects (this, perhaps, being the "stake in the flesh" which be groaned under - "Satan's messenger to buffet him," the fruits, certainly, of Satan's working in the hearts of godless men) which he felt to be not only fraught with personal humiliation in whatever intercourse he held with his fellow-men, but also likely greatly to mar his efficiency in his ministerial work. The only consolation remaining to him was that, in the utter extinction of all self-love, he rejoiced to know that Christ's grace had, in this enhanced feebleness of his instrument, the clearer field wherein to manifest its own Divine potency (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>). "The flesh-marks of Jesus." This may be understood as meaning that they were incurred in Jesus' service. In part it may be so taken; but the relation expressed by this genitive appears to go deeper than that. The apostle means, the marks which disfigured the body of Jesus as now reproduced in <span class="accented">his</span> body. The genitive is used in just the same way as it is in the strikingly similar clause in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>, "always bearing about in the body the dying of Jesus (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>), where ' <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> means apparently "the deadness <span class="accented">or</span> corpse-condition of Jesus" (compare the use of the Greek noun in <a href="../../par/romans/4-19.htm">Romans 4:19</a>); the state of Jesus' <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, while yet hanging a corpse on the cross. By s strong hyperbole, prompted by the intense feeling then on his mind of his own bodily sufferings and the almost ever-present imminency of death (comp. vers. 7-12 of the same chapter), the apostle, in those words, refers to "Jesus' corpse-condition" as reproduced in his own bodily condition, adding the expression of his assured conviction that all was to this end - that "the life also of Jesus," that is, the life which Jesus himself lives, should be all the more clearly manifested by what he was working in the world, in and through a body apparently so death-bound as the apostle's was. The use of the phrase, thus interpreted, coheres well with the feeling which, in the writing of this Epistle, was very near to his soul, of his being "crucified along with Christ." The phrase, then, glances at those swollen, livid, blood-flecked, wales and bruises (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>:) which the  Roman scourging that immediately preceded his being handed over for crucifixion must have left on his sacred flesh - no part spared - the entire frame pervaded alike with disfigurement and with torture. To the body of his adorable Lord at that hour - to the human consciousness of every thoughtful spectator, defaced, shorn by the dis-honouring whip of the dignity properly connate with a human body, and made utterly vile (for this should seem to have been the symbolical meaning and intent of that customary preliminary of crucifixion) - and, at length on the cross, presenting to open view those brand-marks of degradedness, the apostle feels his own body to be, in the treatment it had received and the condition to which it had been reduced, in no small measure assimilated. Not only was he in spirit joined unto his Lord and one spirit with him; but in body likewise was he (so to speak) joined unto his Lord, and one body with him; being deeply "taught" in the lesson of what was meant by being "a sharer of his sufferings, while day by day becoming more conformed to the fashion of <span class="accented">his</span> death" (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>); clothed with Christ in this sense also; clothed with the Crucified One. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, as here introduced, may be distinguished from the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>, by presenting the notion of one's carrying something in thought separable from one's self, instead of being (so to speak) commingled with one's own being. "<span class="accented">I</span> am carrying, and can offer to your view, the brand-marks of Jesus." Chrysostom catches this view, perhaps carrying it out somewhat far, in his animated comment, "He saith not, 'I have,' but  I carry;' like a man priding himself on a trophy and ensigns of a king." The use of the same verb in <a href="../../par/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a>, "to bear my Name before the Gentiles and kings," clearly illustrates its import here. This closing verse is withal no piteous appeal for commiserating sympathy. The tone of "from henceforth," betokening the feeling of one who has made up his mind not to be trifled with, precludes the notion of his mood being one of mere self-pity and tenderness. Far more does the apostle hereby make claim to share with his Lord in that mingled sentiment of reverence and deferential, sympathetic compliance, which the disciple of Christ might be expected to entertain towards his Lord, crucified for him; such a sentiment as would prompt him to lighten, if he might, <span class="accented">his</span> burden and pain, to take part in <span class="accented">his</span> enterprise, to help forward <span class="accented">his</span> designs. Those brand-marks would cry out in loud protest against a <span class="accented">fellow-disciple's</span> antipathy, tergiversation, or disesteem.

The pre-eatery imperative "be," which, of course, is to be supplied, clothes a friendly wish in the pious form of a prayer. "With," the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> which, in the Septuagint, represents the Hebrew '<span class="accented">im</span>, meaning "present to help," is illustrated by <a href="../../par/genesis/21-22.htm">Genesis 21:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ruth/2-4.htm">Ruth 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; 28:90; <a href="../../par/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/john/16-32.htm">John 16:32</a>.

It expresses his desire that Christ's grace might be <span class="accented">very</span> near to them - near to the most intimate and most controlling part of their nature. The singular "spirit" is conjoined with the plural pronoun "your," as in <a href="../../par/romans/8-16.htm">Romans 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a> ("your body"); <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>, "your spirit and soul and body."

The final "Amen" seals the true earnestness and the devotional spirit of the benediction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../galatians/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Galatians 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Galatians 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ephesians/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ephesians 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ephesians 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
