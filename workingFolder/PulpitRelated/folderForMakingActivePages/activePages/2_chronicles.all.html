To his son Abijah, by his favourite wife Maachah, who was the third of the wives that belonged to the house of Jesse, he bequeathed the kingdom. Wanting any positive Scripture statement of the matter of Rehoboam going to Shechem, we believe the explanation given above is the most probable, and that it was not any designed stroke of policy, with the view of conciliating or flattering Ephraim. Though no formal statement of it be made here, yet it is quite intelligible that the opinions, feelings, and readiness to express them on the part of Ephraim and "Israel" were well enough known, and had to be reckoned for. Shechem. For many reasons one of the most interesting geographical names in all the Old Testament. It was the ancient capital, as Shiloh, near to it, was the ancient seat of the national worship. It was situate in Ephraim, with Ebal to the immediate north, and Gerizim to the immediate south. Its upper slopelands (its position on which is possibly the origin of the name, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>, "a shoulder" commanded a view of the Mediterranean. It was the half-way resting-place, at the end of the second day's journey, for travellers from Galilee to Jerusalem, and hence bore the name in later times, it is thought, of Mabertha, or Mabartha (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>), Pliny's Mamortha.

The Authorized Version synonyms of Shechem appear as <span class="accented">Sichem</span>, <span class="accented">Sychem, Sychar</span> (<a href="../../par/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5, 20</a>).

The article "Shechem," by Dr. Hackett, in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. pp. 1234-1240, is of exceptional interest. All Israel. No doubt this expression may mean even here the assemblage of the federated twelve tribes. Considering the immediate recurrence of the expression in ver. 3, it must be, however, that the Jeroboam party of the ten tribes (headed by the strong and self-conscious Ephraimites) are especially in view; in point of fact, of course, all the twelve tribes were represented in the gathering of ver. 1. There can be no division of opinion about this, though the meeting be represented as one demanded or occasioned by the attitude of Israel, in the lesser comprehension of the name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-2.htm">2 Chronicles 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who <i>was</i> in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard <i>it</i>, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - In these verses the compiler brings up lost time. He has not mentioned before the name of Jeroboam, just as he has not mentioned the lustful sins of Solomon that led to idolatry, and these sequel idolatries of his, that heralded the shattering of his kingdom immediately on his decease. So we are now told all in one how Jeroboam, in his refuge-retreat in Egypt (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>), "heard" of Solomon's demise, and apparently (see first clause of our third verse) heard of it in this wise, that "they," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "all Israel" (of our first verse) "had sent and called him" Probably the growing sense of discontent and the rankling in those tribes that were not closely breathing the atmosphere of Jerusalem and the one home county, because of their burdens and taxation, and possibly also Ephraim's ancient and famed rivalry, knew instinctively that this hour of Solomon's death was the hour, if any, of their redemption. The <span class="accented">lacunae</span> in the history speak for themselves; for though the tribes, after the long seething of their com-plainings and sufferings, needed but short time for deliberation, Solomon's death must have been an accomplished fact before they (whoever the "they" were) sent to Egypt to Jeroboam; and that sending and his returning or otherwise, at any rate his hearing and consequent returning, must have taken time. Considering all this, it <span class="accented">is re</span>markable that no note of time is found. But had only our first verse been placed as the last of the foregoing chapter, the ambiguity would have been less. For the strange variations on the history of Jeroboam (a name, together with that of Rehoboam, new to Solomon's time, meaning "many-peopled," while Rehoboam signifies "increaser of people"), as found in the Hebrew texts, and additions to it, see the Septuagint Version, <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-43.htm">1 Kings 11:43</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; and A. P. Stanley's article, "Jeroboam," in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. 979, 980; and comp. again <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-26.htm">1 Kings 11:26-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-13.htm">1 Kings 14:13, 17, 18</a>. Stanley's faith in the Septuagint notwithstanding, its variations and additions are not reconcileable enough with either the Hebrew text or themselves to command anything like unfeigned acceptance. One thing may be considered to come out without much obscurity or uncertainty - that Jeroboam was the acknowledged rather than tacit leader of an opposition that was tacit at present rather than acknowledged; nor is it at all improbable, under all the circumstances, that the Rehoboam party <span class="accented">in</span>, knowing well how the ground really lay, were as content to let the coronation, so to call it, at Shechem linger awhile for Jeroboam's return, as Jeroboam's opposition party <span class="accented">out</span> desired and perhaps compelled the delay. Of course, Jeroboam knew well, none better than he, as of old the overseer of the forced labour and taxation of Ephraim (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), how grievous the service and how heavy the yoke to his people, even when he had acquitted himself as the most "industrious" of taskmasters.

These may, for conciseness' sake, be supposed to correspond with the naturally enough hated "forced labour" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27, 28</a>) and the burdensome "taxes" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-19.htm">1 Kings 4:19-28</a>) which had not failed to become more odious to the people as familiarity with them grew. The refreshing New Testament contrast to all this (<a href="../../par/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>) will occur to every memory. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-5.htm">2 Chronicles 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - This first reply of Rehoboam was not necessarily inauspicious. Yet sometimes, as it proved now, the caution that takes time to consider heralds fatal mistake. This is when either a generous, instinctive impulse, asking an instantaneous obedience, is chilled by some self-regard; or yet worse, when the offended Spirit is restrained, and no inner guiding voice is heard, as Saul found, to his ruin. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-6.htm">2 Chronicles 10:6</a></div><div class="verse">And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye <i>me</i> to return answer to this people?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived.</span> The first practical step now taken by Rehoboam, if he delay at all, is the right and far from inauspicious step. <span class="accented">O si sic omnia</span> that followed after! The "old men" here spoken of, and not before distinctly spoken of, need not necessarily be regarded as professional advisers of Solomon, nor as a privy council of slate; they may designate those of like age with him, or but little his juniors, and with whom he had chiefly associated for his own society. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-7.htm">2 Chronicles 10:7</a></div><div class="verse">And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - Rehoboam was now (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>; but cf. 13:7) forty-one years of age; he was just too old to find any excuse for inability to gauge either the experience, and value of it, of the "old," or the inexperience, and foolishness of it, of the immature human heart. According to the modern phrase, he was just ripe to have known and bethought himself of this. But all rashly Rehoboam casts the die. The sound judgment, real knowledge, opportune and practical advice of the "old men," uttered evidently off so kind a tongue, should have been indeed now "as good as an inheritance; yea, better too" (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/7-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:11</a>, margin). The reading of the parallel is well worthy to be noted (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>), with its manifestly pleasantly and skilfully worded antithesis, "If <span class="accented">thou this day</span> will be a servant to this people...  then <span class="accented">they</span> will be thy servants <span class="accented">for ever."</span> Our words, however, have their own exquisite beauty about them, <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt be kind to this</span> <span class="cmt_word">people, and please them, and speak good words to them.</span> One might fancy that Saul, and David, and Solomon, and angels themselves bended over the scene, and looked and listened and longed for wisdom and love and right to prevail. <span class="cmt_word">The young men that had grown up with him</span>. While this expression throws light as above on that which speaks of Rehoboam's <span class="cmt_word">old men</span> counsellors, it wakens the question how men of forty-one years of age can be called "young," as Rehoboam was not living in patriarchal aged times. And the question is emphasized by the language applied to Rehoboam in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, where he is described as "young and tenderhearted," and unable, for want of strength of character and of knowledge, to "withstand vain men" (as he surely shows too clearly now). It has been suggested ('Speaker's Commentary,' 2:562, Note C) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span> (21) should be read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span> (41) in the two passages quoted above (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>). The suggestion seems good, and it is certainly reasonable for the requirements of both matter and manner.

The Divine word foretold, as the Divine mind foreknew, the inevitable course of the stream, that took its source in and from Solomon's faithless heart and life. Solomon "being dead yet" bears his full share of the responsibility of what Rehoboam was, and shortly came to <span class="accented">show</span> he was. Everything must fall out as God foretells it shall fall out, not because "the cause is from him" in <span class="accented">this</span> sense that he has made it, but in the sense that he has pronounced it, through knowing it with an absolute knowledge. It were but a thing to be expected also, that just in the measure that the Bible is the Word of God, it shall exhibit and pronounce plainly the phenomena of his own ultimate fiats, rather than linger to track or describe the uncertainties of human morality or conduct. Let but that <span class="accented">result</span> appear, which God has with his sure and abiding Word declared, and the practical attitude and language of Scripture are that it is vain to fight against it; for the thing is of God. It was known of him and said of him. And it carries its punishment or its recompense in it, as of him. It will be noticed, again, how our compiler refers to the incident of Ahijah, as though he had recorded it, which he had not done.

God said that this tribe and (as is abundantly evident from Ahijah's forcibly dramatic parable of the rent garment) Benjamin also should be saved to Rehoboam and for ever to David's line, and again it is evident that he works in the midst of human event, and moral cause and effect.

The tribe of Benjamin lay hemmed in between Ephraim, to which it had once much leaned, and to which (as Benjamin was the blood-uncle of Ephraim) it was more closely related, and Judah, with which it had once been at variance (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-32</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>).

It is first found in the added part of Deuteronomy (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>), where it is applied to Moses.

To him Jeroboam had fled for refuge from Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>). He reigned An. Sac. 3830 ( <span class="date">B.C. 980</span>) to 3851 or 3863. This makes Solomon's reign A.S. 3799 ( <span class="date">B.C. 1011</span>) to 3839 ( <span class="date">B.C. 971</span>). Shishak's invasion, therefore, in aid of Jeroboam, was A.S. 3844 ( <span class="date">B.C. 966</span>). A representation of it exists in relief sculptured on the south external wall of the temple of Amen, at Karnak, Thebes; and, together with this, an elaborate list of countries, cities, tribes, conquered by Sheshenk or tributary to him, a hundred and thirty-three in number. Among these are some of the very fifteen fenced cities (see our ver. 4) which Rehoboam built or fortified, viz. the three, Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon, while the erasure of fourteen names just where these are found accounts, no doubt, for the non-appearance of others of them. There are also the names of Levitical and Canaanite cities, situated in the kingdoms of the ten tribes, but belonging to the Levites who had been compelled to migrate into Judah. The dates given above are those accepted by Conder, in his 'Handbook to the Bible' (see pp. 28-34), and do not quite agree with those adopted in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1287-1294. Both of these most interesting articles will well repay perusal, as well as the article "Thebes" in the latter work, 3:1471-1475. (The name and word <span class="accented">Shishak</span> has no relation whatever with the <span class="accented">Sheshach</span> of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>; It. 41, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, a word which, possibly spelling <span class="accented">Babel</span> or even <span class="accented">Ur</span>, marks the name of a place, and is evidently used by Jeremiah for Babylon or Babylonia.)

Possibly, considering the words of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5-12, 17</a>, this may indicate that Rehoboam was brought down to thinking almost more of the safety of Jerusalem and himself than of the kingdom in its length and breadth. <span class="cmt_word">One and forty years old</span> (see our note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>, towards the end, and compare our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a>, as well as the parallel places, <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-8.htm">1 Kings 12:8</a> and 1 Kings 14:21).

Rehoboam's mother's name and nationality are noted also, and twice in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21, 31</a>). Naamah was possibly the daughter of Nahash (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-1.htm">1 Chronicles 19:1-20:3</a>). The briefness but decidedness of the notifications made as to this mother of Rehoboam leaves us without doubt that there is not lacking significance in them. Schulz (in his ' Scholia in Ver. Test.,' vol. 3.) says the reason is "quia ca filio idololatriae ansam dedisse videtur;" Keil and Bertheau think that, though there was evidence of this in the case of the mention of Asa's mother (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), the explanation here is that Naamah "appears" to have had, as queen-mother, considerable influence in the government. They do not specify where they find this to "appear" with any marked plainness. It is quite true that, in the successive accounts of the Jewish kings, the name of each mother is mentioned (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-32.htm">2 Chronicles 20:32</a>, etc.). We should say it is like the book, so Divine and human, called the Bible, to do so far-seeing and far-reaching a thing as to give the mother's name; and practically to say that Solomon and Naamah were (in special sense for Judah) a repetition of Adam and Eve. How far Judah and her line of kings may have correctly said, <span class="accented">they</span> were answerable for "death and all our woe," the sacred historians say (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4, 9-11, 14, 23, 26, 31, 33, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-24.htm">1 Kings 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-4.htm">2 Chronicles 11:4</a>).

The authorities quoted here are the works of Shemaiah and of Iddo, and it is possible that the following words touching the continual wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, which have not the substantive verb among them, may have been part of the title of Iddo's work, although it is more probable that his work on 'Genealogies' would retain the character of a specialty. We subjoin for English readers a literal translation of this verse: "And the words (acts) of Jeroboam first and last, are they not written in the words (acts) of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer touching genealogies" [but Gesenius, <span class="accented">sub voce</span>," in the manner of a genealogical table"] "and wars of Rehoboam and Jeroboam perpetual."

As in our note (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-20.htm">2 Chronicles 11:20</a>), the word "daughter," as in many similar cases, stands for granddaughter. Thus the father of Maachah was Uriel of Gibeah, and her mother Tamar, daughter of Absalom. Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:10. &sect; 1) proffers us this connecting link of explanation. On the other hand, Rabbi Joseph's Targum on Chronicles says that Uriel means Absalom, but was a name used to avoid the use of Absalom.

The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;</span>) signifies a hill with round top, and hence would easily give name to many places.

"The covenant of salt" meant the imperish-ableness and irrevocableness of the engagement made between the two parties to the covenant The widespread and deeply significant use of it among other and heathen nations is remarkable indeed, and is attested by Pliny ('Hist.

It is true that some of the ancient indications and descriptions of friendship and close friendships turned on phrases (similar ones, indeed, still existing) into which the word "salt" entered, but that these phrases arose from the fact that salt was so general a constituent of human food seems insufficient explanation, where we can find one of a more direct and more directly religious, or, as the case might be (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> with heathen sacrifices), superstitious birth. Religion and superstition between them have been the most world-wide, incalculable, and untraceable originators and disseminators of half the possible phrases of human language!

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-7.htm">2 Chronicles 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are gathered...  have strengthened themselves</span>. The aorist tense is needed for the rendering in both these cases; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "And vain men gathered to him, and strengthened themselves against him." <span class="cmt_word">Vain men</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. This word, and one very slightly different in form, and their adverb, occur in all forty-one times; rendered in the Authorized Version "empty" nineteen times, "vain" eighteen times, and "without cause," "to no purpose," and "void" the remaining four times. It is the word that is used of the "empty" pit of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-24.htm">Genesis 37:24</a>); of the "empty ears" of corn (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>); of "empty" pitchers and other vessels (<a href="../../par/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-3.htm">Jeremiah 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-34.htm">Jeremiah 51:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>). And in all the other cases expresses metaphorically the emptiness of head, of heart, or of reason, with the same simple force of language appropriate, it appears, then as now. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Belial</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>. This word is found twenty-seven times, and, including seven marginal options, is rendered in the Authorized Version "Belial" twenty-three times; the four exceptions being "wicked" three times, and "naughty" once. The derivation of it marks the one expressive meaning of "without profit." <span class="cmt_word">Young and tender-hearted</span>. Hard as it is to put these objections to the credit of a man forty-one years of age (see our note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/10-8.htm">2 Chronicles 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>) at all, yet, if so, they can only be explained as some do explain them, of a blamable ignorance, inexperience, and instability.

Of course, Jeroboam felt his own position in the matter so weak, that each false, illegitimate candidate for the priestly service must bring his sacrifice, and that a larger one by five rams than the divinely ordered one of Moses.

It is against that suggestion that there is no sign of this, by word or deed, in what is here said of the beginning of Asa's reign; the signs are to the contrary, especially taking into the question the indications given us respecting the tendencies, if not contradicted, of the queen-mother Maachah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>), and it is not supposable that a boy of twelve years of age could contradict them. This point must be held still moot. <span class="cmt_word">In his days...  quiet ten years</span>. No doubt one cause of this was the defeat that Jeroboam and Israel had sustained at the hands of Abijah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-18.htm">2 Chronicles 13:18-20</a>). It appears also, from <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-19.htm">1 Kings 15:19</a>, that after that defeat a league was instituted between Abijah and the then King of Syria: "There is a league between me and thee, and between <span class="accented">my father and thy father."</span> And these things, with Israel's new kings, and <span class="accented">perhaps</span> Asa's extreme youth, would have favoured the repose of the land.

On the question of this apparent inconsistency and surface-contradiction, see our Introduction, &sect;7, pp. 16:1 and 17:2. Further, it may here be well distinctly to note how little is even the apparent discrepancy or contradiction alleged in this subject, throwing in the analogous passages in Jehoshaphat's history (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>), in case these may reflect any light on the question. Firstly, we will remove out of our way the parallel in <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>, with the observation that it is evident from its immediate context that it corresponds with the last statement of our Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>), savouring of a <span class="accented">retrospective</span> summarizing of the compiler, not with the first statements (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3, 5</a>), which set forth Asa's prospective purpose of heart, his resolution, and, no doubt, his edicts. Secondly, we may notice that there is a plain-enough distinction made by the writer in vers. 3 and 5 respectively - the one saying that Asa "took away the high places," without any further limitation; the other saying within two verses, "Also out of all the cities of Judah" (note by the way here the suggestive stress laid upon "the <span class="accented">cities</span>," possibly as more easily coped with than country districts) "he took away the high places." The only legitimate inference (taking into account both the words used, and the fact that the last written are found <span class="accented">close upon</span> the former, with the significant conjunction "also") must be that some different information was intended in the two places. Ver. 3 finds Asa as much master of "Judah" as ver. 5. Therefore the natural interpretation of ver. 3 must be that Asa at once abolished "the high places" nearest home, nearest Jerusalem, most within his own personal reach; then "<span class="accented">also"</span> that he did and ordered the same to be done in "all the cities of Judah," and it was done at the time, if only for the time. Thirdly, include the statement of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, if we do not insist (as we might insist very fairly when pressed on a point of alleged inconsistency or contradiction) on the fact that now the high places "of Israel" arc distinctly designated, and that therein those <span class="accented">outlying</span> parts of Asa's more or less acknowledged sway <span class="accented">outside of Judah</span> and his thoroughest control are designedly described, let us instead take the help of an exactly analogous (and analogously alleged) discrepancy (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-7.htm">2 Chronicles 17:7</a> compared with <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>), and we find there that the very key with which to unlock the difficulty is provided to our hand. Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-6.htm">2 Chronicles 17:6</a>) "took away the high places;" "the people" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-33.htm">2 Chronicles 20:33</a>) did not faithfully and with a constant heart follow suit, but had failed to prepare, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to turn "their hearts unto the God of their fathers." How well the juxtaposition of these very words would tell, nay, do tell, with the emphatic words of <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>! "Nevertheless <span class="accented">Asa's</span> heart was perfect with the Lord <span class="accented">all his</span> days;" and with our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-17.htm">2 Chronicles 15:17</a>, "Nevertheless the heart of <span class="accented">Asa</span> was perfect <span class="accented">all</span> his days." In both these passages the antithesis is patent between Asa's heart and the <span class="accented">people's</span> hearts, between Asa's "<span class="accented">all</span> his days" and the people's uncertainty and apostasy. The  fidelity of Bible history and its non-cunningly, non-fabulously devised tenor  are gratefully corroborated by the inquisition made into such a supposed "discrepancy," inconsistency," "contradiction." Notice once more the confirming indication, so far as it goes, of the one verb that commands the next verse, as there noted upon. <span class="cmt_word">Brake down the images</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. It occurs in the Authorized Version thirty-two times, and is rendered "pillar" or "pillars" twelve times; "image" or "images" nineteen times; and "garrisons" once. It appears simply to have slipped from the signification of <span class="accented">pillar</span> into the rendering of the word "image," by aid of the intermediate word "statue." It is used of the pillar or statue of Baal in <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26, 27</a>, with his name expressed; and in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-4.htm">2 Chronicles 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-14.htm">2 Chronicles 23:14</a>, without that name expressed. Cut down the groves; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The verb here used implies the "cutting," "cutting down," "pruning" of trees. It is undoubtedly applied also to other cutting and cutting down, as of the "breaking" of a red (<a href="../../par/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>), of an arm (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31</a>), of horns (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-25.htm">Jeremiah 48:25</a>), of bars or bolts (<a href="../../par/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>). It occurs in all twenty-three times. It is here employed to describe the destroying of what according to the Authorized Version arc called "groves" (Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">lucus</span>) <span class="accented">- a</span> word which with little doubt misleads for the rendering of our <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Before this same word we have also another Hebrew verb for "cutting," of very frequent occurrence in its simple and metaphorically derived uses included, viz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>. The first uses of this verb with the above word are found in <a href="../../par/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26, 30</a>. That word means literally "fortune," but in its ultimate derivation "straightness," and hence supposed to designate, in Phoenician and Aramaean idolatry, Astarte or the planet Venus, who is constantly associated in such idolatry with Baal (<a href="../../par/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). But see for the first occurrence of the word, <a href="../../par/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, where there is no express mention of Baal, but where the idolatries of the Amorite, Canaanite, Hittite, Hivite, Perizzite, and Jebusite are being spoken cf. When we take into consideration the probable ultimate derivation of the word, the fact of the verbs that speak of "cutting" being uniformly applied to what it represents, the "burning" to which this was condemned (<a href="../../par/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>) when cut down, and a series of statements that represent it as "set up <span class="accented">under every</span> green tree" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-7.htm">2 Kings 21:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>), it not only becomes perfectly certain that "grove" and "groves" cannot rightly render the word, but directs us with the light of those passages that speak of it coupled with Baal as an object of worship, and that speak of prophet and priest called by its name (<a href="../../par/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a> (compared with Judges 2:13; 10:6; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>); <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>), to the strong conviction that it should be at once written with a capital letter, and rendered as a proper name; that it may possibly be a synonym with Ashtoreth, 1.<span class="accented">q.</span> Astarte, or a representation in wooden pillar, stock or trunk fashion, of some supposed aspect of her passion or dominion, very likely in the voluptuous or sensual direction (see the nevertheless very doubtful Septuagint and Vulgate, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-16.htm">2 Chronicles 15:16</a>; and Vulgate, <a href="../../par/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). Conder, in 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 187, 2nd edit., speaks of "Baal-peor (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>) as identified by St. Jerome with the classical Priapus;" and adds "the <span class="accented">Asherah</span> (rendered 'grove' in our version) was also apparently a similar emblem" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7</a>). The analogy of the sacred tree of the Assyrians sculptured on the monuments of Nineveh ('Nineveh and Persepolis,' p. 299, Fergusson), which was probably a straight trunk or stock garlanded at certain times with ribbons and flowers, has been opportunely pointed to (see also Professor Dr. Murphy's 'Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 115).

This, however, is the rendering adopted by not a few modern commentators (so <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-4.htm">2 Chronicles 34:4</a>). Gesenius would render "the Sun-Bard," or "the Sun-Lord," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> statues of the sun, representing a deity to whom (see ' Phoen. Inseript.') votive stones,were inscribed. In his 'Thesaurus' (p. 489) Gesenius instances the Phoenician inscriptions, as showing that <span class="accented">our chemmanim</span> denoted statues of both Baal, the sun-god, and Astarte, the moon-goddess.

In its vaguest dimensions Ethiopia, or Cush, designated Africa south of Egypt, but more concisely it meant the lands we now call Nubia, Sennaar, Kordefan, and part of Abyssinia. And these, roughly speaking, were bounded north, south, east, and west respectively by Egypt and Syene, Abyssinia, Red Sea, and Libyan Desert. When, however, Ethiopia proper is spoken of, the name probably designates the kingdom of Meroe (<span class="accented">Seba</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); and the Assyrian inscriptions make the Cushite name of the deified Nimrod <span class="accented">one with</span> Meroe), which was so closely associated at different times with Egypt, that sometimes an Egypt king swayed it (as e.g. some eighteen hundred years before <span class="accented">Shishak</span>, Sesostris fourth king of the twelfth dynasty), and sometimes <span class="accented">vice versa</span> (as e.g. the three Ethiopian kings of the twenty-fifth dynasty - Shabak (<span class="accented">Sabakhou</span>), Sethos (<span class="accented">Sebechos</span>), and Tarkos (<span class="accented">Tirhakah</span>), whose reigning dates as between Ethiopia and Egypt are not yet certified). The name thus confined covers an irregular circular bulk of country between "the modern Khartoum, where the <span class="accented">Astapus</span> joins the true Nile, and the influx of the <span class="accented">Astaboras</span>, into their united stream." From the language of Diodorus (1:23), harmonized conjecturally with Strabo (18:821), the region may be counted as 375 miles in circumference and 125 miles in the diameter of the erratic circle, its extreme south point being variously stated, distant from Syene, 873 miles (Pliny, 6:29. &sect; 33); or, according to Mannert's book ('Geogr. d. Alt.,' 10:183), 600 miles by the assertion of Artemidorns, or 625 by that of Eratosthenes. Thence the "Cushite" extended probably to the Euphrates and the Tigris, and through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia. Some, however, think that the Cushite now intended was the Ethiopian of <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, who had settlement near Gerar (Dr. Jamieson, in 'Comm.') as a nomadic horde. Dr. Jamieson quotes Bruce's 'Travels' to support this view, which seems a most improbable, not to say impossible, one nevertheless. The question as to the people intended will perhaps best be found in the solution of the question for whom the name of their king stands (see following note). Zerah. Hebrew as above. It is noteworthy that the four previous occurrences of this name - <a href="../../par/genesis/36-13.htm">Genesis 36:13</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-37.htm">1 Chronicles 1:37</a>, son of Reuel, grandson of Esau; <a href="../../par/genesis/38-30.htm">Genesis 38:30</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>, son of Judah and Tumor; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-24.htm">1 Chronicles 4:24</a>, son of Simeon; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-6.htm">1 Chronicles 5:6, 26</a>, Hebrew text, son of Iddo, a Gershonite Levite - show it as the name of an Israelite, or descendant of Shem. Our present <span class="accented">Zerah</span> is a <span class="accented">Cushite</span>, or descendant of Ham. The Septuagint forms of the name are <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f73;&#x20;&#x396;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, or (Alexandrian) <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Although Professor Dr. Murphy says ('Handbook: Chronicles,' p. 116) that "it is plain that Zerah was a sovereign of Kush, who in the reign of Takeloth, about  <span class="date">B.C. 944</span>, invaded Egypt and penetrated into Asia," the balance of probability, both from the names themselves and the synchronisms of history, corroborated by the composition of Zerah's army (Cushim and Lubim, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-8.htm">2 Chronicles 16:8</a>) and some other tributary considerations, is that our <span class="accented">Zerah</span> was Usarken II., the fourth king of the twenty-second dynasty (or possibly Usarken I., the second king of the dynasty). The invasion of the text was probably in Asa's fourteenth year, his reign thus far being dated  <span class="date">B.C. 953-940</span> (or  <span class="date">B.C. 933-920</span> if Manasseh's be taken at only thirty-five instead of fifty-five years). The alleged army of this Zerah was an Egyptian army, largely made of mercenaries (compare the description of Shishak's army, ch. 12:3). The present defeat of Zerah would go far to explain the known decline of the Egyptian power at just this date, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> some twenty-five to thirty years after Shishak. At the same time, it must be admitted that it is not possible to identify with certainty Zerah with either Usarken. Whether he is an unknown Arabian Cushite, or an unknown African Cushite of Ethiopia-above-Egypt, or one of the Usarkens, has yet to be pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">Mareshah</span> (see our note, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). It lay the "second mile" (Eusebius and Jerome) south of Eleutheropolis and between Hebron (1 Maccabees 5:36; 2 Maccabees 12:35) and Ashdod (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:08. &sect; 6). The mention of the valley of Zephathah in the following verse will half identify its exact position. It is probable that Dr. Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 2:67) and Toblev in his interesting , Dritto Wand.' (pp. 129, 142), have reliably fixed the site one Roman mile south-west of the modern <span class="accented">Beit-Jibrin.</span> Mareshah is again mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-37.htm">2 Chronicles 20:37</a> and <a href="../../par/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>, as quoted already, in references interesting to be consulted. A thousand thousand. Whether this number be correct or not, it may be noted that it is the largest alleged number of an army given in the Old Testament.

Probably the correcter rendering of our present Hebrew text would be, "It makes no difference with thee to help those whose strength is great or whose strength is nothing (between the much <span class="accented">even</span> to the none of strength)." Keil and Bertheau would translate "There is none beside thee." For another instance of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, see <a href="../../par/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6</a>; and comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-13.htm">2 Chronicles 1:13</a>. The prayer must be counted a model prayer to an omnipotent Deliverer. It consists of opening invocation and the instancing of what postulates the crowning Divine attribute as the broad foundation for argument; of invocation repeated, warmed to closer clinging by the appropriating "oar;" attended by the defining, though very universal petition, <span class="cmt_word">Help us</span>; and followed by the argument of the unbending fidelity of trusting dependence, For we rest <span class="cmt_word">on thee, and in thy Name we go against this multitude</span>; and, lastly, of invocation renewed or still determinedly sustained, pressed home by the clenching challenge of relationship and its correlative responsibility and presumable holy pride. The antithesis marked in these two last clauses will not escape notice - one made all the bolder, with the marginal reading of "mortal mall" for the emphatic (a poetical, universal kind of) word here employed (<span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>) for man.

The use of the word here, though unique, will occasion no surprise, considering the camping of the vast invading army. <span class="cmt_word">Camels in abundance</span>. The mention of this spoil reminds us both where we are, on desert border (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-7.htm">1 Samuel 27:7-10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-16.htm">1 Samuel 30:16, 17</a>), and what was the personality or nationality within some latitude of choice of the invaders. <span class="cmt_word">Returned to Jerusalem</span>. The expression awakens inevitably, though inaptly, a reminiscence of Scripture language in strangest contrast - the climax in a description also, but of a victory infinitely vaster and grander and for ever (<a href="../../par/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>). This return of "Asa and the people that were with him" to Jerusalem dated the commencement of a period of comparative internal peace and reform for the kingdom of Judah, that lasted twenty-one years, and yet more of exemption from Egyptian attack, that lasted about three hundred and thirty years (B.C. circ. 940-609). It was a doubtful benefit, but Judah and Egypt came to be found in alliance against Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-3.htm">2 Kings 17:3-6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-20.htm">2 Kings 18:20, 21, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-2.htm">Isaiah 30:2</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>). The 'Speaker's Commentary' points out the interesting fact that this was one of the only two occasions known of the Jews meeting in open field either Egypt or Assyria (the other occasion being the unfortunate one of Josiah against Necho, 2 Chronicles 35:30), and adds, "Shishak, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, Nebuchadnezzar, Alexander, and Ptolemy I., were either unopposed or only opposed from behind wails." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The grand original of the expression is, of course, found in <a href="../../par/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>, where the name is "God." Compare Pharaoh's question in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-38.htm">Genesis 41:38</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-31.htm">Exodus 35:31</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-2.htm">Numbers 24:2</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> (the verb "clothed" is used in this last); five other times in Judges we have the Spirit of the Lord; in Samuel six times, and "the Spirit of God" another six times; in Kings, three times "the Spirit of the Lord." These passages exhibit incontestably the function, and the manifold function, of the Spirit! <span class="cmt_word">Azariah the son of Oded.</span> The Vulgate and Alexandrian Septuagint read here simply <span class="accented">Oded</span>; and Movers (p. 261) has suggested that "Oded the son of Azariah" is the correct reading for what now stands in the text; these are contrivances to meet the difficulty which the eighth verse occasions, and they are not so simple certainly as the proposal of Keil and Bertheau (following the Arabic Version) to omit altogether from ver. 8 the repetition of the name of the prophet, under the plea that the words, "of Oded the prophet," may so conceivably be owing to a copyist's meddlesome marginal reminiscence of ver. 1. It would have been, perhaps, a yet simpler method of overcoming the difficulty to account that the words, "Azariah the son of," had through a copy error slipped out of the text, except that the previous word, "the prophecy," is <span class="accented">not in</span> the construct state, and this favours Keil and Bertheau's suggestion (see our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>), or rather the suggestion of the Arabic Version, which before them omits the words, "of Oded the prophet." The Vatican Septuagint has the readings in beth verses as Englished in the Authorized Version. Some think Oded may be one with Iddo of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-29.htm">2 Chronicles 9:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-15.htm">2 Chronicles 12:15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-22.htm">2 Chronicles 13:22</a>; pointing out that the Hebrew characters would permit it, if we suppose a <span class="accented">vau</span> added to the name Oded. This conjectural attempt to give this Prophet Azariah for son to Iddo seems to gain no great point. Of this Azariah nothing else is known; he is described as "son of Oded" probably to distinguish him from Azariah the high priest, son of Johanan (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:142, second column, 3). (For the rest on this subject, see note on ver. 8.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD <i>is</i> with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went out to meet him;</span> literally, <span class="accented">into his presence</span>; but the Authorized Version rendering is very correct, as well as happy in expression (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8</a>; also see the remarkable and interesting verse, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-9.htm">2 Chronicles 28:9</a>). The prophet was the leader, the teacher, the suggester of the right and opportune thing to the people, but to the prophet the Lord himself was Leader, Teacher, Prompter, and it was exactly so now. To the very moment, the quickened moment of new thought and for new deed, divinest instruction and suggestion are ministered. The Lord is with you...  will forsake you. The original occasion of the beautiful language and word of covenant in the heart of this second part of the verse is enshrined in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11-14</a>). It is just conceivable that these words by themselves are what are designated "the prophecy" (<span class="accented">and</span> "the prophecy") in ver. 8. They may be in the first place regarded as ancient quotations. They are also characterized by a certain self-containedness and weightiness of matter as compared with the historic illustrations of the following four verses. No corroborative <span class="accented">external</span> evidence of this conjecture, however, is forthcoming. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">Now for a long season Israel <i>hath been</i> without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now for a long season</span>. This translation is wrong; translate rather first, <span class="accented">And many the days to Israel to not have true God, and to not have teaching priest, and to not have Law</span>. So far no tense is limited, however naturally through the very drift of the passage it may seem that <span class="accented">experience</span> is being challenged, and so necessarily the past tense desiderated, not, however, in <span class="accented">aorist</span> shape, but in what some French grammarians call present perfect. For Azariah may well contemplate his illustration as good from long of old, to the very moment he was speaking. The unfortunate wealth of illustration to hand of his position may pardon the doubtfulness of commentators as to the source from which it may be supposed he would have drawn his most effective instances. It will not be the unlikeliest guide to follow the triple description of the alleged apostasy, misfortune, or iniquity "of Israel," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> (say) it <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the true God</span>; <span class="accented">happened to</span> them <span class="cmt_word">to not have teaching priest</span>; <span class="accented">happened</span> to them <span class="cmt_word">to not have the Law</span> (this meaning, to not have it authoritatively proclaimed, taught, ministered). When did these three things <span class="accented">happen</span> altogether most notoriously? They describe, not the transgressions of an individual king, but the state of the people and kingdom as a whole. If it were possible to conceive the description as a flagrant anachronism, a retrospective post-Captivity amplification, which the writer (in his glow of work and thought) was unconsciously and irresistibly betrayed into putting into the lips of the Prophet Azariah, all doubt would end; for the description would suit no state of things and no period better than that of the divided kingdoms, especially applying to the career of the separate kingdom of Israel. Our account, unfortunately, is unchecked just here by a parallel. It is, however, impossible to suppose this without any tittle of external authority for it, much less enough to proceed upon. Some so crave the illustration that they are prepared to suppose all the tenses of these verses present and future rather than past and "present perfect." But, in fact, no doubt the history of Israel since the death of Moses illustrated the language of Azariah <span class="accented">passim</span> to a degree beyond all "that is written" or that we know. And then we may certainly consider theft the expression chosen, "many days" (which some translate "many a day," "many a time "), even the word "years" not being employed, leaves it open to us to go to short episodes of an irreligious and disastrous character in the history of Israel. Lastly, the long stretch of fully three hundred years, extending throughout the Book of Judges (its last five chapters in right order or wrong)into the opening seven chapters of 1 Samuel, provides one running comment, superabundant almost to repetitiousness, for the illustration of our vers. 3-7; in many cases absolutely <span class="accented">picking out</span> the very colours to match (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-29.htm">Judges 20:29, 31</a>, compared with our ver. 5). To distinguish and separate the very numerous references that might be made is merely supererogatory, and spoils the unmatched mosaic work of the history (<a href="../../par/judges/2-15.htm">Judges 2:15, 18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12-15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-1.htm">Judges 4:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-6.htm">Judges 5:6, 19-21, 31</a>: 6:1-5, 7-10; 9:32-37; 10:6-16; 11:19, 20; 12:5, 6; 17:5, 6, 13; 20:29, 31; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30 -35</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9-22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). It is a long-stretched-out history of a practically atheistic, priest-less, lawless life; divided into narratives of invasion, oppression, servitude (sevenfold, the Mesopotamian, Moabite, Canaanitish, Midianitish, Ammonitish, Philistine, and, it may be added, in order to comprehend all internal strife, Ishmaelitish larger and lesser, yet surprisingly general), smart, cry for help manifestly more the cry of pain and cowardice than of penitence and repentance, resolution and vow, and - for another trial and still another - of Divine pity, forbearance, and deliverance

At the same time, the work that would devolve on Asa in <span class="accented">holding</span> the cities his father Abijah had first taken, may easily account for all, and have been accounted Asa's taking, in the sense of <span class="accented">taking</span> to them, or retaking them. <span class="cmt_word">Renewed the altar</span>. The altar, the place of which was <span class="cmt_word">before the porch</span>, was the altar of burnt offering. The Hebrew for "renewed" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Vulgate translates insufficiently <span class="accented">dedicavit.</span> Bertheau thinks the renewal designs simply the purification of it from idolatrous defilements, although he admits that this is to assume that it had been defiled by idolatrous priests. Keil says the altar might well need genuine repair after the lapse of sixty years from the building of the temple. Of the nine occurrences of the word. five are metaphorical(as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>), but of the remaining four distinctly literal uses, including the present, three must mean just strictly "repair" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-4.htm">Isaiah 61:4</a>), and the probability may therefore be that such is the meaning now. Many, however, prefer the other view. The work of Ass, as described in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-3.htm">2 Chronicles 14:3-5</a>, was one of taking away, breaking down, and cutting down; but this item shows it now, in his fifteenth year, become also one of renewing. and repairing.

Another significant comment on the sameness of human nature in all time; the weak and the multitude will see, learn, do duty, less under pure conviction of right, than under the strong commanding influence of observation of where and with whom success goes, even if that success necessitate the owning of the Divine blessing as its cause (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-16.htm">2 Chronicles 11:16</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-19.htm">1 Chronicles 12:19</a>).

The "lines" of the Simeonites fell to them originally (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1</a>) within Judah. The difficulty suggested by their being called, apparently, "strangers," and being certainly classed with the comers from "Ephraim and Manasseh," may be variously overcome, either by supposing that they had become more estranged from Judah in religious position than it was possible to them to have become in merely geographical; or that they had in some degree outgrown their own proper habitat, and had to some extent colonized a more northerly region (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>); or that, though, indeed, our compiler's composition undoubtedly places the Simeonites summoned, among <span class="accented">the strangers</span>, through mentioning them after Ephraim and Manasseh, yet this location of their name be held accidental, rather than due to special design.

The bribe that tempted him, drawn from "the treasures" described, well replenished (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-18.htm">2 Chronicles 15:18</a>; and parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-15.htm">1 Kings 15:15</a>), was probably large. His method was to create a diversion in favour of his new ally, by "smiting" certain picked and highly important cities of Israel, mostly in northern Galilee, by name "Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store-cities of Naphtalli." <span class="cmt_word">Ijon</span>. In Naphtali, mentioned only now, in the parallel, and when a second time taken (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>) by Tiglath-Pileser. <span class="cmt_word">Dan</span>. The colonizing of this city is given in <a href="../../par/judges/18-1.htm">Judges 18:1, 2, 29-31</a>; it was originally called Laish, and became the northern landmark of the whole country, as in the expression, "from Dan even to Beersheba" (Judges 17:29; 20:1). <span class="cmt_word">Abel-maim</span>. This place was situate at the foot of the Lebanon; in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>) it is called Abel-beth-maachah. It is again mentioned as attacked by Tiglath-Pileser, who wrested it from Pekah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18, 14, 15</a> it is called Abel by itself, but in the last two of these verses Beth-maachah is mentioned in close connection with it. After this name the parallel gives also "all Cinneroth" (Septuagint, "all the land of Cinnereth"). The name is the original of the New Testament <span class="accented">Gennesaret</span>. It was a city (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>) that gave its name to the sea and western region of the lake, sometimes called so (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a>). If there were a little more external evidence of it, we should incline to the opinion of Movers, that the "all Cinneroth" of the parallel is the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">"</span>all the store-cities") of our present verse. But at present we may take it that the two records supplement one another. <span class="cmt_word">All the store-cities of Naphtali</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-28.htm">2 Chronicles 32:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-6.htm">2 Chronicles 8:6</a> and its parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>).

The parallel has not this, but follows the exact previous sentence with this, "and dwelt in Tirzah." It is the happy suggestion of one commentator (Professor James G. Murphy, 'Handbook: Chronicles') that this sentence may betray that it had been Baasha's intention to reside in <span class="cmt_word">Ramah</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-6.htm">2 Chronicles 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The affair seems thus to have come to an unbloody termination. The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/15-22.htm">1 Kings 15:22</a>)is so much the more graphic that it contains the two additions that Asa "made a proclamation throughout all Judah," and one that "exempted none" from joining in the duty of moving all the stones and all the timber from Ramah, and diverting' them to the use of building Geba and Mizpah. This greatly contributed to command the road from the north to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Geba</span>. This was Geba of Benjamin, as clearly stated in the parallel. It was a position north of Ramah, whether opposite Michmash and the modern Jeba is not certain, as some think this answers to Gibeah of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2, 5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mizpah</span> (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-2.htm">Jeremiah 41:2, 3, 9, 10</a>). This Mizpah is not that of the Shefelah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>), but was situate about two hours, or a short six miles, north-west of Jerusalem, on the Samaria route, and is probably the modern <span class="accented">Neby Samwil</span> (see also <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-22.htm">2 Kings 25:22-26</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5-41:18</a>).

The fact furnishes clear indication that our compiler was not indebted to the writer of Kings for material. And the moral aspects of the matter here preserved by the compiler of Chronicles show the paramount reasons why he would not miss bringing it to the front for the returned people's better religious education. Presumably <span class="cmt_word">Hanani the seer</span> is the father of that other faithful seer and prophet Jehu, who appeared to Baasha (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1, 7</a>) and to Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-1.htm">2 Chronicles 19:1, 2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore is the host of the King of Syria escaped out of thy hand</span> It is plain that, reading the lines only, this expression (remarkable considering its following close upon successful help given by Benhadad, and help unaccompanied, so far as we are told, by any infidelity or untoward circumstance), suggests option of explanation, and would engender the supposition that something very threatening was on the horizon, at any rate. But reading <span class="accented">between the</span> lines, and giving due weight to the significance of the illustration adduced of the combined Ethiopians and Lubim (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-9.htm">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</a>), we may warrantably judge that Hanani's inspired language went a cut deeper, and meant that if the alliance had been not broken between Benhadad and Baasha, both would surely have been taken in one net (<a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>), as they would have entered into the conflict in alliance. A decisive victory over the King of Syria would have been any way a grand day in the history of Judah; But such a victory over the Kings of Syria and of the northern schismatic kingdom would have been more than a doubly grand day; it would have been a tenfold demonstration of God's judgment, that "though hand join in hand, yet shall not the wicked go unpunished" (see particularly same Hebrew verb used of a bird escaped in <a href="../../par/psalms/124-7.htm">Psalm 124:7</a>).

Although this language at first seems to be intended for very specific application to Asa, yet as we do not read of individual wars occurring after this in his own time, it is quite within a just interpretation of it if we read it as referring to the inevitable experience of the kingdom. Its head and king had just thrown away the opportunity of blocking out one ever-threatening enemy. What more natural consequence than that wars should rush in the rather as a flood, in the after-times?

(For a forcible parallel, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time</span>. This may throw some explanatory, though no exculpatory, light on Asa's wrath and violence towards Hanani; for it probably marks that either some goodly portion of the wiser of the people had anticipated of their own common sense the matter of the message of Hanani the seer, or that they had not failed to follow it with some keenly sympathetic remarks For our Authorized Version, "oppressed," read a stronger verb, as "crushed."

Note that the reference work cited in this verse as the book of the <span class="cmt_word">kings of Judah and Israel</span>, is in the paralled cited as "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah." Of course, the latter citation was much the earlier in point of time.

And it is somewhat remarkable that, when introduced to us as succeeding to the throne, nothing is said of his tender youth (as, for instance, is said in the case of Josiah, <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-1.htm">2 Kings 24:1-3</a>). Nevertheless, the apparent prominence of Maachah awhile would tally with the circumstance of Asa's youth at his accession. Another correspondence in Josiah's career is noticeable; for it is distinctly said that when he was only twelve years of age (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a>) "he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places," etc. At a similarly youthful age Asa, therefore, may be credited with doing the like, while later on he took more stringent measures, as for instance with Maachah, the queen-mother.

The use or associations of this word (found about fifty times) are almost entirely, if not entirely, those of the bed of nightly rest, even when not at the time speaking of nightly rest; and this is the first and only occasion that it is employed to link the grave in kindly analogy with the couch of bodily repose during lifetime. The fact might have suggested Bishop Ken's lines in the evening hymn - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>"<span class="accented">Teach me to live, that I may dread<br />The grave as little as my bed."</span> In the present instance, however, the writer, whoever he was (query, was he the compiler of our Chronicles, or his original?), is doubt-leas led to the analogy by considerations mere earthly than those enshrined in Ken's hymn, viz. by the somewhat "vain show" of attractiveness and fragrance (probably designed partly for preservative purposes) with which the place was filled, and which were among even patriarchal indications of faith in a future state. <span class="cmt_word">Sweet odours</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>.

It is not hard to see how they would both lead him, if not always out of big and patronizing thoughts, to seek and also lay him open to be sought. When this verse says Jehoshaphat joined affinity, etc., it means that he had done so. to wit, not fewer than nine years before, in promoting or allowing, whichever it was, the marriage of his son Jehoram with Ahab's and Jezebel's daughter Athaliah. For the issue of this marriage, Ahaziah, took the throne at the age of twenty-two years, thirteen years hence from this seventeenth year of his grandfather Jehoshaphat's reign, the year of Ahab's death. But as we are told that Ahaziah was the <span class="accented">youngest</span> son of Jehoram and Athaliah (for explanation of which see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), the "joining affinity" must have been something earlier than nine years, and very probably came yet nearer the prosperity of the earlier years of Jehoshaphat's reign, with which would agree well the keynote touched again significantly here from our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-5.htm">2 Chronicles 17:5</a>.

Although it is certain that the act of Jehoshaphat was wrong in principle, disastrous in practice (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2, 3</a>), and threatened fatal consequences to himself (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-31.htm">2 Chronicles 18:31, 32</a>), yet it is not impossible to suppose his motives were for the most part good, and he may naturally have thought that the sunshine of his own peace and abundance might be the set time to win influence in and over Israel, rather than strengthen Israel in its ungodly independence. On the other hand, nothing could justify Jehoshaphat risking such intimacy of relationship with such a family, heedless of consequences, looking towards idolatry, which he should have known were overwhelmingly probable.

This journey to Samaria to see Ahab was made in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-51.htm">1 Kings 22:51</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a> and <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>). What were the precise antecedent circumstances of this visit of Jehoshaphat to Ahab it is interesting to surmise - whether it were the fruit of an invitation direct from Ahab, who had his own designs, or whether it were for diplomatic reasons, that worked in the mind of Jehoshaphat as well as of Ahab, in view of Syria. It is evident that Ahab promptly determined to improve this conference of kings. <span class="cmt_word">Persuaded him</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he took steps to induce him. This is the uniform signification of the word here used in the eighteen times of its occurrence, and mostly in doubtful, or worse than doubtful, matter. The form is the hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, in which conjugation only the verb occurs. The Revised Version renders "moved." The visiting and cooperating of Jehoshaphat and Ahab made a novel departure in the history of the rended kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and continued till the time of Jehu. <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth-Gilead</span>. This important city of Gad (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), in Palestine beyond Jordan, comes into question as one not surrendered to the king-dora of Israel in good faith, according to the promise of Benhadad (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>; comp. 1, 4, 7, 11, 20, 30, 33), Benhadad's father having taken it from Omri, father of Ahab. For "all the might that he showed," and presumably in conflicts with Syria, Omri was evidently a heavy loser. <span class="accented">Ramoth-Gilead</span> means "the heights of Gilead." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a></div><div class="verse">And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead?

Whether on the one occasion or the other, it is quite possible that Jehoshaphat thought he was serving common interests, and the cause of his own kingdom, as well as of Israel; nevertheless "Jehu the son of Hanani the seer" ignores the supposed justification (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>).

At any rate, his counsel is right, even to the point of urging to-day, and significantly deprecating procrastination. It is not, however, so clear that he was, in the first instance, as decided in respect of the necessity of inquiring the will of the Lord at the mouth of a true prophet, in distinction from a prophet merely of Israel, though they should be "four hundred" in number! Compare the following two verses, however, which show as though he was holding himself quite prepared and on the look-out for the expected occasion of having to rein Ahab up! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-5.htm">2 Chronicles 18:5</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear?

Their <span class="accented">word</span> speedily showed itself <span class="accented">not</span> the <span class="accented">word of the Lord</span>, but the word that was made up to order of the king, and to suit his known wish at any time.

Any way, the unreal prophets have their full opportunity and their say at least twice over, as also Micaiah below (vers. 14, 16, 18-22, 27).

Micaiah begins by answering a fool according to his folly, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> according to his own heart's desire.

How it was that their contents did not avail with Jehoshaphat to throw full energy again into his conscience, and to enable him to break at once with Ahab and his expedition, is inexplicable (and the more as it was his own pressing suggestion that the true prophet should be summoned), except as another illustration of the fearful difficulty that lies so often to human weakness, in the way of retracing a false step. Both these visions (vers. 16, 18-22) well illustrate how God revealed his truth, will and specific messages to his true prophets <span class="accented">in vision</span>. The vision of the throne, grand in all the majesty of its simplicity, of the psalmists (9, 11, 45, 103.), of Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>), of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>), of Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>), of Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>), of St. John (<a href="../../par/revelation/4-2.htm">Revelation 4:2</a>), is part of heaven's own stamp of authentication of the Bible.

He declares, on the authority of his rapt vision, that it is because <span class="accented">they</span> are possessed by a lying spirit (<a href="../../par/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:12</a>).

Keil and Bertheau correctly say, - in that Zedekiah used the force and the language that he did, it is not a bad sign that he was under a spirit's influence, but in that it was <span class="accented">physical</span> force which he used in a moral subject, this was a conclusive sign of the <span class="accented">character</span> of the spirit that he was amenable to. Among many possible suggestions as to the exact meaning of the question, "Which way," etc.? it is possible that a sceptical taunt best explains Zedekiah's words, and that he meant that he did not believe the Spirit of the Lord went <span class="accented">any</span> way to Micaiah. He will not yield to a doubt or to a suspicion thrown upon it that the Spirit had been with himself, and he will fain throw great doubt, whether he had proceeded from him to Micaiah!

The last of these three words tells, of course, its own tale, of what had already been the treatment accorded to Micaiah. <span class="cmt_word">Amon the governor...

The Vulgate translates the Hebrew for "the king's," as though it were a proper name, "Amelech." See also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' under the name "Maaseiah" 17. Nor is <span class="accented">Amon</span> <span class="accented">the governor</span> known elsewhere except in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>), but these designations, as through some chinks, throw a little scanty light into the subject of the internal administration at this time of the kingdom of Israel. In this kingdom subsequent to the separation, decentralization seems to have been carried to a further point than in Judah, and considering its greater extent, its far inferior metropolitan force, its double place of worship and sacrifice, these largely idolatrous, and in all this the undoubted degraded authority of its central government, this is very explainable. It is true that in both kingdoms history speaks equally of such offices and officers as were distinctly military or looked that way, but it can scarcely be without a reason that for the numerous allusions in Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-8.htm">1 Kings 16:8-10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-7.htm">1 Kings 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8-17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-6.htm">2 Kings 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>) to councils of elders (well known before the disruption), and governors of palaces, of cities, of houses, and of provinces, there is scarcely one in the records of Judah. Here possibly enough the executive would be more vigorous, more compact, and more direct and close in its action from headquarters, while in both divisions of what should have been the one kingdom, royalty was by profession constitutional, and in its devolution hereditary.

Therefore, if the place of vers. 29, 30 were inverted, what reads like the cool suggestion of Ahab in ver. 29 would seem more tolerable.

The arrow went through, or by the side of one of the actual articulations of the armour-mail worn. Ahab's direction to the chariot-driver at the spur of the first wounded moment to turn and carry him <span class="cmt_word">out of the host</span>, was evidently qualified, when he found that the wound was not immediately fatal. As the heat of the battle grew, and victory did not at once turn one way or the other, he was the more anxious to give the moral support of his presence to the last to his army, and, unable to stand by himself, he was supported by his own orders (so our rendering is not inconsistent with that in the parallel "<span class="accented">was stayed"</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>) in the chariot till he died in the evening. Although the spirit of Ahab, and his fidelity to his own army, kingdom, and self, cannot but appear to advantage in these last incidents of his unworthy life, yet it is probable that they find their record here for the sake of giving clear statement to the fact, that in the chariot his life-bleed collected according to the saying of the parallel (ver. 35 compared with ver. 38). Note, therefore, particularly the truncated history of the writer of Chronicles in this instance. He, no doubt, consciously omitted, and with a purpose, his own usual purpose; but light is lost, and the cross light tends rather to misleading, except for that only correct user of Scripture, which teaches us to compare one Scripture with another, and balance one part against another - a thing easy to do in matters of fact, but too often forgotten in the weightier matter of doctrine. Here our eighteenth chapter closes, less the mention of the proclamation for the self-disbanding of Ahab's army (ver. 36 of the parallel chapter) which should fulfil the prophecy of our ver. 16, and less any mention of Ahab's burial, of the washing of his chariot in the pool of Samaria, of the dogs licking up of the blood there, and of his ivory house, etc. (vers. 37-40 of the parallel chapter). All of which omittings accord well with the one clear ecclesiastical and religious intent of the Chronicles, in place of the pursuit of matters of general and merely graphic historic interest, however charged with instruction they too might be. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

For Hanani, the faithful father of a faithful son, see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-7.htm">2 Chronicles 16:7-10</a>, where we read that he "came to Asa King of Judah," etc. Also for Jehu, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1-4</a>, where we read of his commission at the word of the Lord to rebuke Baasha the King of Israel, at a date upwards of thirty years before the present; and see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>, which would lead us to infer, though not with certainty, that he outlived Jehoshaphat. The book called by his name, however, was not necessarily finished by him. It is evident that neither the word of the Lord nor the messengers and prophets of the Lord were bound by the orthodox limits of the divided kingdom. The powerful character and the moral force of the true prophet is again seen (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1-8</a>) in the way in which he was wont to <span class="accented">go</span> <span class="accented">out to meet</span> the evil-doer, though he were a king. We are accustomed to set the whole of this down to the account of the special inspiration of the prophet of old; yet <span class="accented">that</span> was but typical of the intrinsic force that truth faithfully spoken should wield in its own right in later times. Religion is <span class="accented">established</span> in the nation and people that know and do this, by the accredited teachers of it, vie. the plain rebuke of the wrong. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest thou...  love them that hate the Lord</span>? Strong suspicion must attend upon Jehoshaphat, that he had been not a little misled by answering to some personal fascination in Ahab. The prophet's rebuke is not that Jehoshaphat helped both Israel and therein Judah also against a common foe, but that he helped the ungodly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore wrath upon thee</span>, etc. The significance of this sentence was probably not merely retrospective, glancing at the fact that Jehoshaphat returned to Jerusalem <span class="accented">minus</span> the victory for which he had bid, but was probably an intimation of troubles that should ripen, were already ripening for Jehoshaphat, in the coming invasion of his own kingdom (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-3</a>).

Jehoshaphat makes another conscientious and vigorous endeavour to reform his own kingdom, to keep it steadfast in the worship of God, and free from idolatry. It is to be noticed that he does not turn away his ear from the rebuke which had been given him, but turns his heart to it. As it does not appear that he broke with Israel and Israel's kings (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35, 37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-7.htm">2 Kings 3:7, 14, 24</a>), it is possible, especially in view of ver. 37 in our ch. 20, that the severity of the Divine rebuke was understood to apply to the occasions which found Jehoshaphat in alliance with a king notably bad, and for some supposed chance of advantage to himself. This last element of consideration will difference sufficiently the two cases just cited, to wit, the case in which Jehoshaphat joined himself with Azariah, and is sternly "prophesied against," and that in which he helped Jehoram, and through Elisha's intervention gained him the day. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-5.htm">2 Chronicles 19:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges...  fenced cities</span>. Jehoshaphat proceeds from direct religious reforms to that which is of importance only second in the life of a nation - reform in the matter of civil administration of justice. The skeleton here given of what should be the character of a <span class="accented">judge</span>, and why, harmonizes well with the uniform stress laid in Scripture upon "justice and judgment." It is hard indeed to see, rather impossible, upon what foundation a sure structure of civil growth and stability can be laid, except on that of positive religion. Note the positions and the succinct arguments of vers. 6, 7; and how unequivocally they are based upon faith in a personal God, and upon his revealed character. It can scarcely be that this was the first time of judges being set in the cities of Judah but possibly the meaning intended to be conveyed with emphasis is, that now, looking well round his kingdom, he took care that all the cities should be properly provided with the necessary judges, while of late some had been, and some had not, and some, though they had been officered with judges, had found them not what judges ought to be. The immense majority of the "six thousand" Levite "officers and judges" of David's regulation (1 Chronicles 23:4; 36:29) had, with their superiors, kings and prophets, gone astray. With our present passage may be compared <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where the original enactment of judges and officers is narrated. <span class="accented">Fenced cities</span>.

The word occurs twenty-six times from the Book of Numbers to the Book of the Prophet Zechariah, and is rendered in the Authorized Version "fenced" or "defenced" twenty-two times, "walled" twice, "strong" once, and "mighty" once.

The beautiful New Testament equivalent occurs in <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>, and elsewhere. Like some other of those earliest concisest religious expressions, brevity and simplicity are fully charged with suggestion. And the above quotations will be found to furnish examples of the manifold practical use of the Lord's <span class="accented">presence</span> with any one. That presence may infer the help just of companionship, or of sure sympathy, or of needed counsel, or of strength in the hour of temptation, or of absolute practical help, or of the highest revealings of faith. The whole circle of need, of human and Christian need, the Divine presence "will supply" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>). The "need" of Solomon in his present position was patent and pressing. Would that he had always kept by the true supply of it! <span class="cmt_word">Magnified him exceedingly</span>. This verb in its piel conjugation, signifying "to make grow," occurs twenty-six times in the various books of the Old Testament, some of the more characteristic occurrences of it being found in the following passages: <a href="../../par/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/4-17.htm">Joshua 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-37.htm">1 Kings 1:37, 47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-6.htm">2 Kings 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/job/7-17.htm">Job 7:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-14.htm">Isaiah 44:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-5.htm">Daniel 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>.

Our present verse purports to show the <span class="accented">representative</span> components of "all Israel" in a fourfold classification. <span class="cmt_word">Captains of thousands and of hundreds</span> (see first <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>; and then <a href="../../par/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-14.htm">Numbers 31:14, 48, 52, 54</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-12.htm">1 Samuel 8:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-18.htm">1 Samuel 17:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-7.htm">1 Samuel 22:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-1.htm">2 Samuel 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9, 15, 19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The judges</span>. The office and the person of the judge were held in high honour among the Jewish people from the first, and perhaps, also, with a noteworthy uniformity, even in the more degenerate periods of their history. Their commencement in patriarchal simplicity can be easily imagined, and receives illustration from such passages as <a href="../../par/job/29-7.htm">Job 29:7, 8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/job/32-9.htm">Job 32:9</a>. Their more formal development may be considered to date from the crisis related in <a href="../../par/exodus/18-14.htm">Exodus 18:14-24</a>. And the allusions to the judge and his office thenceforward sustain our impression of the honour in which they were held, arising, no doubt, largely from the deep-felt necessity for them, the more society crystallized (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-17.htm">Deuteronomy 19:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-2.htm">Deuteronomy 21:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8-10</a>). In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-24.htm">1 Chronicles 23:24</a> we are told how David set apart "six thousand Levites" to be "officers and judges." <span class="cmt_word">Every governor</span>. The word employed here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) is rendered by five different words in our Authorized Version: "prince" (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "ruler" (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-22.htm">Exodus 16:22</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "captain" (<a href="../../par/numbers/2-3.htm">Numbers 2:3</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>), "chief" Numbers 3:24, <span class="accented">passim</span>), and "governor" in the present passage only. It is evidently a term of generic signification, used of a king (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-34.htm">1 Kings 11:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-10.htm">Ezekiel 12:10</a>); of leaders of the Ishmaelites (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>); of the captains of the tribes of Israel (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-11.htm">Numbers 7:11</a>); of the chiefs of families (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-24.htm">Numbers 3:24</a>); while the use of it (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-6.htm">Genesis 23:6</a>) to set forth the position of Abraham as one raised to eminence so high and undisputed that it might be clearly said to be God's doing, is sufficient to determine its <span class="accented">central</span> signification<span class="cmt_word">. The chief of the fathers</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the heads of the fathers. The first occurrence of the expression, "the heads of their fathers' houses" (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-14.htm">Exodus 6:14</a>), and of "the heads <span class="accented">of the fathers</span> of the Levites according to their families" (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>), sufficiently explains the original and perfectly natural meaning of the phrase. The great importance and significance of the position of the heads "of families" and "of houses" and" of fathers" in early patriarchal times must necessarily have declined by the time of Solomon, when the nation had received so much more of civil form and system. But the name remained, and the family and social position did not fail to make themselves felt, and finally the <span class="accented">official</span> recognition of them in David's time is evidenced by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>, and in Solomon's time both by the present passage and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a> with its parallel <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>. Our present use of the expression ought probably to show it, in close apposition with the foregoing words, "to all Israel" (wrongly translated "in all Israel" in the Authorized Version), and which itself is a repetition of the "to all Israel" in the beginning of the verse. Although the existing Hebrew pointing of the verse does not favour the supposition, it may be that the writer means to emphasize Solomon's summons as made both to the kingdom as such, and to the people also as a united people. We are not, indeed, told here, in so many words, what it was that Solomon said "to all Israel." But there can be no doubt as to his object, as betrayed in the first clause of the following verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-3.htm">2 Chronicles 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that <i>was</i> at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - All the congregation; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the persons of their captains, judges, princes, and family representatives. <span class="cmt_word">The high place... at Gibeon</span>. It may readily be allowed that even nature and instinct would suggest a certain fitness in selecting <span class="accented">high</span> places, and the impressive grandeur of groves, for the worship of the High and Lofty One and for the offerings of sacrifice to him. It was not otherwise historically (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-54.htm">Genesis 31:54</a>). However<span class="accented">, first</span>, it was part of the education of a nation (situated in the heart of the young world) in the unity of the one God, that its worship should be offered in one place, and the smoke of its sacrifices ascend from <span class="accented">one</span> altar; and <span class="accented">secondly</span>, it was not difficult to foresee that the very force that lay in the associations, which dictated the choice of some places (not least, certainly, "the grove"), would constitute their weakness and snare. The prohibitions, therefore, of the Mosaic Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 26</a>), witnessed to by such corroborations as are found in commands to obliterate certain Canaanitish traces, that looked long time a different way (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-52.htm">Numbers 33:52</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>), approve themselves as in thorough harmony with what all would feel to be the genius of the religious education of Israel, and, through Israel, of the nations of the world. The wonder that impresses us is rather that means were not found to abide by the "letter" of the Law to a far greater degree during all the generations that elapsed before the people were settled in their land, and were gathered in their temple so typical. Is it not possible to regard this as an impressive instance of how, even in a system that sought to be of the closest and most exclusive, the "<span class="accented">spirit</span>," by force of circumstances, resented the tyrannous bondage of the "letter"? Anyway, for ages from the time of that prohibition, the nation had the moral principle as their guide rather than any possibility of keeping safe within a commandment's "letter" (so see <a href="../../par/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-10.htm">1 Samuel 7:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-26.htm">1 Chronicles 21:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30</a>). Even now, accordingly, the prohibited is still the observed, and by Solomon, too, in the steps of David, even if it be necessary to describe it as the "winked at." And to the "high place" at Gibeon Solomon and all the representatives, <span class="accented">the congregation</span> of Israel, have to repair in order to do sacrifice. The tabernacle was now at Gibeon, whither it had come from Nob (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1, 6</a>; from which latter reference, speaking of the "shew-bread," it comes that we know the tabernacle to have resided at Nob awhile; for the circumstance is not positively narrated in any passage of the history (but see also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9, 11</a>). <span class="accented">Gibeon</span> was one of the four Hivite cities, the other three being Beeroth, Chephirah, and Kirjath-jearim. It had its first fame from its "wiliness" (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 4</a>, etc.). By the directest road, it was five miles distant from Jerusalem, in the direction of the sea. It was further noted for the encounter between Joab and Abner (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-12.htm">2 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). Again, for the slaying of Amasa by Joab (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6-10</a>), and for the death of Joab himself at the hand of Benalak, at the very horns of the altar (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-28.htm">1 Kings 2:28-34</a>). Although the exact date of the lodging of the tabernacle at Gibeon is not told us, nor even the person who was answerable for briging it there, yet there can be no reasonable doubt that it was David, as we read (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-40.htm">1 Chronicles 16:40</a>) of his appointing the priests to offer "the daily sacrifices" there, on the brazen altar of Moses, when Zadok was at their head, and Heman and Jeduthun were their resident musicians. In what particular part of Gibeon or of its immediate neighbourhood the tabernacle was stationed cannot be said with any certainty. Amid a considerable choice of likely places, one forming part of Gibeon itself, and just south of <span class="accented">El-Tib</span>, seems the likeliest, and to be preferred to the suggestion of Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 216), of <span class="accented">Neby-Samuil</span>, which is a mile distant. The present imposing occasion is the last of any importance on which Gibeon is brought before us (see also <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-35.htm">1 Chronicles 9:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There was the tabernacle</span>. The removal of the tabernacle to Gibeon no doubt followed immediately on the destruction of Nob by Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39, 40</a>, compared with 37; 21:28, 29). <span class="cmt_word">Moses... made in the wilderness</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 27, 33:7-10</a>).

Again, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, the writer emphasizes the fact of the temporary divorce that had obtained between the ark and the tabernacle (so <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2-19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2, 4, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-3.htm">1 Chronicles 13:3-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1-3, 12-15, 23-29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">David's pitching of the tent</span> for it is recorded emphatically <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-1.htm">1 Chronicles 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>.

This statement is introduced to lay stress on the fact that, though the ark indeed was not with the tabernacle, the brazen altar of burnt offering assuredly was there, this constituting the place, the proper spot, for sacrifice and worship. (For the account of the brazen altar and its making, see <a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/38-1.htm">Exodus 38:1-7</a>; also <a href="../../par/numbers/16-38.htm">Numbers 16:38, 39</a>.)

The reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), "was <span class="accented">there</span> before<span class="accented"></span>," is to be preferred, tallying as it does exactly with <a href="../../par/exodus/40-6.htm">Exodus 40:6</a>.

The analogy of the use of this word would make to be preferred the translation "sought him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "Jehovah" just spoken cf. But whether the object of the verb be in this place Jehovah or the altar, it would seem probable that the clause purports to say that Solomon and his people were accustomed to repair thither, while now they were about to repair thither with a very vast burnt offering.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-8.htm">2 Chronicles 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast showed great mercy unto David my father</span>. These also are the exact words found in the parallel place, but they omit the words, "thy servant," before "David," found there. <span class="cmt_word">And hast made me to reign in his stead</span>. This concise expression takes the place of two equivalent expressions, found at the end of the sixth and beginning of the seventh verses in the parallel passage, the former of which passages also describes it as "this great kindness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> kindness on the part of God - a description very much in harmony with David's own grateful acknowledgment to God (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>). Up to this point our present account differs from its parallel in cutting out Solomon's eulogy of his father ("According as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee"), and his humbler disparagement of himself ("And I, a little child, know not how to go out or come in"). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-9.htm">2 Chronicles 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father</span> <span class="cmt_word">be established.</span> This challenge on the part of Solomon, intended, without doubt, most reverently, is not given in the parallel place, and forms not only a distinctive but an interesting additional feature of the present account. It is thought by some that the "promise "here challenged is not very distinctly recorded anywhere, but surely passages like <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/17-12.htm">1 Chronicles 17:12-14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-10.htm">1 Chronicles 22:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-6.htm">1 Chronicles 28:6, 7</a> amply meet the case. See also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12, 15</a>. <span class="cmt_word">King over a people like the dust</span>. It is noteworthy that, though the equivalent of this phrase is found in the parallel, the distinctiveness of this <span class="accented">simile</span> is not found there. (For the use of the simile to express a vast number, see <a href="../../par/genesis/28-14.htm">Genesis 28:14</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/23-10.htm">Numbers 23:10</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/1-17.htm">Zephaniah 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-3.htm">Zechariah 9:3</a>.) It is not at all of frequent use in Scripture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-10.htm">2 Chronicles 1:10</a></div><div class="verse">Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, <i>that is so</i> great?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give me now wisdom and knowledge</span>. The force of the opening of this verse, and the relation of it to the former, are both prejudiced by the "now" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) being deposed from its right position as the <span class="accented">first</span> word in the verse. For the rest of this verse, the parallel passage has "an understanding heart" in place of our "wisdom <span class="accented">and knowledge</span>;" and "that I may discern between good and bad," in place of our <span class="cmt_word">that I may go out and come in before this people</span>. In using the words, "wisdom and knowledge," Solomon seems to have remembered well the prayer of his father (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12</a>). (For the pedigree of the simple and effective phrase, "know how to go out and come in," see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-25.htm">2 Samuel 3:25</a>). It is at the same time refreshing to revisit the times when the most exalted nominal ruler was also the real ruler, as being the leader, the judge, the teacher in the highest sense, and "the feeder" of his people. Nor is it less refreshing to notice how, in Israel at least, the fact was so well recognized and honoured, that <span class="accented">justice</span> and <span class="accented">to judge just judgment</span> lay at the deepest foundation of civil society. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-11.htm">2 Chronicles 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - With this verse the answer to Solomon's prayer begins. It is here concisely given in two verses, but occupies five (vers. 10-14) in the parallel place, including the verse not found here, which says, "The speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing." Otherwise there is no essential difference of any importance, though it may be noted that the parallel gives voice to the promise of "length of days," on the condition of Solomon fulfilling his part in showing obedience to the Divine will, and in following the steps of his father. <span class="cmt_word">Riches, wealth</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The most elementary idea of the former of these two words seems to be "straight growth," "prosperity;" of the latter, "to gather together" or "heap up." The former is found first in <a href="../../par/genesis/31-16.htm">Genesis 31:16</a>; and in the verb (hiph. conjugation) in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-23.htm">Genesis 14:23</a>. Afterwards it is found in almost all of the historical books, in the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and in the prophets Jeremiah and Daniel. The latter word occurs only five times (<a href="../../par/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a>; in this and the following verses; and in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-19.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/6-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 6:2</a>). Its Chaldee form is also found in <a href="../../par/ezra/6-8.htm">Ezra 6:8</a> and Ezra 7:26. A comparison of these passages scarcely sustains the supposition of some, suggested by the derivation of the word, that it marks specially those stores of useful things which constituted largely the wealth of Old Testament times. <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom and knowledge</span>. The distinction between these is evident, as also that they are needful complements of one another for the forming of a catholic, useful, sound character. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wisdom and knowledge <i>is</i> granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that <i>have been</i> before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Such as none of the kings... before thee, neither... after thee.</span> These words were sadly ominous of the short-lived glory of the kingdom Only two kings had reigned before Solomon in Israel, and the glory of the kingdom too surely culminated in his reign, and even before the end of it (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-22.htm">2 Chronicles 9:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-25.htm">1 Chronicles 29:25</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:9</a>). On the other hand, the gratuitous and spontaneous fulness of promise in the Divine reply to a human prayer that "pleased" the Being invoked is most noticeable, and preached beforehand indeed, the lesson of the life of Jesus, "Seek ye first the kingdom... and all these things shall be added unto you" (<a href="../../par/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). The contents of this verse are followed in the parallel by the words," And Solomon awoke; and behold it was a dream." There can be no doubt that what is here rehearsed did not lose any force or anything of reality from its transpiring in a dream, of which the abundantly open statement of the method of it, as in "sleep," and in "a dream," may be accepted as the first cogent evidence. But beside this, the frequent recital in the Old Testament of occasions when significant and weighty matters of business import were so conducted by the Divine will forms ample ground and defence for the other class of occasions, of which more spiritual matter was the subject (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/41-7.htm">Genesis 41:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/20-3.htm">Genesis 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-10.htm">Genesis 31:10, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/40-5.htm">Genesis 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/41-32.htm">Genesis 41:32</a>; Judges . 7:15; <a href="../../par/job/33-15.htm">Job 33:15</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/1-20.htm">Matthew 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-19.htm">Matthew 27:19</a>). On the other hand, side by side with such passages are those that refer to dreams for their emptiness and transiency of impression, when similes of this kind of thing are required (<a href="../../par/job/20-8.htm">Job 20:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/73-20.htm">Psalm 73:20</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1</a>). This is not the place to enter into any argument of a metaphysical or physiological character respecting dreams, and what they may or may not avail. But as some persons know even too well how dreams have brought them most vivid, most torturing, and most exquisite experiences in turn, there will seem, to them at least, the less difficulty in admitting utterly their availableness for communications of highest import, not only from God to man, but under certain conditions from man to God. Without doubt, certain disabilities (and those, perhaps, more especially of the moral kind) attach to our mind in dreams. But do not dreams also find the scene of the keener activities of mind pure? Granted that the mind is then under ordinary circumstances without a certain control and self-commanding power, yet is it also in some large respects much more at liberty from that besetting tyranny of sense with which waking hours are so familiar! Hence its consummate daring and swiftness and versatility in dream beyond all that it knows in the body's waking state.

It is found above thirty times in Exodus, and fully as often in Leviticus and Numbers. Afterwards it is sprinkled more rarely in the historical books. The reason of its being styled "the tabernacle of the <span class="accented">congregation"</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>) is doubtful - perhaps because of the gatherings of the people in front of it, or possibly because of its being the place where God would meet with Moses. The other name, the tabernacle of "witness" or "testimony" or covenant" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>; <a href="../../par/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15</a>, etc.), is not unfrequent.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-14.htm">2 Chronicles 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-17.</span> - The <span class="accented">attraction to Jerusalem of the signs of wealth - chariots, horses, etc. - on the part of Solomon.</span> The excitement attending the great sacrifices at Gibeon, and before the ark in Jerusalem, had now subsided. And we obtain just a glimpse of the range of thought and purpose present to the mind of the reigning king. The largo expenditure of money would infer without fail the show of brilliant prosperity in the grand city for the time. Whether this would last, and whether it would not infer oppressive taxation somewhere or other (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15, 21, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>) among the people, time would show. Had this expenditure been all to record, none could suppose the commencing of the practical part of the king's reign either sound or auspicious. But, of course, it is to be qualified by other things that were transpiring, with which the parallel acquaints us (e.g. <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>), only in different order. We now, however, begin a rapid and self-contained sketch of the reign of Solomon to his very death (ch. 9.) - the sketch one of marked characteristics, and in consistent keeping with the presumable objects of this work. For it is very much monopolized by the account of the temple. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - The contents of this and the following three verses are identical with the parrallel <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26-29</a>, except that the words, "and gold," of our ver. 15 (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-20.htm">2 Chronicles 9:20</a>) are not found there. The position of these four verses in the parallel, towards the close of the account of Solomon, would seem more natural than their position here, which has somewhat the appearance of a fragment interpolated, as on the other hand the account of the harlot-mothers there. <span class="cmt_word">Solomon gathered chariots and</span> <span class="cmt_word">horsemen.</span> The chariot was no institution of Israel (so <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>), neither of their earliest ancestors, nor of those more proximate. The earliest occasions of the mention of it (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/46-29.htm">Genesis 46:29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-9.htm">Genesis 50:9</a>) are in connection with Egypt, and almost all subsequent occasions for a long stretch of time show it in connection with some foreign nation, till we read (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>) of David "reserving horses" unhoughed "for a hundred chariots," apparently also "reserved" out of the very much larger number which he had taken in battle from Hadadezer King of Zobah. The very genius of the character of God's people, a <span class="accented">pilgrim</span>-genius, as well as their long-time pilgrim<span class="accented">-life</span>, quite accounts for the "chariot," though it be a war-chariot, having never ranked among their treasures (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>). Now, however, Solomon thinks it the time to make it a feature of the nation's power and splendour. He gives the large order for fourteen hundred chariots apparently to Egypt (ver. 17; also ch. 9:28), the appropriate number of horses to which would be probably four thousand (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-25.htm">2 Chronicles 9:25</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-26.htm">1 Kings 4:26</a>, where note the corrupt numeral forty thousand, 10:26). Solomon's fourteen hundred chariots were probably intended to exceed the numbers of the Egyptian king (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-3.htm">2 Chronicles 12:3</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-6.htm">2 Chronicles 14:6</a>), of Hadadezer's (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>), and of the Syrians (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-18.htm">2 Samuel 10:18</a>). But, on the other hand, see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>, unless, as seems very probable, the numerals in these places are again incorrect. Dr. Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible' contains an interesting article on the chariot (vol. 1:295). For significant allusions to the <span class="accented">horsemen</span>, reference may be made to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-20.htm">1 Kings 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-12.htm">2 Kings 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/21-7.htm">Isaiah 21:7</a><span class="cmt_word">.

The chariot cities. In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5, 6</a> we are expressly told that Solomon "built" purposely these cities, for the chariots and for the horsemen, just as he built the "store" cities (see also <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-17.htm">1 Kings 9:17-19</a>; Xenoph., 'Anab.,' 1:4. &sect; 10).

"The wilderness Jezreel was without doubt the name of a part of the great stretch of fiat country bounded on the south by the Waddy El Ghar, and extending from the Dead Sea to the neighbourhood of Tekoa, which is now called <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Hassasah</span>, after a waddy on its northern side.

Our present ascent of Ziz, or Hazziz, has perhaps remained in the Waddy El Hassasah Robinson takes it to be the pass, which at present leads from Ain-jiddy to the table-land. Yet it is described by him as a 'fearful pass,' and it can hardly be thought of here even if the enemy like the Bedouins, now when on their forays, may be supposed to have marched along the shore of the sea, and ascended to the tableland only at Engedi; for the Israelites did not meet the enemy in this ascent, but <span class="accented">above</span> upon the table-land."

The historical episode of these three verses (35-37) is evidently misplaced.

To understand the questions set in motion by the last clause of the verse, comparison must be made of <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-1.htm">2 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-16.htm">2 Kings 8:16</a>. For anything that appears here, we should take for granted that Jehoram now first began to exercise any royal authority and enjoy any royal dignity. But the first of the just-quoted passages says Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded his wicked brother Ahaziah in the <span class="accented">second year</span> of Jehoram (of Judah), son of Jehoshaphat. In the second of the above-quoted passages, however, we are told that the same Jehoram (of Israel) succeeded to the throne in the <span class="accented">eighteenth</span> year of Jehoshaphat, which date tallies with our parallel of last chapter (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-41.htm">1 Kings 22:41</a>), to the effect that Jehoshaphat himself began to reign in Ahab's fourth year, and Ahaziah in Jeho-saphat's seventeenth year. While, lastly, the third of the above-quoted references says that in the fifth year of Joram (of Israel), "Jehoshaphat being then King of Judah" (which, however, is itself an unfaithful rendering of what must be a corrupt text), his son Jehoram "began to reign." It has therefore been conjectured that the royal name was given Jehoram (of Judah) by his father in his father's sixteenth year, and that in his twenty-third year he further invested him with some royal power (our ver. 3 gives some plausibility to this conjecture), from which last date Jehoram's "eight years" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-17.htm">2 Kings 8:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-5.htm">2 Chronicles 21:5, 20</a>) must be reckoned; this was not less than two years before the death of Jehoshaphat. Were it not for the countenance that our third verse (describing the cut-and-dried arrangements that the father made for his sons) gives to the tenableness of the above conjectures, we should prefer the conjecture that the passages commented upon are so much corrupt text.

Nothing is known of the previous history of these six, now so cruelly murdered by their eldest brother. It will be observed that Jehoshaphat is styled King of Israel, probably merely generically.

Jehoshaphat, nevertheless, was but following in the wake of the head of the separated kingdom of Judah, Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-22.htm">2 Chronicles 11:22, 23</a>), wherein he is said to have "dealt wisely;" even the parallel (in the matter of one son Abijah, sen of Maachah, the favourite wife, being appointed king) obtaining there in an aggravated form, as he was not the eldest son. This case, with those of Solomon and Jehoahaz (by the favour not of the parent but of the people, <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>), formed the exceptions to the usual observance of and honour done to the principle of primogeniture (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>).

Of any such place nothing is known, and it has been proposed to supersede the word there by "Self," which a certain amount of similarity of the Hebrew characters might countenance. Possibly by some mishap, not so readily explainable by misoccurrence of characters simply, our words, "with his princes," should stand in place of "to Zair." It must be noted that the two first clauses of the verse in the parallel become something inconsequential (which is not the case with the reading of our text), in that it says, "The king and chariots went forth to a place, and rose up by night," etc. The dislocation is, perhaps, not serious, but our text avoids it in reading, "The king, princes, and chariots went forth, and rose up by night and smote," etc.

This noun does not occur very frequently, but is found in the following passages, viz.: <a href="../../par/exodus/32-16.htm">Exodus 32:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-30.htm">Exodus 39:30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-4.htm">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-4.htm">2 Chronicles 35:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-22.htm">2 Chronicles 36:22</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/1-1.htm">Ezra 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/38-8.htm">Isaiah 38:8</a>. A note in Grove's interesting article, "Elijah" (Smith's 'Bible Dictionary' vol. 1. p. 580), says that the word is almost identical with the Arabic word of the present day, while the ordinary Hebrew word for a "letter" is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span> oftener rendered "book." <span class="cmt_word">There came</span>. That this is the precise language used rather helps the persuasion that it was the well-known Prophet Elijah of Israel, who, not resident in Judah, and perhaps very near the end of his life, and in sight of his translation, was taught and directed divinely to send this message of rebuke and terror for Jehoram. <span class="cmt_word">Elijah</span> <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> Some hold that it certainly was not the well-known prophet of the northern kingdom who is here intended. "Time, place, and circumstance," says Professor Dr. James G. Murphy, of Belfast ('Handbook to the Books of Chronicles,' p. 127), difference him "from the Tishbite." And he confidently considers him (with Cajetan) another Elijah (<a href="../../par/ezra/10-21.htm">Ezra 10:21</a>), or Eliah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-27.htm">1 Chronicles 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-26.htm">Ezra 10:26</a>; for the form rendered so), or Eliyahu, in which form the Hebrew name appears (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;</span>, being the forms of the name found), on the grounds that the Tishbite was translated in the time of Jehoram's father Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>); that his sphere was in the northern kingdom, and himself more of one who wrought mighty works and spoke <span class="accented">otherwise</span> than as a prophet; and that the designation "the prophet" need by no means denote him exclusively. He adds that a "writing" from a prophet is nothing strange, which may be easily conceded but poorly instanced by <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>; better by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-1.htm">Jeremiah 36:1, 2, 6</a>. On the other hand, Grove (in article above quoted) and others find no invincible difficulty in accepting this Elijah for the famous prophet. His mention here is, of course, exceedingly interesting. as the only mention of him in Chro-nicles - a fact which very remarkably falls in with the abstinence as well as the fulness of the compiler of Chronicles. Josephus pronounces that the letter was sent during Elijah's life ('Ant.,' 9:05. &sect; 2), surmises to the contrary having been made. While Elijah's translation seems to have taken place before Jehoshaphat's death, from what we read of <span class="accented">Elisha</span> (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a>), we may well account that Elisha had begun his <span class="accented">ministry before</span> his master's translation. Not only the ether passages that confirm, but in especial the passage (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>) which tells of Jehoram's being, before his father's death, on the throne of Judah at the time of Elijah's interview with Ahaziah (a passage that occurs immediately preceding the account of Elijah's last acts), might have led us to suppose that Elijah's letter was before Jehoshaphat's death, during the joint reign, but for the mention of the slaying of his sons. Bertheau, in our text in his 'Chronik,' points out the resemblance which the "writing" shows to the matter of the speeches of Elijah, while in certain respects of style, and the very insulated sort of introduction it has here, it greatly differs from the narrative in which it is now set. Although the calculation may seem rather a fine one, the circumstances described accurately point to the "writing" of Elijah reaching Jehoram before the chronologically misplaced translation of Elijah as given in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-11</a>. This question may be instanced as one of the interesting moot points by no means compassed with insuperable difficulty, but challenging careful study and patient comparison of chronological and historical passages.

The verse, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, corrects the italics of <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>; expunging them throws their proper force into the words, "at the going up to Gur," showing that Jehu reckoned on that steep kill to enable his pursuing warriors to overtake Ahaziah; makes a sufficiently possible harmony, to say the least, in respect of the remaining incidents narrated of his life - that he made for the time a successful flight to Megiddo, afterwards sought to hide in deeper retirement in Samaria, was thence brought to Jehu at Megiddo, there eventually slain before his eyes, and by his own servants, who must be supposed to have had some attachment to him, but probably with the sanction of Jehu himself, conveyed "in a chariot to Jerusalem" for sepulture "in the sepulchre of his fathers in the city of David" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-28.htm">2 Kings 9:28</a>). The fact that he received decent burial being due to the God-fearing character of his grandfather, and that this should find its record on the page of the book that will last while the world lasts, that very page already two thousand five hundred years old, is a most touching consideration. Megiddo was on the Esdraelon or Jezreel plain, that stretched between the hills of Galilee and those of Mount Ephraim or Samaria. <span class="cmt_word">Had no power to keep still the kingdom</span>. The undoubted meaning of this clause is that there was no one of the house of Ahaziah who could succeed him. The Hebrew text does not say, "no one left," etc. But the allusion can scarcely be to anything but the fact that transpires in our ver. 11 (where only Joash is mentioned as a son, and with him a nurse), viz. that his only surviving son was an infant, The king's sons (presumably sons of Ahaziah and grandsons of her own) were among the "seed royal," whom the wicked Athaliah had "destroyed." Gesenius says that the words that wrap in them the slight ambiguity, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>, are a phrase peculiar to the later Hebrew, and he instances nine examples, all of which come from Daniel or Chronicles, the virtue of the phrase amounting to the <span class="accented">ports ease</span> of the Latin.

We are here told, what is not mentioned in the parallel, that Jehosheba was "wife of Jehoiada the priest," probably the high priest.

The five detachments probably summed up a force of nominally five hundred. It is interesting to note how often high religious enterprises have been due to the trusting mutual co-operation of very few to begin with, and them awakened and led by one. Of no one of these five named here is anything known more to his honour than this - that his name is here recorded. It is said with the most perfect simplicity of even Hebrew language, that <span class="cmt_word">he took them with him in covenant.</span>

The sacredness of the phrase made it dear, above the narrowness of the distinctive appellation <span class="accented">Judah</span>, though the worthies all were gathered, as just;implied, out of "Judah."

This was the second wider and more embracing covenant. <span class="accented">This</span> covenant is between all the gathered representatives and the young king, Jehoiada no doubt putting all things into shape. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign</span>. The <span class="accented">he</span> is Jehoiada, as of course. In view of the last clause of ver. 4 - in the parallel, "<span class="accented">Jehoiada showed</span> them the king's son " - the likelier rendering of our text here is, <span class="accented">Behold the king's son</span>; <span class="accented">he shall reign, as</span>, etc<span class="cmt_word">. As the Lord hath said of the sons of David</span> (see <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-16.htm">2 Chronicles 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-18.htm">2 Chronicles 7:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-4.htm">1 Kings 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-5.htm">1 Kings 9:5</a>). The hereditary nature of the monarchy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>.), pervaded ever by the spirit of the covenant, is evidently glanced at. It is probable that the existence of Joash was news to those to whom Jehoiada, as the parallel has it, "showed...  the king's son," so that double significance lies in the word "showed." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, <i>shall be</i> porters of the doors;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - The first thing that is to be observed is the distinct and repeated mention of the <span class="accented">Levites</span>, as those on whom the critical and onerous service that came of Jehoiada's resolution was devolved, while the parallel does not so much as mention them. It may next be noted that our first and second verses state the part that "the captains of hundreds" were called to perform in <span class="accented">collecting</span> the requisite number of Levites from the provincial cities of Judah. And once more it may be noted that whereas, while we abide close by our own text alone, nothing in the description of our vers. 4-10 occasions material difficulty, even when the perplexity, which is considerable, does enter, on consulting and endeavouring to reconcile the parallel, it is with extreme probability due to our not making sufficient allowance for the fact that the matter of the two accounts does not so much offer itself for reconciliation as for concurrent acceptance. We have now to follow the description of our own text. <span class="cmt_word">Of you entering on the sabbath</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of you who enter on your period of duty on such a sabbath. See ver. 8, the "men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath." This alludes, as the next clause definitely says, to the weekly courses of the Levites, as described in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-25.htm">1 Chronicles 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25.htm">1 Chronicles 25</a>. - the incoming and outgoing companies. <span class="cmt_word">Porters of the doors;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "keepers of the doors of the temple" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-19.htm">1 Chronicles 9:19</a>). This may correspond with the middle clause of ver. 6 in the parallel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">And a third part <i>shall be</i> at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people <i>shall be</i> in the courts of the house of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A third part... at the king's house</span>. It seems impossible to refer this to the royal palace, as some suppose from ver. 19 in the parallel. It probably designates the place where the child had been living in concealment. This portion of the description appears to correspond with the last clause of ver. 5 in the parallel. <span class="cmt_word">At the gate of the foundation</span>. The Hebrew text here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13</a>); in the parallel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, a name only found there, and unintelligible - probably a corruption of the other word. The gate of the foundation is supposed to have stood at that corner of the area which was strengthened by additional works, where was the ravine separating Moriah and the hill to the south. <span class="cmt_word">All the</span> <span class="cmt_word">people.</span> Evidently the miscellaneous outside people are not here intended, who were not entrusted with the secret and the surprise that was to be, but the same <span class="accented">all the people</span> as are unmistakably designated in ver. 10; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all who were appointed to officiate. The last clause in each of vers. 5, 6, 7 in the parallel go strongly to confirm the position that" the king's house "so far does not intend the royal palace, but such part of <span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">house of the Lord</span> as had been, and then still was, "about the king" (ver. 7, parallel); in order to keep watch "about the king,' they were set to keep watch of a certain part of "the house of the Lord." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they <i>are</i> holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But let</span> <span class="cmt_word">none come... save the priests</span>. Through this little chink we get some light confirmatory of the concurrent jurisdiction of the account in the parallel The express caution of this clause shows that there were others about, and others officiating, beside the Levites, who only have been mentioned hitherto in our text, except under the most generic designation (as before, so again in last clause of this verse) of "all the people." The last clause of this verse may cover the contents of ver. 7 in the parallel. The distinction between "the courts of the house of the Lord" (ver. 5), and "the house of the Lord" (ver. 6) is, of course, quite apparent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-7.htm">2 Chronicles 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever <i>else</i> cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Levites shall compass the king</span>. The matter of ver. 8 in the parallel suggests nothing inconsistent with the express mention of the Levites here, but rather that the word "Levites" is desiderated there, and its significance perhaps accidentally overlooked, when the writer of Kings was using the original authorities and sources of his history. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-8.htm">2 Chronicles 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go <i>out</i> on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All Judah</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those of Judah's provincial cities who had been honoured with summons to join in this great and solemn enterprise. <span class="cmt_word">Dismissed not the courses</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the provincial Levites cooperated with the regulars of Jerusalem.

The parallel (ver. 11) summarizes them under the name <span class="accented">the guard.</span> It may be just noted, in passing, that, while the Hebrew text has in both places "shoulder," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the "side" of this verse, and the "corner" of the parallel, the Revised Version has harmonized the rendering, electing the rendering <span class="accented">side. <span class="cmt_word"></span>From the right side of the temple to the left side.</span> This is equivalent to saying, those composing the guard were placed on the south and north sides. <span class="cmt_word">Along by the altar</span>.

The parallel (ver. 12) has, "he brought out," etc. The last clause of our verse harmonizes even this simple point, indicating that the "they" designates "Jehoiada and his sons;" of which group Jehoiada himself was, of course, the greatest part. It will be noted that it is not said from what exact place Joash was brought out. <span class="cmt_word">Put</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon him the crown and...</span> the testimony.

Our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a> leaves it probable that "Jehoaden of Jerusalem" was one of these, though it is likely enough that Joash married, whether her or some one else, <span class="accented">before</span> he had reached the age of twenty-one.

The command given here to the priests and Levites is expressed very differently, though in no degree contadictorily, in the parallel (see its vers. 4, 5). The addition is there found, "every man of his acquaintance;" this expression may glance at the very supposable circumstance that the priest and Levite collecting deputations would naturally go respectively to the towns and cities where they had been located beforetime. A slight ambiguity is perhaps occasioned by the impression that the fourth verse (in the parallel) produces - that the priests and Levites should wait to <span class="accented">receive, e.g.</span>, in Jerusalem. This, however, is sot what is <span class="accented">said</span>, and need not, therefore, be made into a difficulty. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the Levites hastened not.</span> We are not told <span class="accented">why</span> this delay was, nor does the subsequent narrative seem to elucidate it, further than this - that the delay somehow seemed to rest with Jehoiada, as the king appealed to him for explanation.

Revised Version "chief" in all the instances. The name "priest" occurs just about six hundred and sixty-six times in the Old Testament, the title "high" or "chief priest" only about twenty-six times, the first occurrence being in <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-10.htm">Leviticus 21:10</a>, the last <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-11.htm">Zechariah 6:11</a>; and both set forth by the Hebrew adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, as also in fifteen other of the occurrences.

In these last two cases, however (<a href="../../par/ezra/8-24.htm">Ezra 8:24, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/10-5.htm">Ezra 10:5</a>), it is not "high priests" nor "chief priests" that are perhaps even really intended, but the "princes" of the priests, or those who, for whatever reasons of personal characteristics, were <span class="accented">chief. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Out of Judah and out of Jerusalem</span>.

This source of money for the holy design of Joash is again most specifically stated in our ver. 9. The version of this whole transaction seems rather confusing as given in the parallel, where ver. 4 mentions three sources of money, without any quotation as such of the ordained tax of Moses, which was apparently the first of those three, and where ver. 8, at first blush at any rate, might seem to imply <span class="accented">recusant</span> priests. The meaning, however, is probably the contrary, the verse purporting that the priests consented to forego what they had been accustomed on receiving to apply to some personal or current-funds purpose, and who consented to forego the superintending of the outlay of the money on. the repairing, that it might be done with more expedition by "scribe" and high priest" (ver. 10; comp. ver. 16; both of the parallel). All these details the writer of Chronicles passes over, only pursuing the essential business, Joash's pious resolve, the delay in its execution, and how he finally overcame the obstructive delay.

The insertion of the italic type in the Authorized Version "withal" unnecessarily helps suggest uncertainty in this rendering, while the Revised Version gives that word in the ordinary type; margin, both Authorized Version and Revised Version, gives "pestles." The Hebrew word is (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>) the hiph. turin, of the familiar verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or plural of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> with article prefixed; this word, however, seems to occur only once (<a href="../../par/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>), and then in the singular number. <span class="cmt_word">The rest</span> of <span class="cmt_word">the money...  made vessels for</span> <span class="cmt_word">the house of</span> <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>.

This good man, husband of Jehoram's daughter (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/22-11.htm">2 Chronicles 22:11</a>), only comes to view in virtue of what his wife did, and what he did,; on behalf of Joash the infant and Joash the king for the good of the nation or kingdom of Judah. We seem to know too little of him, and the parallel supplies considerably less than our text in Chronicles. His age, as stated in this verse when he died, seems very improbable, and for a very clear and admirable putting of the case, see Lord Arthur C. Hervey's article in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:944. There is, however, no manifest or even suspicious symptom of corruptness in the text just here, supported as it is by the Septuagint and Josephus, by the stress laid on his old age, whether it showed a hundred and thirty years, or thirty years or fifty years (as have been variously suggested) fewer; the little fact, otherwise looking very significant, that the expression, <span class="cmt_word">full of days</span>, is used beside only of Abraham, Isaac, Job, and <span class="accented">David</span>, loses its pertinence in that very circumstance that it <span class="accented">is</span> used of David, whose age was in no way extreme. The age of the other three, however, exceeded this reputed age given to Jehoiada! 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-16.htm">2 Chronicles 24:16</a></div><div class="verse">And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - The honour done Jehoiada well belonged to him, not only for his goodness, his greatness, his practical services to the kingdom, but for the fact that those practical services had entailed the necessity of his standing <span class="accented">in loco regis</span> for some time. His royal alliance with Jeheram's daughter, and, if it were so, his extreme patriarchal age, may all have contributed to the honour now put upon him. Little stress can be laid, however, upon this last consideration, failing any other allusion to it, or any emphasized statement of what we have in our ver. 15. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-17.htm">2 Chronicles 24:17</a></div><div class="verse">Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king.

This is the word that is used of the sheaves of the brethren of Joseph bowing down, according to his dream, to his sheaf; it is also the repeatedly used word of the worship paid to Jehovah the true God, and to idols and false gods. The word occurs nearly two hundred times. The <span class="accented">obeisance</span> of these princes, therefore, on this occasion lacked nothing of the most pronounced character, and the worst species of flattery gained its disastrous ends. Joash must have been now about thirty-six years of age; he was seven years old when he began to reign, he had reigned twenty-three years before the restoring of the temple (<a href="../../par/2_kings/12-6.htm">2 Kings 12:6</a>), and a few years had elapsed since. The words of the princes, to which Joash <span class="cmt_word">hearkened</span>, are not supplied by the parallel, which indeed at once proceeds to speak of the threatening attitude of the Syrian king Hazael, and of how Joash bought him off. Our next verse, however, shows to what end those words tended.

Comparing the emphatic language of ver. 23," destroyed all the princes of the people <span class="accented">from among the people</span>," we may conclude that stress is to be laid on the pronoun "their" in the present verse. The worship of the true God was not left by the whole people, and we are not told it was by the king; but (very probably through want of moral courage) he incurred the severest sort of blame, and was without even the excuse of strong personal temptation.

Reading these two clauses in the preterite or present tense will make them neither less forcible nor less correct, so indicating that they, the princes and the nation, were already beginning to eat the fruit of their ways, and "rumours of war," if not war itself, were on them.

So, too, the Revised Version, which also, according to its custom, removes the italic type from the two neuter pronouns "it." But probabaly a better and correcter rendering is, "The Lord will see and will require" (for it is not necessary to regard  this as a prayer of Zechariah); and thus bring it into comparison with those divinest prayers of the Saviour and of St. Stephen. The words on dying Zechariah's lips were perhaps rather the vivid reminiscence of his own well-versed knowledge of the Law, or "the Scriptures" (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-22.htm">Genesis 42:22</a>). The sentence of the dying priest and prophet in one, is, by the writer of Chronicles at any rate, directed in its fall with fearful straightness to the door of <span class="cmt_word">Joash the king</span> himself. Remarkable as is the absence of the matter of this and the five preceding verses from the parallel, it will not escape notice how it is implied in vers. 17,18 there, while the <span class="accented">inclusion</span> of it here is again in patent harmony with the great object of the writer.

Whether intended so here or not, probably the strict subject of the verb in this clause is Joash and his counsellors (ver. 18 in parallel), in their fright - and just fright - helpless after the slaughter chronicled in our following verse, bribing off Hazael and his host, as in parallel. The suggestion is most plausible that tidings of Zechariah's martyrdom and of the occasion of it were the very incentive to Hazael's incursion, and an illustration of the "means" by which God works, and by which he wrought his purpose in this instance. <span class="cmt_word">The spoil of them</span>. If this means only the spoil of the defeated army strictly, then our text gives no trace of the contents of ver. 18 in parallel just alluded to; but the frequent dislocation incident to copied extracts and matter borrowed from original sources, and so often evidenced in the present history, when we have been comparing the two derived accounts to which we are indebted for it, incline us to the above view, as one quite open at any rate to possibility.

The sons of Jehoiada. We know of only one son, Zechariah; there may have been other sons, or other lineal relations of Jehoiada may be covered by the word "sons." We are not obliged to interpret the avenging act of the servants as one to which their own pious and patriotic zeal led them, which, considering their maternal pedigree, is perhaps something unlikely, though of course not impossible, but one to which they were incited by the retributive providence of him who held their hearts also in his hand.

It is rabbinic literature mostly that has determined the preference for the word "commentary." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_chronicles/25.htm"><title>2 Chronicles 25 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_chronicles/25.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_chronicles/25.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_chronicles/25-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_chronicles/24.htm" title="2 Chronicles 24">&#9668;</a> 2 Chronicles 25 <a href="../2_chronicles/26.htm" title="2 Chronicles 26">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-1.htm">2 Chronicles 25:1</a></div><div class="verse">Amaziah <i>was</i> twenty and five years old <i>when</i> he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem.

This affix to the mother's name may perhaps carry credit to the memory of Jehoiada, for having been careful to select a woman of the honoured city rather than of any provincial or even less worthy city.

This is illustrated by his coming "to set up the gods of Edom" (vers. 14-16, 20); also by what the parallel supplies, that he resembled Joash rather than David, and did not suppress "the high places, sacrifices, and in-cense-burning" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-3.htm">2 Kings 14:3, 4</a>). In almost all cases, the <span class="accented">not perfect</span> heart speaks of that which <span class="accented">began</span> well, but did not "endure unto the end."

This is kal conjugation of the verb, which we found in piel in ver. 5 of foregoing chapter, and there rendered "repair." The kal force of the word is simply to "be strong" (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-57.htm">Genesis 41:57</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-5.htm">2 Kings 14:5</a>). The hiph., to "make strong," or "confirm," as it is rendered here, is found in <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>. Again and again the disorders of the kingdom and the violent deaths of prophets and kings must have greatly contributed to nervous apprehensions, in fact only too just, when a new king ascended the throne. In the parallel and in passage last quoted the words, "in his hand," follow the verb. Amaziah both needed to get his own hand in, according to modern phrase, and to get things well into his hand. <span class="cmt_word">His servants</span>. It may be held surprising that they should have been found "in the <span class="accented">place</span>," or should now be <span class="accented">his servants</span> at all. The explanation may be either that their guilt had not yet been known, or, if <span class="accented">known</span>, had not been fixed upon them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-4.htm">2 Chronicles 25:4</a></div><div class="verse">But he slew not their children, but <i>did</i> as <i>it is</i> written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Slew not their children</span>. Emphasis (the emphasis of <span class="accented">mention</span>, at any rate) is laid upon this, perhaps partly to show that Amaziah did in some measure walk by "the Law of the Lord," and partly because of numerous cases that had grown up to the opposite (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-8.htm">2 Kings 9:8, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>, <span class="accented">where, however, very possibly all were more or less aiders and abettors of the wickedness</span>).

Compare Asa's "five hundred and eighty thousand" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/14-8.htm">2 Chronicles 14:8</a>), and Jehoshaphat's "eleven hundred and sixty thousand" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-14.htm">2 Chronicles 17:14-19</a>; see <span class="accented">note, however, on these verses, and the improbability of numbers so high</span>).

The next verse tells us that "all the children of Ephraim" (which was strictly the northern Israel's chief tribe) are hereby designated. It is not quite clear that this Israel is exactly conterminous with the Israel of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-3.htm">2 Chronicles 13:3</a>, the identity of which, however, with Joab's Israel (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) is very probable. The boundaries of the strict tribe of Ephraim, whose ancestor was Joseph's younger son, are described in <a href="../../par/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>. The tribe were located as nearly as possible in the centre of the land. Ephraim, however, is here, as in many other places, as the name of the royal tribe, so named upon the whole of the northern kingdom (<a href="../../par/isaiah/9-8.htm">Isaiah 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-3.htm">Isaiah 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-3.htm">Isaiah 28:3</a>; <span class="accented">several times in almost every chapter of Hosea, and for a typical instance</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/hosea/14-8.htm">Hosea 14:8</a>).

The drift of the <span class="accented">next</span> verse, which shows Amaziah a convert to the strong exhortation of the man of God, makes either alternative allowable under the present text very untimely. and not very much in accord with what we should look for at the lips of the man of God. The very conceivable way out of the difficulty is to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span>, hyphened to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dd;</span> (all the rather that no <span class="accented">vau</span> is present in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;</span>, as the present text is), and proceed to supply <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span> again before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, crediting some copyist with confusion of eye through these having come close together in his manuscript. The rendering will then be straightforward, and prepare the way for Amaziah's yielding conformably with the tenor of the next verse. "But if not" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> if thou wilt not be guided by my remonstrance as to Ephraim), "go thou, be on the alert, exert all the strength possible for the battle, and yet nevertheless God will cause thee to stumble." And the remaining sentence may bear this significance, "For God hath power to help thee though alone, or to cast thee down though supported by an extra hundred thousand." If such alteration or conjectural restoration of the text be not accepted, we may harmonize the facts of the case with the most utter faithfulness of lip on the part of the prophet, by translating, "For in very truth, if thou go at all, and though thou make the best preparations, God shall make it go ill with thee." And Amaziah is persuaded to <span class="accented">this</span> point, that he will neither risk the lives of them of Ephraim vainly, nor risk the likelier displeasure of God on himself. He yields only partly, and therefore is nothing benefited. The difficulty is left untouched, that the prophet did not simply <span class="accented">in toto</span> forbid Amaziah to go, and that, saving them of Ephraim, he saves them to be a second scourge for the back of Amaziah, though he took his prophet's advice so far, and <span class="accented">lost his</span> own money. A careful and devout observer of human life and perverseness, when once these commit themselves to the vain struggle with God, and equally vain attempt to haggle with his providence as to how much to yield and how much to resist and with. hold, cannot but be struck with the photograph here thrown off, and that it is a faithful one, of hard facts that have met together disastrously times without number in men's lives. The sum, then, of the matter of our vers. 7, 8 may amount to this: "Under no circumstances take Israel, and if thou go thyself with all best preparations, yet know that God shall destroy thee."

It may well be that they asked why they were discharged; and whether the right answer were given them, that the Lord dwelt not among them, or some wrong answer, it evidently did not improve matters, but rankled in their hearts till it found relief (vers. 13, 22), as they concluded that either their ability or fidelity, or both, were called in question. The 'Speaker's Commentary' very aptly cites the keen resentment and mortification that the Athenians are recorded to have felt in similar circumstances as told in Plutarch's 'Lives:' "Cimon," &sect;17. <span class="cmt_word">Separated them.</span> This is the verb occurring several times in the first verses of <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>.

The parallel tells us the interesting fact that Amaziah, perhaps under the influence of a spasmodic touch of devout-hess or gratitude, changed the name of Selah, or rather endeavoured to change it, to Joktheel, which Gesenius translates "subjugated of God." This name had already occurred in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>.

He knows human nature well, and Amaziah's particular variety therein perfectly well. And many would have snapped at the opportunity of humbling such a man. But not so Joash; he enjoys, indeed, the opportunity of satisfying his own sarcasm and patronizingness, but would still spare Amaziah's people and save him from himself.

The composition of the previous two verses dismisses delicately the fact that Joash, ignominiously bringing "Amaziah to Jerusalem" (ver. 23), contemptuously left him there, with a present of his life, though less his honour and much wealth.

The parallel has "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah." Considering the amount and the character of the resemblance that we have noticed between the narratives in Kings and in our own text, and assuming that the work to which each compiler calls attention for the fuller elucidation of his subject of biography is the work which he has himself most largely laid under 'contribution, then we should justly feel in this instance that we had no feeble argument for the identity of the two works, called by rather different titles - by the writer of the pre-Captivity, "the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah," and by him of the post-Captivity, "the book of the kings of Judah and Israel."

This can scarcely mean the child of Ahaz, considering Ahaz's age; some think a brother of the present king, son of Jotham, may be intended. We have also to fall back upon the use of the phrase, "king's son," for some special official of the king or court (see note on 2 Chronicles 18:25; and its parallel, <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-26.htm">1 Kings 22:26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The governor of the house</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">ruler.</span> We have probably a sufficient clue to this designation in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; and the designation itself, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-3.htm">2 Chronicles 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-18.htm">2 Kings 18:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-11.htm">2 Chronicles 19:11</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Next to the king</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>; literally, therefore, <span class="accented">the next of the king</span>, the general meaning of which expression cannot be doubtful (comp. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/10-3.htm">Esther 10:3</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-9.htm">Nehemiah 11:9</a>), but the exacter scope and functions of the person under the kings of the divided kingdom thus designated is less certain.

While the Syrian king carried his captives to Damascus (ver. 5), the Israel king carried his to Samaria.

The growingly frequent references to the interposition of the prophets is much to be noticed, and their dignity, courage, fidelity, are brought into grand relief. They are very typical of the moral presence of which no national history, a.s centuries solemnly flow on, gives the slightest symptom of a slackening need.

To the wonderful life of this figure, that must strike every reader, must be added the force that comes of its moral rather than merely material suggestion - a moral suggestion that reminds us of that of the sentence of far greater antiquity, and from the sacred lip of the Inspirer of all prophets, "The voice of thy brother's blood <span class="accented">crieth unto me</span> from the ground." The rage had not been that on which the sun did <span class="accented">not</span> go down; it had been so fierce that upon it the sun ought never to have been required to look.

The expression of the text, however, "reach-eth," or "toucheth," cannot be understood to reproduce as a perfect equivalent the older above-quoted one of "crieth." In other words, the magnitude of the rage is the first thing set forth, and the particular language in which it is set forth well postulates the inference of its abominableness in God's sight.

Some think (as, for instance, Canon Rawlinson) that they were sin offering, as the account of the offering of them (ver. 22) takes priority for them over the he-goats; others (as Bertheau, Professor J. G. Murphy, etc.), that they were certainly burnt offering. It scarcely appears as though much stress can be laid upon what is apparently the chief reason of Canon Rawlinson's opinion, in face of the immediate language of the last sentence of our ver. 24, "for the king commended the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel." The fact of no mention of burnt offering in our present verse, and of the natural construction of the description, "for a sin offering for the kingdom," etc., as applying to <span class="accented">all</span> that had preceded, seems the better argument, and all that is necessary, unless something moderately decisive be forthcoming to rebut it. The solution of all, however, is probably to our hand in <a href="../../par/ezra/8-35.htm">Ezra 8:35</a>, which is a very close and significant parallel to our present verse.

So the name is spelt, whether of Tyrian king or Tyrian workman, in Chronicles, except, perhaps, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a>.

The Septuagint write the name <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Hiram.</span> The name of Hiram's father was Abibaal. Hiram himself began to reign, according to Menander, when nineteen years of age, reigned thirty-four years (B.C. 1023-990), and died therefore at the age of fifty-three. Of Hiram and his reign in Tyre very little is known beyond what is so familiar to us from the Bible history of David and Solomon. The city of Tyre is among the most ancient. Though it is not mentioned in Homer, yet the Sidonians, who lived in such close connection with the Tyrians, are mentioned there ('Iliad.,' 6:290; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:84; 22:424), whilst Virgil calls Tyre the Sidonian city, Sidon being twenty miles distant ('AEn.,' 1:12, 677; 4:545). The modern name of Tyre is <span class="accented">Sur.</span> The city was situate on the east coast of the Mediterranean, in Phoenicia, about seventy-four geographical miles north of Joppa, while the road distance from Joppa to Jerusalem was thirty-two miles. The first Bible mention of Tyre is in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>. After that the more characteristic mentions of it are <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, with all its parallels; 2 Samuel 24:7; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-2.htm">Ezekiel 26:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-1.htm">Ezekiel 27:1-8</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/9-2.htm">Zechariah 9:2, 3</a>. Tyre was celebrated for its working in copper and brass, and by no means only for its cedar and timber felling. The good terms and intimacy subsisting between Solomon and the King of Tyre speak themselves very plainly in Bible history, without leaving us dependent on doubtful history, or tales of such as Josephus ('Ant.,' 8:05. &sect; 3; 'Contra Apion,' 1:17). For the timber, metals, workmen, given by Hiram to Solomon, Solomon gave to Hiram corn and oil, ceded to him some cities, and the use of some ports on the Red Sea (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-14, 25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21-23</a>.

This sweet incense, compounded of the four ingredients stacte, onycha, galbanum, pure frankincense, was to be burnt morning and evening, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifices on the altar made of shittim wood, overlaid with gold, which stood in the holy place facing the ark. with the table of shewbread on the one hand, and the golden candlestick on the other. While the act of atonement was set forth by the offering of the victim on the brazen altar in the outer court, the ascending, acceptable, and accepted prayer and aspiration of the congregation were expressed by the sweet incense-burning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="cmt_word">The continual</span> <span class="cmt_word">shew-bread</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>). The elementary meaning of the word here rendered "shewbread" is "a ranging in order," whether the "order" might be, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, that of an army in battle array (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-16.htm">1 Samuel 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-8.htm">1 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>), or of the lamps of the holy candlestick (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-37.htm">Exodus 39:37</a>), or of pilings of wood to be burnt on the altar (<a href="../../par/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), or of cakes of bread, as presumably 'here and in some parallel passages (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>). For the table which was to carry these cakes, see <a href="../../par/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23-30</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-10.htm">Exodus 37:10-16</a>; the last verse of the former passage speaking of the shewbread under the name <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. (For the position of the table, see <a href="../../par/exodus/26-35.htm">Exodus 26:35</a>.) The word employed in the text is first used to express the piles of cakes, called in our Authorized Version shewbread in <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6, 7</a>; then <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-32.htm">1 Chronicles 9:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-29.htm">1 Chronicles 23:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-16.htm">1 Chronicles 28:16</a>; as also again in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-11.htm">2 Chronicles 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>; and in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-33.htm">Nehemiah 10:33</a>. Where in these passages the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> is not expressed, that it is understood may be gathered from the other passages (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-7.htm">Numbers 4:7</a>). The bread consisted of twelve large cakes of unleavened dough (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), ranged in two heaps, and with a golden cup of frankincense (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7</a>) to each pile. When on every seventh day new cakes were substituted, the old ones belonged to the priests (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-33.htm">Exodus 29:33, 34</a>). The twelve cakes pointed to the twelve tribes. Their size may be judged from the statement that each cake contained two tenth deals, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two-tenths of an ephah, equal to about six pounds and a quarter. The exact significance of this bread is not stated in Scripture. Part of it lay plainly in the twelve cakes, part, perhaps, in their becoming priest's food, found by the people (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-8.htm">Leviticus 24:8</a>), after having been presented seven days before the Lord. Much that is interesting but not finally satisfactory on the question may be found in the article "Shewbread" in Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1271. Our Authorized Version "shewbread' comes from Luther's <span class="accented">Schaubrode.</span> Wickliffe, after the Vulgate <span class="accented">panes propositionis</span>, designates it "the loaves of proposition." The New Testament has, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-2.htm">Hebrews 9:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; as also in the Gospels (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-4.htm">Matthew 12:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/6-4.htm">Luke 6:4</a>); while the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-30.htm">Exodus 25:30</a>), and <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48</a>).

The morning and evening offering were alike, viz. a lamb, a meal offering consisting of a tenth of an ephah of flour, mixed with the fourth part of a bin of beaten oil, and a drink offering consisting of the fourth part of a bin of "wine," or of "strong drink." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The burnt offering <span class="cmt_word">on the sabbath</span>.

To find a place for <span class="accented">this</span> subject amid his careful selection, and rejection in many cases, of the matter at his command, is certainly a decision in harmony with his general design in this work. Then, again, they may be remarked on as spoken to another king, who, whether it were to be expected or no, was, it is plain, a sympathizing hearer of the piety and religious resolution of Solomon (ver. 12). This is one of the touches of history that does not diminish our regret that we do not know more of Hiram. He was no "proselyte," but he had the sympathy of a convert to the religion of the Jew. Perhaps the simplest and most natural explanation may just be the truest, that Hiram for some long time had seen "the rising" kingdom, and alike in David and Solomon in turn, "the coming" men. He had been more calmly and deliberately impressed than the Queen of Sheba afterwards, but not less effectually and operatively impressed. And once more the passage is noteworthy for the utterances of Solomon in themselves. As parenthetically testifying to a powerful man, who could be a powerful helper of Solomon's enterprise, his outburst of explanation, and of ardent religious purpose, and of humble godly awe, is natural. But that he should call the temple he purposed to build "so great," as we cannot put it down either to intentional exaggeration or to sober historic fact, must the rather be honestly set down to such considerations as these, viz. that in point of fact, neither David nor Solomon were "travelled men," as Joseph and Moses, for instance. Their measures of greatness were largely dependent upon the existing material and furnishing of their own little country. And further, Solomon speaks of the temple as great very probably from the point of view of its simple religious uses (note end of ver. 6) as the place of sacrifice in especial rather than as a place, for instance, of vast congregations and vast processions. Then, too, as compared with the tabernacle, it would loom "great," whether for size or for its enduring material. Meantime, though Solomon does indeed use the words (ver. 5)," The house.., is great," yet, throwing on the words the light of the remaining clause of the verse, and of David's words in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, it is not very certain that the main thing present to his mind was <span class="accented">not</span> the size, but rather the <span class="accented">character</span> of the house, and the solemn character of the <span class="accented">enterprise</span> itself (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-18.htm">2 Chronicles 6:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who am I...  save only to burn sacrifice before him?</span> The drift of Solomon's thought is plain - that nothing would justify mortal man, if he purported to build really a palace of residence for him whom the heaven of heavens could not contain, but that he is justified all the more in "not giving sleep to his eyes, nor slumber to his eyelids, until he had found out a place" (<a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4, 5</a>) where man might acceptably, in God's <span class="accented">appointed way</span>, draw near to him. If "earth draw near to heaven," it may be confidently depended on that heaven will not be slow to bend down its glory, majesty, grace, to earth.

By comparison of ver. 3, it appears that Solomon makes of Hiram's services to David his father a very plea why his own requests addressed now to Hiram should be granted. If we may be guided by the <span class="accented">form</span> of the expressions used in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-1.htm">1 Chronicles 14:1</a> and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11, 12</a>, Hiram had in the first instance volunteered help to David, and had not waited to be applied to by David. This would show us more clearly the force of Solomon's plea. Further, if we note the language of <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>, we may be disposed to think that it fills a gap in our present connection, and indicates that, though Solomon appears here to have had to take the initiative, an easy opportunity was opened, in the courteous embassy sent him in the persons of Hiram's "servants." That the king of this most privileged, separate, and exclusive people of Israel (and <span class="accented">he</span> the one who conducted that people to the very zenith of their fame) should have to apply and be permitted to apply to foreign and, so to say, heathen help, in so intrinsic a matter as the finding of the "cunning" and the "skill" of head and hand for the most sacred and distinctive <span class="accented">chef d'oeuvre</span> of the said exclusive nation, is a grand instance of nature breaking all trammels, even when most divinely purposed, and a grand token of the dawning comity of nations, of free-trade under the unlikeliest auspices, and of the brotherhood of humanity, never more broadly illustrated than when on an international scale. The competence of the Phoenicians and the people of Sidon and those over whom Hiram immediately reigned in the working of the metals, and furthermore in a very wide range of other subjects, is well sustained by the allusions of very various authorities (already instanced under 1 Chronicles 14:1, and <span class="accented">passim</span>; Homer, 'Iliad,' 6:289-294; 23. 743; 'Odys.,' 4:614; 15:415-426; Herod., 3:19; 7:23, 44, 96; Strabo, 16:2. &sect; 23). The man who was sent is described in vers. 13, 14, <span class="accented">infra</span>, as also <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-13.htm">1 Kings 7:13, 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Purple, ... crimson, ... blue</span>. It is not absolutely necessary to suppose that the same Hiram, so skilled in working of gold, silver, brass, and iron, was <span class="accented">the</span> authority sent for these matters of various coloured dyes for the cloths that would later on be required for curtains and other similar purposes in the temple. So far, indeed, as the literal construction of the words go, this would seem to be what is meant, and no doubt <span class="accented">may</span> have been the case, though unlikely. The <span class="accented">purple</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). A Chaldee form of this word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) occurs three times in <a href="../../par/daniel/5-7.htm">Daniel 5:7, 16, 29</a>, and appears in each of those cases in our Authorized Version as "scarlet." Neither of these words is the word used in the numerous passages of Exodus, Numbers, Judges, Esther, Proverbs, Canticles, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, nor, indeed, in ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. In all these places, numbering nearly forty, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>. The purple was probably obtained from some shell-fish on the coast of the Mediterranean. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). Gesenius says that this was a colour obtained from multitudinous insects that tenanted one kind of the flex (<span class="accented">Coccus ilicis</span>), and that the word is from the Persian language. The Persian <span class="accented">kerm</span>, Sanscrit <span class="accented">krimi</span>, Armenian <span class="accented">karmir</span>, German <span class="accented">carmesin</span>, and our own "crimson," keep the same framework of letters or sound to a remarkable degree. This word is found only here, ver. 13, <span class="accented">infra</span>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>. The <span class="accented">crimson</span> of <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-30.htm">Jeremiah 4:30</a>, and the <span class="accented">scarlet</span> of some forty places in the Pentateuch and other books, come as the rendering of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The <span class="accented">blue</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>). This is the same word as is used in some fifty other passages in Exodus, Numbers, and in later books. This colour was obtained from a shell-fish (<span class="accented">Helix ianthina</span>) found in the Mediterranean, the shell of which was blue. <span class="cmt_word">Can skill to grave</span>. The word "to grave" is the piel conjugation of the very familiar Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>, "to open." Out of twenty-nine times that the verb occurs in some part of the piel conjugation, it is translated "grave" nine times, "loosed" eleven times, "put off" twice, "ungirded" once, "opened" four times, "appear" once, and "go free" once. Perhaps the "opening" the ground with the plough (<a href="../../par/isaiah/28-24.htm">Isaiah 28:24</a>) leads most easily on to the idea of "engraving." <span class="cmt_word">Cunning men whom...

If they were accessible in Lebanon, it is not on the face of it to be supposed they would be ordered from such a distance as Ophir. Lastly, there is very great difference of opinion as to what the tree was in itself. In Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. 3. appendix, p. 6, the subject is discussed more fully than it can be here, and with some of its scientific technicalities. Celsius has mentioned fifteen woods for which the honour has been claimed. More modern disputants have suggested five, of these the red sandalwood being considered, perhaps, the likeliest. So great an authority as Dr. Hooker pronounces that it is a question quite undetermined. But inasmuch as it is so undetermined, it would seem possible that, if it were a precious wood of the smaller kind (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ebony with us), and, so to say, of shy growth in Lebanon, it might be that it did grow in Lebanon, but that a very insufficient supply of it there was customarily supplemented by the imports received from Ophir. Or, again, it may be that the words, "out of Lebanon," are simply misplaced (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>), and should follow the words, "fir trees." The rendering "pillars" in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a> for "rails" or "props" is unfortunate, as the other quoted uses of the wood for "harps" and "psalteries" would all betoken a <span class="accented">small</span> as well as very hard wood. Lastly, it is a suggestion of Canon Rawlinson that, inasmuch as the almug wood of Ophir came <span class="accented">via</span> Phoenicia and Hiram, Solomon may very possibly have been ignorant that "Lebanon" was not its proper <span class="accented">habitat. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thy servants can skill to cut timber</span>. This same testimony is expressed yet more strongly in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>, "There is not any among us that can skill to hew timber like the Sidoniaus." Passages like <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-23.htm">2 Kings 19:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>, go to show that the verb employed in our text is rightly rendered "hew," as referring to the <span class="accented">felling</span> rather than to any subsequent dressing and sawing up of the timber. It is, therefore, rather more a point of interest to learn in <span class="accented">what</span> the great skill consisted which so threw Israelites into the shade, while distinguishing Hiram's servants. It is, of course<span class="cmt_word">,</span> quite possible that the "hewing," or "felling," may be taken to <span class="accented">infer</span> all the subsequent cutting, dressing, etc. Perhaps the skill intended will have included the best selection of trees, as well as the neatest and quickest laying of them prostrate, and if beyond this it included the sawing and dressing and shaping of the wood, the room for superiority of skill would be ample. <span class="cmt_word">My servants</span> (so vers. 2, 18; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-15.htm">1 Kings 5:15</a>).

The former Hebrew word is that constantly employed for "plagues," "strokes," etc., and it is nowhere but in this place rendered "beaten." <span class="cmt_word">I will give to thy servants</span>. This passage is hard to reconcile with what is said in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>; but meantime it is not certain that it needs to be reconciled with it. It is possible that the two passages are distinct. The contents of the present verse, at all events, need not be credited with any ambiguity, unless, indeed, we would wish it more definite, whether the expression, "I will give <span class="accented">to</span> thy servants," may not be quite as correctly understood, "<span class="accented">for</span> thy servants," <span class="accented">i.e. to thee as</span> the hire of them. If this be so, it would enable us to give at once <span class="accented">all the wheat</span>, and <span class="accented">two hundred</span> out of the 20,000 baths of oil, for the consumption, not of the literal workmen, but of the royal household. Then this granted, the verse, though not identical with <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-11.htm">1 Kings 5:11</a>, is brought into harmony with it. Reverting to the statement in <a href="../../par/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5</a>, what we learn is that Solomon, in his application to Hiram, offers payment for the hire of his servants such as he shall appoint (ver. 6). Hiram's reply is that he shall be satisfied to receive as payment "food <span class="accented">for his household"</span> (ver. 9), the amount of it and the annual payment of it being specified in ver. 11. This is the whole case, the discrepancies in which are plain, but they do not amount to contradictions. The appearance that is worn on the face of things is that the writer in Chronicles gives what came to be the final arrangement as to remuneration, though confessedly it is placed as much as the account in Kings in the draft of Solomon's original application to Hiram. <span class="cmt_word">Measures</span>. These were cots, and the cot was the same as the homer. From a calculation of some doubtfulness, however, made under the suggestions of <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22</a>, it has been said that the consumption of the royal household of <span class="accented">Solomon</span> was above 32,000 measures. The cor, or homer, was the largest of the five dry measures of capacity, being equal to 180 <span class="accented">cabs</span>, 100 <span class="accented">omers</span>, 30 <span class="accented">seahe</span>, 10 <span class="accented">ephahs</span> (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3.1741), though what was the exact value of any one of these in modern measures has only been uncertainly and very approximately arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Baths</span>.

In the parallel of Kings an identical expression is used for the communications of both: "Solomon sent to Hiram" (ver. 2), and "Hiram sent to Solomon" (ver. 8). The productions of the forms of this correspondence by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 8:2)and Eupolemus ('Ap. Praep. Evang.,' 9:33) are, of course, merely mythical. <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord hath loved his people.</span> This beautiful expression has parallels, not only in such passages as <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-8.htm">2 Chronicles 9:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-9.htm">1 Kings 10:9</a>; but in such as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-15.htm">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/115-12.htm">Psalm 115:12</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1, 4</a>. These were all precursors of the fuller assertion and kinder demonstration of God's love repeated so often and in such tender connections in the Epistles of the New Testament. This verse and the following are also testimony to the indirect influences on surrounding nations of the knowledge of the one true Creator-God and Ruler-God, that was domiciled by special revelation and oracle (<a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>) with Israel. Where nations near were bitter foes, they often feared Israel's God, whereas now they were friends they could summon to their lips the highest of the outbursts of praise, not to say of adoration. The very noteworthy sympathy of Hiram with Israel may have owed something to his personal predilection for David (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>).

But the following word translated "my father" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>) is less easily explained; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-16.htm">2 Chronicles 4:16</a> ("<span class="accented">his</span> father") is quite sufficient to negative the rendering" father" altogether. In our text altogether inappropriate, it may be called there altogether impossible.

However, Gesenius (in '<span class="accented">Lexicon</span>,' <span class="accented">sub roe.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span> (6), which see) furnishes a signification, "chief counsellor," which (taking it to mean chief counsellor, or as it were expert, chief referee, or even only <span class="accented">foreman</span> in such matters as might be in question) would well suit all the passages, and remove all difficulty.

This must mean, either that she was a widow <span class="accented">now</span>, or that she was a widow when "the man of Tyre" married her. If this latter is the correct meaning, it has been suggested that, though the mother was really a woman of the daughters of Dan, yet the husband who, dying, left her a widow, was of the tribe of Naphtali, and that from this <span class="accented">she</span> became credited with belonging to that tribe. It would seem not altogether impossible that it may be intended to state, in a delicate way, that this remarkably able man was the natural son of the widow in question, "the man of Tyre" (not called <span class="accented">her husband</span>) being the father.

The explanation probably is that of the 3600 "stranger" overseers, the small proportion of 300 were of much higher grade in office than the rest, and were ranked by the writer in Kings with those overseers (250) of Solomon, who were probably Israelites. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../2_chronicles/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="2 Chronicles 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_chronicles/30.htm"><title>2 Chronicles 30 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_chronicles/30.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_chronicles/30.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_chronicles/30-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_chronicles/29.htm" title="2 Chronicles 29">&#9668;</a> 2 Chronicles 30 <a href="../2_chronicles/31.htm" title="2 Chronicles 31">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-1.htm">2 Chronicles 30:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hezekiah sent...  wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh</span>. Some have sought to bring into the appearance of harmony the two first clauses of this verse by supposing that the former clause purports to say that Hezekiah sent messengers to all Israel and Judah, and in particular letters in addition to Ephraim and Manasseh, the chief tribes of the northern kingdom and the Joseph tribes. Vers. 6 and 10, however, seem to dispose effectually of this offer of explanation; while another explanation, that the names of the two tribes are simply to be taken as equivalent to "all Israel," seems true, though, in fact, it may be to advance us no way at all. We should prefer in the difficulty, unimportant though it is, yet one facing us, rather to assume that the verse wishes to say that Hezekiah <span class="accented">sent</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> sent messengers, which prove to be the <span class="accented">runners</span>, rendered the "posts") to all Israel and Judah, and to Ephraim, Manasseh, and the rest of their allied tribes by implication, but not to Judah wrote letters also which were carried by the posts (.or runners). It is true that ver. 6 may negative even this conjecture for getting over the difficulty, but <span class="accented">not</span> necessarily no, for it only says that the posts went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters, which they may be supposed to have dropped only to some, not to all, and those some <span class="accented">Israel</span>, or Ephraim, Manasseh, and brethren. There will have been to hand other, the usual methods of communication with Judah, from Jerusalem its metropolis, and from its king. The thing <span class="accented">different from</span> "letters" that was circulated may have been just the "proclamation" of ver. 5. It has been suggested that the now King of Israel, Hoshea, was very probably a captive of Assyria at this exact time (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>).

This verse and these items of it may without any inconvenient strain be made conterminous with just one verse in Kings, the thirteenth of <a href="../../par/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18</a>. The king personally seems to have devoted himself especially to the siege of Lachish, an Amoritish city indeed originally, and a place of great strength of petition, but conquered by Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26, 31-35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>; and <span class="accented">infra</span> here and in parallel).

A weak rendering for the preferable <span class="accented">purposed</span> or <span class="accented">boasted to break them</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>).

Jerusalem</span>. Whether the three verses of ill omen already alluded to (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14-16</a>) may be road precedent to this verse, and purport that the bribes had <span class="accented">been paid</span>, and yet had failed of their object, so that Hezekiah was now compelled to brace himself to the occasion, and "took counsel," etc. (next verse); or whether this verse dates (as some think)the quailing heart of Hezekiah, and an <span class="accented">offer</span> or <span class="accented">part</span> payment of treasure by Hezekiah to Sennacherib, which only increased his insolence, as immediately now related, is uncertain, perhaps. In the face of the emphatic language of the three verses of the parallel, and in consideration of the possible motives as suggested above for our compiler omitting the matter altogether, we incline to the former opinion. That would have the effect of making this verse say that when Hezekiah had his eyes opened to the failure of his bribe - a waste payment, for that Sennacherib still "purposed to fight against Jerusalem" - he finally proceeded to take the right steps. However, the witness and indications of <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13-19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2-4</a>, may go some way to shield Hezekiah from the entire blame. The silence of our compiler on the whole matter is the one residuum of fact, and unfortunate in its suggestion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-3.htm">2 Chronicles 32:3</a></div><div class="verse">He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which <i>were</i> without the city: and they did help him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To stop the waters of the fountains... without the city</span>. These fountains or springs were probably those represented by <span class="accented">En Rogel</span>, on the <span class="accented">Ophel spur</span> or very large mound, or fortified hill (mistranslated possibly from that circumstance "tower," in <a href="../../par/2_kings/5-24.htm">2 Kings 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), on the southeast of the temple. The object of Hezekiah is obvious enough. The word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>) for "stopping" occurs in all thirteen times - twice in piel in Genesis, once in niph. in Nehemiah, and ten times in kal in Kings, Chronicles, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Psalms. It is for all material purposes very uniformly rendered in all these places by the word "stop" eight times, and otherwise "shut" or "closed," or to carry a derived meaning, "hidden" or "secret." If the word "shut" or "shut off" were employed, it would fit every occasion. So we are not told here how he stopped the fountain or fountains, but that he shut the waters off from one direction and guided them into another, vie. by a conduit running <span class="accented">westward</span> from the springs and the Gihon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the brook) flowing naturally down the Tyropoean valley to a pool prepared for it in the city (see our ver. 30; and <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/20-20.htm">2 Kings 20:20</a>; Ecclus, 48:17; and Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 339).

On the other side, there is very little additional in our narrative, a few words heightening the effect in our vers. 18, 20, 21, constituting the whole of such additional matter. The vague mark of time, <span class="cmt_word">after this</span>, with which our present verse opens, merely says that in due course of Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, and attack of the fenced cities (ver. 1), he proceeds to send his servants and his insolent defiances to the metropolis, Jerusalem itself. The three words in italics, "himself <span class="accented">laid</span> "siege," should evidently give place to the single word "remained" or "was;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he and all his host with him remained at, or opposite to, Lachish, while his servants went to defy Jerusalem in his name.

This Authorized Version rendering is manifestly incorrect, though, if we simply omit the article, and tender <span class="accented">in siege</span>, we shall probably have Sennacherib's exact idea. He spoke not of the literal technical thing siege, but of the distress and confinement that the apprehension of the siege did not fail to bring. This so to say moral tone to the rendering of the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>) is much to be preferred to that of the margin, "in <span class="accented">the fortress</span> or <span class="accented">stronghold</span>."

This may be an indication that it was indeed not one son only whom Manasseh "caused to pass through the fire" (ver. 6). He emulated the sins of the former life of his father, but did not, like him, repent.

The conduct of Josiah from very tender years, which could not have been entirely his own, but must be credited in part to those who taught and influenced him, throws the balance of probability, perhaps, into this latter and more charitable view.

Our present passage may intend to glance at the fact that the bettor part of Israel were in captivity; and it will be possible, at any rate, to read the last clause as intending, not "for them that <span class="accented">are left</span> in Judah," but "and for them in Judah." <span class="cmt_word">That is poured out</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.

So here again, as above (ver. 21). Yet our Septuagint has "kindled;" and also the parallel in the Hebrew. The word "quenched," which immediately follows, suits the word "kindled," and what with the testimony of the Septuagint, both here and in ver. 21, and the Hebrew in both passages of the parallel, suggests that "poured" is the substitution, by some mishap, of a copyist - a mishap, for instance, that might result from the copyist writing from the speech of some one, and not from his own inspection. Exactly similar mistakes may often be seen in our maps, where the spelling and misspelling of the name of some place seem only to be accounted for by the same supposition. The catastrophe now foretold befell the nation manifestly in the reigns of the succeeding sovereigns, whose days were emphatically both few and evil, viz. the two sons of Josiah, Jehoahaz and Eliakim, whose name was changed to Jehoiakim; and the two sons of this latter, Jehoiachin and Zedekiah (according to <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>, the same with <span class="accented">Mattaniah</span>, and son of <span class="accented">Josiah</span>).

A period of about thirteen years of happy retrospect is now the portion of the good king.

Where the fault or sin of Josiah lay - whether he ran before he was sent, or whether, according to our following two verses, he set out <span class="accented">against</span> the Divine word by Necho - is certainly a question left in obscurity. Nothing is said in our history or its parallel to accredit the tale of Necho, or to discredit the heart and motive of Josiah - nothing <span class="accented">except</span> what silence and the result <span class="accented">seem</span> to say. One other clement of interest and of difficulty may be added to the question; for of the thirteen years' interval, which we have described above as one presumably of happy retrospect in certain aspects for Josiah, we know nothing from Scripture, but have <span class="accented">every</span> reason to suppose that during it Josiah and his kingdom had become subject, if only nominally, to Nabopolassar; so that, in offering to resist Necho of Egypt, he was offering to strengthen so far forth the royal line which did dishonour to his own country and his country's God. Upon this supposition, however, we can lay no stress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a></div><div class="verse">But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? <i>I come</i> not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from <i>meddling with</i> God, who <i>is</i> with me, that he destroy thee not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not against thee this day</span>.

It is indeed possible that they might purport, from the pen of the writer of Chronicles, that in point of fact the words of Necho had been the permitted warning, though not the actually dictated language of God. The genius of the whole passage strongly reminds us of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17, 19-21</a>; and its parallel in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of Megiddo</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> among those hills which separate the country of the coast from Esdraelon - a valley as that "of Kishon" (see Stanley's 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 356, 339, 347; but see also Conder's 'Handbook,' p. 287, where a different view is taken).

With the proclamation of <span class="accented">Cyrus</span> begins in fact the manhood, with all its mystic, its wonderful, and its still non-progressing struggles, of the Jew. His simple childhood, wilful youth, am indeed for ever gone. But he and his nation are with unspeakably painful travail born. No life of nation that is or ever has been merits the devout observation and study that this unchal-lengeably does. Our present verse and the one succeeding it are, sentence for sentence, the same with the opening verses of the Book of Ezra, which may possibly once have joined on to Chronicles, as one work, though we think this exceedingly unlikely. Cyrus (the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> of the Hebrew text) was the son of a royal Persian, Cambysses; his mother was Mandane, daughter of Astyages, last King of Media. The name appears on the monuments, written <span class="accented">Kurus.</span> Cyrus defeated his grandfather Astyages,  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>; ending thereby the Median royal line; and he defeated Croesus,  <span class="date">B.C. 546</span>, possessing himself thereby of the kingdom of Lydia; he took Babylon, as above,  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>. He himself died in battle,  <span class="date">B.C. 529</span>. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord by...

The fact is told us, and this, no doubt, as on a thousand other unsuspected occasions of far more intrinsic and vital interest in the Bible, is sufficient. It would have been interesting to know, however, even here, the mode in which Cyrus was appealed to; as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, it has been plausibly suggested that Daniel may have been in part instrumental in the work, and that, again, in part perhaps by directing the attention of Cyrus to <a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a></div><div class="verse">Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> in Judah.

The adopting by Cyrus of the Hebrew "Jehovah" in both these places cannot escape our notice. There can be no room to doubt that Cyrus was acquainted with the sacred literature of the Hebrews, and especially with the writings of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as with the language of Daniel. It may have been partly a graceful act on the part of Cyrus to word his proclamation to the Jews thus, or it may have been simply, what under the circumstances came most naturally to him, with little or no intention in it either way. The numerous passages in Ezra parallel in matter with this verse do not need specification here. Now begins the new period of Jewish life, with fiercer probation, with unbounded and various trial, and probably of world-length continuance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../2_chronicles/35.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="2 Chronicles 35"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Chronicles 35" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../ezra/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Ezra 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Ezra 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/2_chronicles/3.htm"><title>2 Chronicles 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/2_chronicles/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/2_chronicles/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/2_chronicles/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../2_chronicles/2.htm" title="2 Chronicles 2">&#9668;</a> 2 Chronicles 3 <a href="../2_chronicles/4.htm" title="2 Chronicles 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where <i>the LORD</i> appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mount Moriah</span>.

Whether the name designates the same place in each instance is more than doubtful. In the present passage the connection of the place with David is marked. Had it been the spot connected with Abraham and the proposed sacrifice of Isaac, it is at least probable that this also would have been emphasized, and not here only, but in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17-25</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16-26</a>; but in neither of these places is there the remotest suggestion of such fame of old belonging to it. Nor in later passages of history (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Nehemiah's rebuilding, and in the prophets, and the New Testament), where the opportunities would have been of the most tempting, is there found one single suggestion of the kind. There am also at fewest two reasons of a positive and intriusic character against Solomon's Moriah being Abraham's - in that this latter was a specially conspicuous height (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>), and was a secluded and comparatively desolate place, neither of which features attach to Solomon's Moriah. Nevertheless the identity theory is stoutly maintained by names as good as those of Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 475); Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 152); Hengstenberg ('Genuineness of Pentateuch, 2:162, Ryland's tr.); Kurtz ('History of O. C.,' 1:271); and Knobel and Kalisch under the passage in Genesis - against Grove (in Dr. Smith's ' Bible Dictionary'); Stanley (' Sinai and Palestine,' p. 251;'Jewish Church,' 1. 49); De Wette, Bleek, and Tischendorf [see 'Speaker's Commentary,' under <a href="../../par/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>]. Though there is some uncertainty as to the more exact form of the derivation of the name Moriah, it seems most probable that the meaning of it may be "the sight of Jehovah." Where <span class="cmt_word">the Lord appeared unto David his father.</span> The clause is no doubt elliptical, and probably it is not to be mended by the inserting of the words," the Lord," as in our Authorized Version. We do not read anywhere that the Lord did then and there appear to David, though we do read that "the angel of the Lord" appeared to him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-16.htm">2 Samuel 24:16</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15, 19</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). Nor is it desirable to force the niph. preterite of the verb here, rightly rendered "appeared" or "was seen," into "was shown." We should prefer to solve the difficulty occasioned by the somewhat unfinished shape of the clause (or clauses) by reading it in close relation to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>. Then the vivid impressions that had been made both by works and words of the angel of the Lord caused David to feel and to say with emphasis, "This is the (destined) house of the Lord God," etc. In this light our present passage would read, in a parenthetic manner, "which (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the house, its Moriah position and all) was seen of David;" or with somewhat more of ease, "as was seen of David;" and the following "in the place," etc., will read in a breath with the preceding "began to build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem...  in the place," etc. <span class="cmt_word">David had prepared</span> (so <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2-4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the threshing-floor of Ornan</span> (so <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-15.htm">1 Chronicles 21:15, 16, 18, 21-28</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-2.htm">2 Chronicles 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And he began to build in the second <i>day</i> of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the second day.</span> The word "day" as italicized in our Authorized Version type is of course not found in the Hebrew text. Several manuscripts fail also to show the other words of this clause, viz. "In the second;" and that they are probably spurious derives confirmation from the fact that neither the Arabic nor Syriac Versions, nor the Septuagint nor Vulgate translations, produce them. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the second month, in the fourth year</span>. Reading the verse, therefore, as though it began thus, the most interesting but doubtful question of fixing an exact chronology for what preceded Solomon's reign is opened. In our present text there is little sign of anything to satisfy the offers to do so, if only again to disappoint the more grievously. There we read of "four hundred and eighty years" from the Exodus to this beginning of the building of Solomon's temple. Now, this latter date can be determined with tolerable accuracy (viz. as some twenty years before  <span class="date">B.C. 1000</span>) by travelling backwards from the date (n.c. 536) of Cyrus taking Babylon, and the beginning of the return from the Captivity ( <span class="date">B.C. 535</span>), making allowance for the seventy years of the Captivity, the duration of the line of separate Judah-kings, and the <span class="accented">remanet</span>, a large one, of the years of Solomon's reign. All this, however, helps nothing at all the period stretching from the Exodus to the beginning of the building of the temple. And the events of this period, strongly corroborated by other testimony (see Canon Rawlinson, 'Speaker's Commentary,' vol. it. pp. 575, 576), seem to show convincingly that no faith can be reposed in the authenticity of the chronological statement of our parallel.

This possibly means the cubit of pre-Captivity times, but at all events the Israelites' own ancient cubit - perhaps a hand-breadth (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>) longer than the present, or seven in place of six. The cubit (divided into six palms, and a palm into four finger-breadths) was the unit of Hebrew lineal measure. It stands for the length from the elbow to the wrist, the knuckle, or the tip of the longest finger. There is still considerable variation in opinion as to the number of inches that the cubit represents, and considerable perplexity as to the two or three different cubits (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>) mentioned in Scripture. One of the latest authorities, Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., pp. 56-59, 371, 386), gives what seem to be reasons of almost decisive character for regarding the cubit of the temple buildings as one of sixteen inches. The subject is also discussed at length in Smith's ' Bible Dictionary,' 3:1736 - 1739. And the writer finally concludes to accept, under protest, Thenius's calculations, which give the cubit as rather over nineteen inches. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-4.htm">2 Chronicles 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the porch that <i>was</i> in the front <i>of the house</i>, the length <i>of it was</i> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The porch...  an hundred and twenty.</span> The "porch" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). It is out of the question that the porch should be of this height in itself. And almost as much out of the question that, if it could be so, this should be the only place to mention it by word or. description. There can be no doubt that the text is here slightly corrupt, and perhaps it is a further indication of this that, while the parallel contains <span class="accented">nothing</span> of the height, <span class="accented">this</span> place fails (but comp. our ver. 8) to give the breadth ("ten cubits"), which the parallel does give. The words for" hundred" and for "cubit" easily confuse with one another. And our present Hebrew text, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, will make good Hebrew syntax, and be in harmony with the Septuagint (Alexandrian), and with the Syriac and Arabic Versions. This gives the height of the porch as 20 cubits, which will be in harmony with the general height of the building, which was 30 cubits. Thus far, then, the plan of the temple is plain. The house is 60 cubits long, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 20 for the holy of holies (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>);40 for the holy place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>); and for breadth 20 cubits. The porch was in <span class="accented">length</span> the same as the breadth of the <span class="accented">house</span>, viz. 20 cubits, but in <span class="accented">breadth</span> it was 10 cubits (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) only, while its height was 20 cubits, against a height of 30 cubits for the "house" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Overlaid it within with pure gold</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> covered the planks with gold leaf, or sometimes with plates of gold (Ovid., 'L Epp. ex. Pont,' 1:37, 38, 41, 42; Herod., 1:98; Polyb., 10:27. &sect; 10). The appreciation, as well as bare knowledge, of gold belonged to a very early date (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>). The days when it was used in ring or lump (though not in coin) for sign of wealth and for purposes of exchange, and also for ornament (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-2.htm">Genesis 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/42-21.htm">Genesis 42:21</a>), indicate how early were the beginnings of metallurgy as regards it, though much more developed afterwards (<a href="../../par/judges/17-4.htm">Judges 17:4</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/17-3.htm">Proverbs 17:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-19.htm">Isaiah 40:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9</a>); and show it in the time of David and Solomon no rare art, even though foreign workmen, for obvious reasons, were the most skilful workers with it. There are four verbs used to express the idea of overlaying, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in hiph. This occurs only in this chapter, vers. 5, 7, 8, 9; but in niph. <a href="../../par/psalms/68-13.htm">Psalm 68:13</a> may be compared. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in hiph. This occurs in the present sense, though not necessarily staying very closely by it; in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15, 16</a>, and its parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16, 17</a>); and perhaps in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>. The meaning of the word, however, is evidently so generic that it scarcely postulates the rendering "overlay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> in piel. This occurs in our present verse, as also in a multitude of other places in Chronicles, Kings, Samuel, and Exodus. The radical idea of the verb (kal) is "to be bright." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> in hiph. This occurs only once (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-32.htm">1 Kings 6:32</a>). No one of these verbs in itself bespeaks certainly of which or what kind the overlaying might be, unless it be the last, the analogy of which certainly points to the sense of a thin <span class="accented">spreading.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-5.htm">2 Chronicles 3:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The greater house</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the holy place. <span class="cmt_word">He ceiled</span>. This rendering is wrong. The verb is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> given above (ver. 4). It is repeated in the next clause of this very verse as "overlaid," as also in vers. 7, 8, 9. The generic word "covered" would serve all the occasions on which the word occurs here. From a comparison of the parallel it becomes plain that the meaning is that the crone structure of floor and walls was covered over with wood (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-7.htm">1 Kings 6:7, 15, 18</a>). That wood for the floor was <span class="accented">fir</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-15.htm">1 Kings 6:15</a>), probably slim for the <span class="accented">walls</span>, which must depend partly on the translation of this ver. 15. It would seem to say that (beside the stone) there was an inner stratum, both to walls and floor, of <span class="accented">cedar</span> (reason for which would be easy of conjecture). But another translation obviates the necessity of this inner stratum supposition, rendering "from the floor to the top of the wall." According to this, while the overlaying gold was on cedar for walls and ceiling (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-9.htm">1 Kings 6:9</a>), it was on fir for the floor, which does <span class="accented">not seem what our</span> present verse purports, unless, according to the suggestion of some, "fir" be interpreted to include cedar. <span class="cmt_word">Set thereon palm trees and chains</span>. These were, of course, <span class="accented">carvings.</span> The <span class="accented">chains</span>, not mentioned in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-29.htm">1 Kings 6:29</a>; but see 1 Kings 7:17), were probably wreaths of chain design or pattern. Easier modern English would read "put thereon."

The exact manner in which these were applied or fixed is not stated. What the precious stones were, however, need not be doubtful (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>; the obvious references for which passage, <a href="../../par/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11, 12</a> and <a href="../../par/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18-21</a>, cannot be forgotten.

What this word designates, or, if a place, where the place was, is not known. Gesenius ('Lexicon,' <span class="accented">sub vet.</span>) would derive it from a Sanskrit word, purva, meaning "oriental." Hitzig suggests another Sanskrit word, <span class="accented">paru</span>, meaning "hill," and indicating the "twin hills" of Arabia (Prof., 6:7. &sect; 11) as the derivation. And Knobel suggests that it is a form of <span class="accented">Sepharvaim</span>, the Syriac and Jonathan Targum version of <span class="accented">Sephar</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-30.htm">Genesis 10:30</a>). The word does not occur in any other Bible passage (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' vol. it. p. 711).

In the parallel this statement is placed in company with that respecting the "palms and flowers." Layard tells us that all the present description of decoration bears strong resemblance to the Assyrian. There can be no difficulty in imagining this, both in other respects, and in connection with the fact that foreigners, headed by the chief designer Hiram, had so large a share in planning the details of temple workmanship. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-8.htm">2 Chronicles 3:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he made the most holy house, the length whereof <i>was</i> according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, <i>amounting</i> to six hundred talents.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The most holy house.</span> The writer proceeds from speaking of "the greater house" (ver. 5), or holy place, to the "holy of holies." The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20</a>) adds the height, as also 20 cubits<span class="cmt_word">. Six hundred talents.</span> It is impossible to assert with any accuracy the money value intended here. Six hundred talents of gold is an amazing proportion of the yearly revenue of 666 talents of gold, spoken of in <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14</a>. This latter amount is worth, in Keil's estimate, about three million and three quarters of our money, but in Peele's estimate nearer double that! The Hebrew, Phoenician, and Assyrian unit of weight is the same, and one quite different from the Egyptian. The <span class="accented">silver</span> talent (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ciccar</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) contained 60 manehs, each maneh being equal to 50 shekels, and a shekel being worth 220 grains; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> there were 3000 shekels, or 660,000 grains, in such talent. But the <span class="accented">gold</span> talent con-rained 100 manehs, the maneh 100 shekels, and the shekel 132 grains, making this gold talent the equivalent of 10,000 shekels, or 1,320,000 grains. The "holy shekel," or "shekel of the sanctuary," could be either of gold or silver (<a href="../../par/exodus/38-4.htm">Exodus 38:4, 5</a>). (For some treatment of this still unsatisfactory subject, see Dr. Smith's . Bible Dictionary,' 3:1727-1736; and Conder's ' Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., pp. 64-78, 81.)

According to the above scale, therefore, this weight would be a twelve-thousandth part for the nails of all the weight of the overlaying plates of gold. <span class="cmt_word">The upper chambers</span>. This is the first mention of these "chambers" in the present description, but they have been alluded to by the Chronicle writer before, in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-11.htm">1 Chronicles 28:11</a>. What or where they were is as yet not certainly ascertained. Presumably they were the highest tier of those chambers which surrounded three sides of the main building. But some think they were a superstructure to the holy of holies; others, high chambers in the supposed very lofty superstructure of the porch. Both of these suppositions seem to us of the unlikeliest. It would, however, be much more satisfactory, considering that all the subject before and after treats of the most holy place, to be able to connect this expression in some way with it, nor is there any reason evident for overlaying richly with gold the aforesaid chambers (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-4.htm">2 Chronicles 9:4</a> compared with 2 Chronicles 22:11) of the third tier.

Gesenius traces it to "an unused" Hebrew root <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, of Arabic derivation (meaning "to carry on the trade of a goldsmith"), and offers to translate it "statuary" work with the Vulgate (<span class="accented">opus statuarium</span>). The parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23</a>) gives simply "wood of oil" (not "olive," <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the oleaster tree wood. It is obvious that some of the characters of these words would go some way to make the other unknown word. But it must be confessed that our text shows no external indications of a corrupt reading.

This, like all the preceding cubit measurings of the temple foundations and heights, and with all the succeeding cherubim measurings, is the exact double of that observed by Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/37-6.htm">Exodus 37:6-9</a>). The <span class="accented">height</span> of the cherubim, ten cubits, not mentioned in our text, is given in the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-26.htm">1 Kings 6:26</a>).

The position of these cherubim, both as to wings and faces, was clearly different from that of those for the tabernacle of Moses. There they "cover the mercy-seat with their wings, and their faces are one to another...  toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim" (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-9.htm">Exodus 37:9</a>). May this alteration in the time of Solomon indicate possibly one more advance in the developing outlook of Divine mercy to a whole world? Neither this place nor the parallel makes it certain whether the cherubim, that are here said to stand on their feet, stood on the <span class="accented">ground</span>, as some say they did. As regards those of the tabernacle, the prepositions used in <a href="../../par/exodus/25-18.htm">Exodus 25:18, 19</a> and Exodus 37:7, 8 appear to lay stress on their position being a fixture at and on each extremity of the mercy-seat.

On the other hand, it is remarkable that our present passage does not make mention of the folding "doors of olive tree," which, with "the veil," intercepted the approach to the oracle (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31, 32</a>), nor of the partition walls (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-16.htm">1 Kings 6:16</a>) in which they were situate, nor of the "partition chains [<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-21.htm">1 Kings 6:21</a>] of gold before the oracle." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that <i>was</i> on the top of each of them <i>was</i> five cubits.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty and five cubits</span>.

Some therefore think that the height given in our text describes rather the distance of the one pillar from the other, which would be just 35 cubits, if they stood at the extreme points of the line of the porch front; since the wings on each side (5 cubits for the lowest chamber, and 2.5 cubits for the thickness of the walls) would make up this amount. It is further noticed with this explanation that their height (18 cubits) with the chapiters (5 cubits) added, would bring them to the same height as the porch, and that their ornamentation agrees with that of the porch (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-19.htm">1 Kings 7:19</a>). All this may be the case. Yet considering other indications of uncertainty about our text, and the fact that the characters <span class="accented">yod kheth</span> (18) are easily superseded by <span class="accented">lamed he</span> (35), it is perhaps likelier that we have here simply a clerical error. The parallel place tells us that these pillars and the chapiters were cast of brass; that "a line [<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15</a>; Jeremiah 52:41] of twelve cubits [not seven] did compass either of them about;" that the ornamentation of each chapiter was "a net of checker-work, and a wreath of chain-work;" that upon the five cubits of chapiter there was another "four cubits of lily-work," etc. If this last feature apply to the two pillars, and not (as some think) to the porch only, the pillars would reach a height of 27 cubits, and if it be supposed that they stood on some stone or other superstructure, it may still be that our "thirty-five cubits" has its meaning. Meantime the passage in Jeremiah (Jeremiah 52:41) tells us that the pillars were hollow, and that the thickness of the metal was "four fingers."

Though the writer of Chronicles has not in this description mentioned any chains as appertaining to the oracle, yet they are mentioned in the parallel. The selection of what is said has in our present text so much the appearance of haste, that this may account for the abrupt appearance of the allusion here. Otherwise the words, "in the oracle," tempt us to fear some corruptness of text, scarcely safely removed by Bertheau's suggestion to substitute <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> ("ring") for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> ("oracle"). <span class="cmt_word">An hundred pomegranates</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-13.htm">2 Chronicles 4:13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15, 18, 20</a>).

This in worthier material superseded the temporary altar of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1, 2</a>), made of shittim wood, and its dimensions five cubits long and broad and three cubits high. Large as was the present altar of brass as compared with the altar that preceded, it fell far short of the requirements of the grand day of dedication (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a>). No statement of the making of this altar occurs in the parallel. The place of it would be between vers. 22 and 23 of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. But that Solomon made it is stated in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a>, and other references to its presence are found in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22, 54, 64</a>, etc. The position given to the altar is referred to alike in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-22.htm">1 Kings 8:22</a> and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12, 13</a>, as in the court of the temple. It may be well to note that the altar, <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>, comes first, and is first spoken of. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-2.htm">2 Chronicles 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A molten sea</span>. The Hebrew of this verse and of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23</a> are facsimiles of one author, except that here <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> stands, where the parallel shows <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, probably the fruit merely of some error in transcription. Verses like these point not to the derivation of Chronicles from Kings, but rather of both from some older common source. This sea of brass superseded the laver of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18, 28</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/31-9.htm">Exodus 31:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/35-16.htm">Exodus 35:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-39.htm">Exodus 39:39</a>). It was called a sea on account of its size. We are told in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a> whence David had drawn the supplies of metal necessary for this work. The size of the diameter measured from upper rim to rim (ten cubits) harmonizes, of course, to all practical purposes, with that of the circumference (thirty cubits); it would assist questions connected with the contents of this large vessel, however, if we had been told whether the circumference were measured at the rim, or, as the form of language here used might slightly favour, round the girth. (For these questions, see ver. 5 below.) This sea for the washing of the priests significantly follows the altar. Beside the general suggestion of the need of purification or sanctification, it here reminds of the fact that the earthly priest and high priest must need the purification, which their great Antitype would not need. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-3.htm">2 Chronicles 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">And under it <i>was</i> the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.

The presence of the word "similitude" strongly suggests that the circles of decoration under description showed the likenesses of oxen, not necessarily (as Patrick) "stamped" on the so-called knops, but possibly constituting them. For the ambiguous under it of our present verse the parallel says with definiteness, "under the brim of it." There is intelligibility, at all events, in the ornamentation being of these miniature oxen, presumably three hundred in the circle of the thirty cubits. The symbolism would harmonize with that which dictated the superposition of the enormous vase on twelve probably life-size oxen. There is a general preference, however, accorded to the opinion that the present text has probably been the result of some copyist's corruption, and that the text of the parallel should be followed.

It received and held should be translated, <span class="accented">it was able</span> to <span class="accented">hold</span>. Three thousand baths. The parallel has two thousand baths, and this latter is the likelier reading. It is, however, conceivable that the statement of Kings may purport to give the quantity of water used, and that of Chronicles the quantity which the vessel at its fullest could accommodate. As to the real capacity of the bath, we are hopelessly at sea. Josephus's estimate of it is about eight gallons and a half, that of the rabbinists about four gallons and a half (see Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 3:1742), and Conder, in the 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 80, a fractional quantity above six gallons. The largest bowls on the Assyrian bas-reliefs, the silver bowl of Croesus, and the bronze bowl in Scythia (Herodotus, 1:51; 4:81), did not, under the lowest estimate of the bath, hold as much as one-half of the contents of this vast sea of brass of Solomon. The use of this vessel was, as we read in the next verse, for the priests to wash in, or, as some would read, to wash at (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18-20</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea <i>was</i> for the priests to wash in.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - This verse, with vers. 14, 15, are all here that represent the lengthy account of bases rather than layers, occupying in the parallel vers. 27-39 of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>, which, however, omits to state the use of either sea or layers.

The only allusion to these in the parallel is found later on in part of the forty-ninth verse of <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>. According to their form. This expression, though so vague, might point to the fact that the form of the old candlestick of the tabernacle was adhered to (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-31.htm">Exodus 25:31</a>). But considering the recurrence of the same words (ver. 20), there can be no doubt that the phrase is identical in its meaning with the use found in such passages as <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-10.htm">Leviticus 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/9-16.htm">Leviticus 9:16</a>, and means "according to the prescribed ordinance,"

These tables also (the use of which is given in ver. 19) are not mentioned, so far as their making is concerned, in the parallel, except in its summary, ver. 48 (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>.), where furthermore only one table, called "the table" (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-23.htm">Exodus 25:23</a>), is specified, with which agrees our <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/29-18.htm">2 Chronicles 29:18</a>. It is hard to explain this variation of statement. It is at least an arbitrary and forced explanation to suppose that ten tables constituted the furniture in question, while only one was used at a time. Keil and Bertheau think that the analogy of the ten candlesticks points to the existence of ten tables. The question, however, is, where is the call for, or where are the indications of any analogy? <span class="cmt_word">An hundred basins of gold</span>.

This view can hardly be pressed. The very word "wherefore" in ver. 3 goes far to discredit it.

The stones were therefore now, in Solomon's time, nearly four hundred and ninety years old. Why the "golden pot" and "Aaron's rod" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>) were not there does not appear.

Possibly they may have now been removed by Solomon, but it seems very unlikely that, if so, no mention of the removal is made. On the other hand, the "book of the Law" had not been consigned to the ark, but to a place "by the side of" it (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-25.htm">Deuteronomy 31:25-27</a>).

So ends our inopportune Authorized Version parenthesis. But to what all this? It is a scene in a nation's history, in the universal Church's history; it is witnessed from heaven, and by Heaven's will recorded in the book on earth, which will endure through all generations, as long as the sun and moon endure, as ushering in the moment when, as described in the next verse, to the unanimous fervent adoration and praise of man, God bent a willing, gracious ear, and to earth the glory of heaven drew nigh. <span class="accented">Cymbals</span>. The word used here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), denoting strictly "pair of cymbals," occurs eleven times in Chronicles, once in Ezra, and once in Nehemiah. Another form of essentially the same word occurs once in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> and twice in <a href="../../par/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>. This last passage notes two kinds of cymbals - the "loud" and the "high-sounding." It was the former of these that Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun used, and their use was probably to regulate or beat the time (see Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1:375, 376; Conder's 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 167, 2nd edit.). <span class="accented">Psalteries</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span>). This word occurs twenty-eight times in the Old Testament, but of these it is translated (Authorized Version) four times as "viols" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/14-11.htm">Isaiah 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-23.htm">Amos 5:23</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-5.htm">Amos 6:5</a>); it is also once rendered "vessels of <span class="accented">flagons"</span> (<a href="../../par/isaiah/22-24.htm">Isaiah 22:24</a>), but the margin offers the version "instruments of viols." While the cymbal was, of course, an instrument of percussion, the psaltery was one of strings - its use was as an accompaniment to the voice. The first mention of it is very interesting (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). Compare also David's and Solomon's psaltery in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-11.htm">2 Chronicles 9:11</a>. <span class="accented">Harps</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>).

This word (including eleven of the personal forms of it, as e.g. the person <span class="accented">blowing the trumpet</span>) occurs just forty times, beginning with <a href="../../par/numbers/10-2.htm">Numbers 10:2</a>.

The <span class="accented">trumpets</span> of our verse evidently (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-8.htm">Numbers 10:8</a>) were in a particular sense the instrument of the priests.

It consists of two verses (14, 15) of opening; then follow three petitions - first, that God would perpetuate the line of David (ver. 16); <span class="accented">next</span>, that he would have regard to the place where his Name is put (vers. 17-20); and <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, that he would hear the prayers addressed to him toward this place (ver. 21). Of this last subject, seven different cases are propounded <span class="accented">- firstly</span>, the case of the man wronged by his neighbour (vers. 22, 23); <span class="accented">secondly</span>, of the people worsted by their enemies (vers. 24, 25); <span class="accented">thirdly</span>, of the people suffering from drought (vers. 26, 27); <span class="accented">fourthly</span>, of the people visited by death or special calamity (vers. 28-31); <span class="accented">fifthly</span>, of the stranger who comes to offer to pray (vers 32, 33); <span class="accented">sixthly</span>, of the people going to war by God's permission (vers. 34, 35); <span class="accented">seventhly</span>, of the people in captivity (vers. 36-39). Then the prayer closes in vers. 40-42.

Such supposition may bring us nearest to some tenable explanation of what otherwise seems the very unaccountable omission in the parallel. The language of our ver. 2 adds something to countenance this theory, coinciding as it does with the language of the last verses of ch. 5.

Let it be noticed that in both these verses the compiler of Chronicles avoids the words, "all Israel," and "all the children of Israel;" in favour of <span class="cmt_word">all the people</span>. The parallel tells us that the <span class="cmt_word">sacrifices</span> in part were <span class="accented">peace offerings</span>, eatable, therefore, by priests and people. Large as the numbers of the <span class="cmt_word">oxen and sheep</span> sacrificed, yet indications in the narrative round about do something to sustain them, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the number of people who had come together; the fact that all the people are said to offer sacrifices; the fact that Solomon, Because of the press for room (ver. 7), hallowed the <span class="cmt_word">middle of the court</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> probably the court itself, in order to find place for the "burnt offerings, meat offerings, and fat" (ver. 7); further, the number of mouths of people that certainly would need filling, not only on one day, but on days more than one, while on the third day (<a href="../../par/leviticus/19-6.htm">Leviticus 19:6</a>) any part of a peace offering still left was to be destroyed by fire. Nevertheless, the thought of the scene of butchery is, to our modern imagination, amazing to the last degree. An assemblage of people in Jerusalem, all making also for its temple, of a hundred and twenty thousand people, and a minimum of another twenty-two thousand people, is startling; but add to these a <span class="cmt_word">sheep</span> apiece for the former number, and an <span class="cmt_word">ox</span> apiece for the latter (a computation itself necessarily under the mark), and allow several days to be covered by the- killing and sacrificing, and one feels that the key and explanation of the present words of the Bible text in this very passage are scarcely in hand. The interesting note in the 'Speaker's Commentary' on <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-63.htm">1 Kings 8:63</a> scarcely assists us. Its instances of the "profusion" of the "sacrifices of antiquity" are altogether and immensely distanced by the narrative before us, not only in the number of victims, but in respect of the time in which the victims had to be despatched and disposed of, and the place and space within which, if not the slaughtering, yet certainly the offering, had to be done.

The word thus translated in the Authorized Version occurs (including both its but very slightly differing forms) eleven times. Five of these times the margin offers, probably unnecessarily, the optional rendering of "restraint." It may be that the root involves this idea, and certainly the word is especially used for the seventh or closing day of Passover, and eighth or closing day of Tabernacles; but other occasions of its use seem to negative this as an essential element in the signification or essential condition of the use of the word; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "Proclaim a solemn assembly" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/10-20.htm">2 Kings 10:20</a>); "Call a solemn assembly" (<a href="../../par/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-15.htm">Joel 2:15</a>).

The expressions that we have in this verse guide us amid some ambiguities to the correct date of the consecration of the temple. The verse purports to speak of the final completion the temple and the king's house or palace, with all whatsoever that was necessary to them in the matter of their furnishing. And, to say the least, the impression naturally produced on the reader is that they are spoken of as being <span class="accented">thus</span> completed simultaneously, although, beyond doubt, there was a sense in which the temple was (not utterly finished but) built long before the palace. Accordingly, when the next verse tells us of God's answer vouchsafed to the dedication prayer of Solomon, we <span class="cmt_word">are</span> not driven to the supposition that several years had elapsed since the final completion of the temple and the dedication of it on the one hand, nor, on the other hand, a similar interval lost between the dedication prayer and the Divine acknowledgment of it. It may be again stated that the main structure of the temple (not including courts, pillars, furnishing, vessels, etc.) was built after seven years' process, in the eleventh year of Solomon's reign, but the palace only after another complete twelve years (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a>), in Solomon's twenty-fourth year. A liberal study of the parallel narrative of Kings in its entirety strengthens considerably this view, inasmuch as there the whole account of the palace-building finds its place previous to the account of the dedicating of the temple. However, though there can be little practical doubt as to how the facts of the case stood and stand, yet this occasion must count one to be added to the chronological memorabilia of Scripture, in that, while both the accounts to which we have access leave very vague the very things we should naturally expect to have been stated concisely, they also both seem entirely unconscious of it - a directest outcome of the fact that both writers were but picking their own way in the midst of borrowed material, neither of them the original historian.

Although we can scarcely trace the principle of their selection from the seven parts of the prayer, they would seem to have been selected from the original work, as samples of a reply which presumably embraced reference to <span class="accented">all</span> the seven. When, in ver. 14, it is said, <span class="cmt_word">I will heal their land</span>, the telling expression, according to the Authorized Version, must be understood to refer to the removing of drought by rain. On the other hand, the Authorized Version is, in ver. 15, unfortunate in the unnecessary and misleading insertion of the <span class="accented">italics</span> found there, and in the use of the preposition "in" for <span class="accented">of</span>, the simple case <span class="accented">construct</span>, which is manifestly what is wanted and intended.

It is evident that these cities were in need of repair; possibly they had not been previously in the occupation of the Israelites; if they had been, the transaction was scarcely legitimate on the part of Solomon (<a href="../../par/leviticus/25-12.htm">Leviticus 25:12-33</a>), and we may suppose they had become largely deserted when made over to Hiram. It would not, however, be necessary to suppose either that Solomon had given them because they were poor property in his eyes, or that Hiram, whose good will and generous disposition are elsewhere specially notified, had returned them as a thankless gift or as a bad payment, but for the language of vers. 12, 13 (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9.htm">1 Kings 9</a>.), which distinctly tells us that when Hiram inspected them they did "not please him," and that he named them "the land of Oabul" (see Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 1. p. 237). The probability is that, as cities on the borderland, they were what had been at present unoccupied by Israelites, were all the likelier in bad repair, and, unvalued by Hiram, were, when put into good repair by Solomon, such that Solomon might justly <span class="cmt_word">cause the children of Israel to dwell</span> in them.

Hamath (when the name occurs separately) was a place both of great geographical note (occupying, whether regarded as a larger region or a town, an important position in the northern end of that broad valley of Coele-Syria which separates Lebanon and Antilebanon, and through which passed the river Orontes) and of great historical note from the time of the Exodus to that of Amos. The town, or city, is to be understood to be the Great Hamath (<a href="../../par/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a>). But the kingdom, or district, or county, was almost conterminous with Coele-Syria. Zobah, also a portion of Syria, amounted to a small kingdom, and is read of alike in Saul's and in David's times, as in Solomon's time. It probably lay to the north-east of Hamath (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8, 7, 8, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9, 16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-4.htm">1 Chronicles 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-16.htm">1 Chronicles 19:16</a>). But Hamath-zobah of this verse was probably a place called Hamath, in the region of Zobah, in which also two other cities are mentioned, Berothai and Tibhath, or Betah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>). These two kingdoms of Hamath and Zobah, contiguous as they were, seem as though they purposed to compliment one another - Zobah by naming one of its towns Hamath, and <span class="accented">vice versa</span> It is said that the Assyrian inscriptions show that they remained, after Solomon, distinct kingdoms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a></div><div class="verse">And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tadmor in the wilderness</span>. Tadmor, one with the classical Palmyra, lay in the desert of Syria, about half-way between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates, and distant from Damascus about a hundred and <span class="accented">forty</span> miles to its east-north-east. Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 8, note 1) says, "Is it quite certain that 'Tadmor' and 'Palmyra' are words derived from the (palms)? A palm is in Hebrew <span class="accented">tamar</span>...  and in Greek...  <span class="accented">phoenix."</span> Solomon was probably not the originator, but rather re-builder, of the place. Its fame was great under Zenobia, the Queen of Odenathus; she was taken captive by the Emperor Aurelian, A.D. 273, when the city was subdued. It is now little better than the haunt of a few Arabs Splendid ruins remain, specially of the great temple of the sun. The Hebrew text of <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> has apparently <span class="accented">Tamer</span>, or <span class="accented">Tamar</span>, and it has been suggested by Movers on that passage that possibly a Tamar in the south, and that is found in the neighbourhood of some of the other places, such as Baalath, Beth-heron, and Gezer, all in the south (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-19.htm">Ezekiel 47:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/48-28.htm">Ezekiel 48:28</a>; ch. 20:2), is intended. Our text, however, in the present place offers no choice, while that in Kings (compare Chethiv and Keri) is doubtful. And finally, our writer is <span class="accented">here</span> evidently in the neighbourhood of Hamath, which of course best suits Tadmor. Although there is an apparent disjointedness between this and the parallel, closer notice may rather bring confirmation of substantial agreement between them. For instance, the <span class="cmt_word">store cities</span> here spoken of as belonging to Hamath (but not individually named here and not corresponding with those that <span class="accented">are</span> named in Kings) are accounted for by the words, "and in Lebanon," in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>.

The name means "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">hollow</span> place." The upper Beth-heron was about four miles from Gibeon, and the lower about three miles further on. The Roman general Cestius Gallus was defeated here in the last Jewish war; Judas Maccabaeus conquered here (1 Maccabees 3:18-25).

The parallel charitably "whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy utterly," where our text shows with exacter fidelity, <span class="cmt_word">whom the children of Israel consumed not</span>.

The "levy "in <span class="accented">ver.</span> 21 of the parallel probably explains the suddenly mentioned similar language of its fifteenth verse, and again betrays the collected and copied nature of the historic material, the carefulness of sequence not being as observable in selection as might be desired. The distinction between the remnant of aliens and the people of Israel was manifestly that the <span class="accented">menial</span> and the laborious service was put on the former. Useful but familiar references to this whole subject are found in <a href="../../par/judges/1-21.htm">Judges 1:21-36</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-2.htm">1 Chronicles 22:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-18</a>.

Whether it were the determining reason or not in these two places, it is very imaginable that it would be of less importance in the ages of the post-Captivity annalist to dwell on the minutiae of the different treatment of the aliens.

This was the name of the son of Joktan (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25-29</a>), who, it is supposed, gave his name to the place or land in the south of Arabia. It is still quite an unsettled question, however, where Ophir was situated, though an Arabian situation is on every account the most probable (see Exposition <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-4.htm">1 Chronicles 29:4</a>; and Dr. Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 2:637-642).

Sheba</span>. This was the name of a descendant of Cush, a Hamite (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-7.htm">Genesis 10:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-9.htm">1 Chronicles 1:9</a>); also of a son of Joktan, a Shemite (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-28.htm">Genesis 10:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-22.htm">1 Chronicles 1:22</a>); also of a son of Jokshan, Abraham's son by Keturah (<a href="../../par/genesis/25-3.htm">Genesis 25:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-32.htm">1 Chronicles 1:32</a>). It is quite uncertain who of these constituted, or preponderated in, the country of Sheba here referred to. This is probably Saba, the capital of Yemen, an important province of Arabia, west of the Red Sea, north of the Indian Ocean, and extending upward nearly to Idumaea. The city was reputed splendid, the country wealthy, and long as the most southerly inhabited part of the world. If it were, as is believed, first occupied by Cushites it was afterwards peopled also by Joktanites and Jokahanites, as above. In addition- to the two celebrated allusions to it, ever memorable, see as other references, <a href="../../par/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/38-18.htm">Ezekiel 38:18</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/11-31.htm">Luke 11:31</a> (see also Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1232). The hard questions consisted in riddles (<a href="../../par/judges/14-2.htm">Judges 14:2</a>) and enigmas and primitive casuistry, in which the Arabians found some considerable portion of their mental gymnastics These, no doubt, bore some mild cousinly relationship to the proverbs and songs of Solomon, and his treasures of botanical and natural history facts (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Spices</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, here as also in the parallel. This word is used twenty-one times, and in a slightly varied form (as in the ninth verse of this same chapter) nine more times. It is almost always translated (Authorized Version) by this same word "spice" or "spices" (except <a href="../../par/exodus/30-23.htm">Exodus 30:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/2-12.htm">Esther 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>). There are other Hebrew words for "spices," such as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/37-25.htm">Genesis 37:25</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7</a>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<a href="../../par/songs/8-2.htm">Song of Solomon 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-10.htm">Ezekiel 24:10</a>); but the "spice" or "spices" designated by our present word, and the exact name or nature of which cannot be certainly pronounced upon, was in great request for domestic, ecclesiastical, funeral (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>), and other purposes, and was a chief export from Arabia, Syria, and Persia. <span class="cmt_word">Gold in abundance</span>. Of course, it is not necessary to suppose that the gold that came either now from Sheba, or even from Ophir, was obtained from the immediate region; as seen before, there may have been a special market or emporium for them there<span class="cmt_word">. Precious stones</span>. These were used for sacred purposes, and for domestic and dress ornaments, and were graven upon in early times by the Hebrews The chief of those mentioned in the Old Testament are the carbuncle, sardius, topaz (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-10.htm">Exodus 39:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), diamond, emerald, sapphire (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-11.htm">Exodus 39:11</a>); <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), agate, amethyst, ligure (<a href="../../par/exodus/39-12.htm">Exodus 39:12</a>), beryl, jasper, onyx (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-12.htm">Genesis 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/39-6.htm">Exodus 39:6, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), ruby (<a href="../../par/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>), chrysolite, chrysoprasus (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>). The precious stones which the queen brought are likely enough, however, to have comprised other varieties (including the pearl from the Persian Gulf), such as Pliny describes; and see in particular <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-16.htm">Ezekiel 27:16</a>; and the art. "Stones, Precious," in Smith's 'Bible Dictionary,' 3:1382. <span class="cmt_word">All that was in her heart</span>. The expression simply <span class="cmt_word">means all that she had so desired to get information upon, since she had heard of the fame of Solomon.</span>

Translating our thoughts rather violently into modern language, we might picture the queen inspecting the <span class="accented">kitchens</span> of the palace, and remember that the kitchens of an Oriental court did the work, not of an individual "table," but of those of a very large domestic and official retinue; much more these of Solomon now. Keil and Bertheau, however, with others, refer this expression to the set-out of one meal-table (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> that of a modern banquet, wedding breakfast, or the like), where both the abounding lading of the table and the ample variety of the courses, and the rich foreign or home fruits, in season or out of season, and the furnishing and decorating of the table, all come in to add their contribution of effect; and they quote not inaptly our ver. 20, elucidated by <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-21.htm">1 Kings 10:21</a>. This was a daily glory with Solomon's palace-establishment. The immediate connection and the contents of this verse, though difficult, favour this direction of explanation, as will be seen in the succeeding clauses. <span class="cmt_word">The sitting of his servants</span>. The word here used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) occurs forty-three times, and is rendered in the Authorized Version thirty-two of these times as "habitation" or "dwelling." Of the remaining eleven times, one or other of those words would be almost the synonym of the word used, and in every ease the rendering "dwelling," if kept to the general idea of a dwelling or resting-place more or less <span class="accented">temporary</span>, would not be inappropriate or inconsistent with the evident drift of the connection; only here and in the parallel is the inconvenient rendering "sitting" adopted by the Authorized Version. Hence we disagree with Professor Dr. Murphy's explanation, <span class="accented">the sitting, i.e.</span> "in council of his chief officers." What the nature of the <span class="accented">location</span> (to use a term least specific) of the servants pointed to here is, nevertheless, still not quite clear. It is evidently placed in some antithesis with the <span class="accented">standing</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the standing-place) here rendered 'inadequately or incorrectly, <span class="cmt_word">the attendance of his ministers</span>. <span class="accented">The attendance, i.e.</span> "the station (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>) (see the four other occurrences of this' word: <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-28.htm">1 Chronicles 23:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-19.htm">Isaiah 22:19</a>). <span class="accented">Of his ministers</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, participle of a piel verb, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>. This word, in an amazing majority of the hundred occurrences of it, expresses ministry of <span class="accented">sacred</span> service of some kind. It may, indeed, be said that the present passage, with only one or two others, are doubtful in this meaning or character of explanation. To our next clause, referring to <span class="cmt_word">their apparel</span>, we find in the parallel mention, as here, of the <span class="cmt_word">cupbearers</span>, though the matter of <span class="accented">their</span> apparel is not included as it is here. Part of the difficulty of the verse arises from the consideration that up to this point the contents of the successive clauses of it may compose possibly enough a sharp graphic description of the daily banquet scene. An apt reference to similar description of Arabian banquets is given in the 'Speaker's Commentary ' as to be found in vol. it. pp. 213-215 of 'Ancient Monarchies.' Our next clause, however, brings us back into difficulty by its reference to Solomon's <span class="cmt_word">ascent</span> by <span class="cmt_word">which he went up into the house of the Lord</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a> with our Exposition, 'Pulpit Commentary'), apparently so unseasonably; nor are we much helped by reading, with the Septuagint, "the burnt offerings which he offered at the house of the Lord." The obscurity and lack of coherence are not formidable, indeed, and perhaps may be with moderate satisfaction set down again to the account of the occasionally careless selection of the compilers from the material of the older work. Possibly the allusion in our ver. 11 to the <span class="accented">terraces</span>, or stairs, or highways (see margin) to "the house of the Lord," <span class="accented">and to the king's palace</span>, may hold some clue to the <span class="accented">ascent</span> being adverted to here.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-9.htm">2 Chronicles 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and twenty talents of gold</span>. Putting the value of gold at &pound;4 per ounce, the value of one talent would be &pound;5476, making a total of &pound;657,120. Poole makes it &pound;1,250,000; S. Clarke, f 720,000. From our vers. 13, 14 we learn that in one year Solomon received 666 talents, beside what merchants brought. <span class="cmt_word">Any such spice</span>. The parallel has "no more such abundance of spices," and "of spices very great store." The Arabian spices, and their land and even sea borne fragrance, as also the very lucrative trade they created, are often alluded to by historians (see, among many others, Herod., 3:113; Diod., 3:46; Strabo, 16:4, &sect; 19). Much of all this so-termed <span class="accented">giving</span> was evidently matter of <span class="accented">exchange</span>. The queen got <span class="accented">quid pro quo</span>, while ver. 13 of the parallel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10</a>.) seems to speak of the other truer giving.

There are some slight indications pointing to this, and the meaning is perhaps that the terraces, balustrades, stairs (which possibly is the idea in the "ascent," ver. 4), pillars, etc., made of the wood which Hiram's and Solomon's servants had <span class="accented">formerly</span> brought with gold, were the artificial-work wonders which helped to astound the queen. <span class="cmt_word">Terraces to the house of the Lord, and to the king's palace</span>. These so rendered <span class="accented">terraces</span> were probably stairs, and, as already intimated, may have composed the "ascent" (ver. 4), and explain the mention of it in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">The algum trees.</span> This is the Hebrew text order of the <span class="accented">lamed</span> and <span class="accented">gimel</span> alphabet characters, as the Authorized Version order in the parallel <span class="accented">almug</span> is also the order of its Hebrew. The tree is mentioned only six times - three times in Chronicles (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-10.htm">2 Chronicles 9:10, 11</a>) and three times in Kings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-11.htm">1 Kings 10:11, 12</a>). Apparently this wood did grow in Lebanon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-8.htm">2 Chronicles 2:8</a>), though we think this not certain. Kimchi thinks it was the bukkum (Arabic word), which Europeans call Brazil wood, and which (Keil) was found in Ethiopia, as well as India. Some think it the sandal-wood of Malabar. Whatever it was, it no doubt was to be purchased at the emporium of Ophir. The intrinsic nature of the wood, and its intrinsically valuable nature, may easily be inferred from its use for the woodwork and sounding-board woodwork of musical instruments like the <span class="accented">harp</span> and <span class="accented">psaltery.</span> This fact would much incline to the view that the <span class="accented">red</span> sandal-wood is what is here called algum. The 'Speaker's Commentary' quotes Max Muller ('Lectures on Language,' 1st series, p. 191) for the statement that the vernacular for this wood in India is <span class="accented">valguka</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Harps...  psalteries</span> (see our Exposition on 2 Chronicles 5:12, and articles in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' and others. The sentence, <span class="cmt_word">there were none such seen in the land of Judah,</span> may Be read as an indication that they had been part of the exhibition made to the Queen of Sheba.

The parallel has not this obscure clause, but has, "beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal Bounty." Professor Dr. Murphy explains our clause as purporting to say this: Solomon gave all the queen's desire in the way of bounty, "beside" all that belonged as an equivalent for "what she had brought." She got so much sheer gift, beside all that, according to the then Eastern custom, was her due.

It is used of a ruler in the Assyrian empire (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-24.htm">2 Kings 18:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-9.htm">Isaiah 36:9</a>), in the Chaldean (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a>), in the Persian (<a href="../../par/esther/8-9.htm">Esther 8:9</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/9-3.htm">Esther 9:3</a>), specially of the Persian governor of Judaea (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/haggai/2-2.htm">Haggai 2:2, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/12-26.htm">Nehemiah 12:26</a>; <a href="../../par/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>); while Gesenius reads this passage in our present text and its parallel, to speak of governors of <span class="accented">Judaea</span> (<span class="cmt_word">the</span> <span class="cmt_word">country</span>). See also <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-24.htm">1 Kings 20:24</a>, where the word is translated (Authorized Version) "captains," and is in the Syrian king's mouth. The word is not used before Kings. It is used by the writer of Kings three times; of Chronicles, once; by Ezra, six times; in Nehemiah, eight times; in Esther, three times; in Daniel, four times; and in the remaining prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Haggai, Malachi, ten times in all. The Authorized Version, out of the whole number of these occurrences of the word, has rendered it "captains" thirteen times; "deputies," twice; and "governors," twenty times. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-15.htm">2 Chronicles 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">And king Solomon made two hundred targets <i>of</i> beaten gold: six hundred <i>shekels</i> of beaten gold went to one target.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Targets...  shields</span>. The Authorized Version "target" is unfortunate, though it may with somewhat grim truth represent fact. It was a very large solid shield, originally made of some common material, as basketwork or wood, and covered with leather; <span class="accented">these</span> with a plate of gold. The absence of the word "shekel" in each clause, both here and in Kings, leaves it open to us to suppose that the <span class="accented">beka</span>, or <span class="accented">half-</span>shekel, may be the right word. Now, the <span class="accented">maneh</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>), or pound, meant 100 bekas, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> 50 shekels. Thus the targets, or shields, had six manehs of gold to their plating each, and the lesser <span class="accented">bucklers</span> (as we may perhaps call them) three manehs each. On the estimate that the shekel weighed 9 dwt. 3 gr., since the maneh weighed fifty shekels (100 <span class="accented">bekas</span>, or half-shekels), the gold to a shield (target) may be put at something over 11 lbs. troy. <span class="cmt_word">The house of the forest of Lebanon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an armoury (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>).

The parallel adds that "the top of the throne was round behind" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-19.htm">1 Kings 10:19</a>). Comparing also the two accounts, it would appear that there were twelve lions on each side of the throne, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> two to each step. When it is said that <span class="cmt_word">there were two lions standing by the stays</span> (or, <span class="accented">arms</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>on each side of</span> the sitting-place, we may easily imagine, from ancient modelled thrones, that of them the arms were themselves "no small part." It is remarkable that the parallel does not take cognizance of the footstool. The lion is, of course, as natural a symbol as it is an old one of sovereign power and place; and the use of the lion and the number of them, reminding of the tribes of Israel, were specifically justified to the people, whose oracles contained such words as those in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>. Josephus tells us that a golden bull supported the seat of the throne. If so, it is remarkable that the statement should be omitted in both of our Old Testament narrations. The dimensions of the throne we might have looked for, but they are not given. That they were well proportioned to the height, marked by six steps, may be taken for granted.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - To Tarshish. The parallel has, in both clauses of its verse (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-22.htm">1 Kings 10:22</a>), "ships <span class="accented">of</span> Tarshish." The order of the words in the former clause of our present verse, that compels us to read, "going to Tarshish," certifies the correct meaning. The word "Tarshish" (the subsequent <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>) covered a district in South Spain, as well as named a town and river, and stretched opposite the coast of Africa. Both coasts were beneath Phoenician rule, and a voyage to Tarshish would most naturally mean calling at many a port, and many an African port, from one and another of which all the imports here spoken of would be obtainable. The meaning of the Hebrew root of Tarshish is "to subjugate." The town lay between the two mouths of the river Baetis, now Guadal-quiver. Gesenius thinks that the writer of Chronicles says, in ignorance, "to Tarshish." and that the ships went to Ophir! These passages do not say that the voyage, whatever it was, took three years; much less that that length of time was necessary. Whether voyages were in Solomon's time made <span class="accented">from</span> the Red Sea, circumnavigating Africa, into the Mediterranean, is not certain. If they were such voyages, taken at a sauntering pace, with calls at many ports and easygoing delays, they may easily have consumed as long a space of time as three years! The theory that Tarshish was Tarsus in Cilicia is easily and conclusively negatived. The names in Hebrew of "ivory, apes, and peacocks" have been said to be of Indian origin. This is far from proved, and, as regards the first two, may be said to be sufficiently disproved. But if it all were so, still the fact that the Hebrew names were of an Indian language derivation would go very short way to prove that the Hebrew people got the things represented by them direct, or at all, from India. <span class="cmt_word">Ivory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The Authorized Version rendering "ivory" occurs ten times in the Old Testament, having for its original the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-39.htm">1 Kings 22:39</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-17.htm">2 Chronicles 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/45-8.htm">Psalm 45:8</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/5-14.htm">Song of Solomon 5:14</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/7-4.htm">Song of Solomon 7:4</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/3-15.htm">Amos 3:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>). In <span class="accented">all</span> these cases, two of them being in closest juxtaposition with the present and its parallel occasion, the word speaks of ivory that is being used, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as though it were manufactured material or ready for manufacture. But in our passage and its parallel, where the different word given above is found, it is manifest that it speaks of the material, so to say, in the rough, as just "tooth or tusk of ?;" but, further, what the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is is not yet ascertained. It is not a word known in the Hebrew vocabulary. Gesenius finds the Sanscrit <span class="accented">ibhas</span>, which signifies an "elephant;" Canon Rawlinsen finds in some Assyrian inscriptions a word <span class="accented">habba</span>, used of both elephant and camel, but probably having for its generic signification "a great animal;" Keil (on the parallel) finds a Coptic word, <span class="accented">eboy</span>, the Latin <span class="accented">elephas</span>, to which he prefixes the Hebrew article <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>. The Targum Jonathan shows at once <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>. Gesenius, in his 'Thesaurus,' calls also timely attention to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15</a>, where we read, "They brought thee a present, horns of ivory <span class="accented">and</span> ebony" (Hebrew, Chethiv, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>; Keri, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). But no use of "ebony" happens to be mentioned in the connection of our present passages or subject. Thus it will be seen that no little ingenuity has been employed to hunt down this little word, though as yet not quite successfully. More may be seen in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 1:906. <span class="cmt_word">Apes</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' 2nd edit., p. 390) says, "This word is identical with the name of the <span class="accented">monkey</span> in <span class="accented">Tamil."</span> Keil connects it with the Sanscrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>, but does not believe, with Gesenius, that the animal came from India, but Ethiopia. In a valuable note in the' Speaker's Commentary' we read, "It is found" (not stated <span class="accented">where</span>) "that the word was an Egyptian word, signifying a kind of monkey, in use in the time of Thothmes II., <span class="accented">i.e.</span> about the time of the Israelites' exodus." (For Herodotus's testimony respecting ivory and apes in North Africa, see his 'Hist.,' 4:91.) <span class="cmt_word">Peacocks</span>; Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Conder ('Handbook to the Bible,' p. 393') says a Tamil word, <span class="accented">tokei</span>, means "peacock." Keil proposes to consider it one of the later Romans' luxurious delicacies, <span class="accented">aves Numidicae</span>, from Tuoca, a town in Mauretania or Numi-alia. Some translate it "guinea-fowl," and some "parrots." The peacock did not belong to Africa, yet still it may have been purchaseable at some port there.
