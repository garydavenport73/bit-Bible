In continuance of the same lesson, he teaches them historically that the possession of great privileges is no safeguard, and that the seductions, even of idolatry, must not be carelessly despised. Although the connection of the various paragraphs is not stated with logical precision, we see that they all bear on the one truth which he wants to inculcate, namely, that it is both wise and kind to limit our personal freedom out of sympathy with others. The reading "but" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, morever) is probably a correction of the true reading (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, for), due to the failure to understand the whole train of thought. <span class="cmt_word">I would not that ye should be ignorant.</span> This is a favourite phrase of St. Paul's (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). The ignorance to which he refers is not ignorance of the facts, but of the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the facts. <span class="cmt_word">All our fathers.</span> He repeats the "all" five times, because he wishes to show that, though "all" partook of spiritual blessings, most (ver. 5) fell in spite of them. He says, "our fathers," not only because he was himself a Jew, but also because the patriarchs and the Israelites were spiritually the fathers of the Christian Church. <span class="cmt_word">Were under the cloud.</span> The compressed Greek phrase implies that they <span class="accented">went</span> under it, and remained under its shadow. The "cloud" is the "pillar of cloud" (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>), of which David says, "He spread a cloud <span class="accented">for a covering"</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/105-39.htm">Psalm 105:39</a>).

The passing under the cloud (<a href="../../par/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19</a>) and through the sea, constituting as it did their deliverance from bondage into freedom, their death to Egypt, and their birth to a new covenant, was a general type or dim shadow of Christian baptism (compare our collect, "figuring thereby thy holy baptism").

The manna might be called "a spiritual food," both because it was "angels' food" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>; Wisd. 16:20) and "bread from heaven" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-24.htm">Psalm 78:24</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31</a>), and also because it was a type of "God's good Spirit," which he "gave to instruct them" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-20.htm">Nehemiah 9:20</a>). St. Paul only knows of <span class="accented">two</span> sacraments. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same spiritual drink.</span> The water from the smitten rock might (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-11.htm">Numbers 20:11</a>) be called a "spiritual" drink, both as being a miraculous gift (comp. <a href="../../par/galatians/4-29.htm">Galatians 4:29</a>, where Isaac is said to be "born <span class="accented">after the spirit"</span>), and as being a type of that "living water" which "springs up into everlasting life" (<a href="../../par/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), and of the blood of Christ in the Eucharist (<a href="../../par/john/6-55.htm">John 6:55</a>). These "waters in the wilderness" and "rivers in the desert" were a natural symbol of the grace of God (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-23.htm">Isaiah 43:23</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>), especially as bestowed in the sacrament through material signs. <span class="cmt_word">They drank;</span> literally, <span class="accented">they were drinking</span>, implying a <span class="accented">continuous</span> gift. <span class="cmt_word">Of that spiritual Rock that followed them;</span> rather, literally, <span class="accented">of a spiritual following Rock.</span> This is explained <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a mere figure of speech, in which the natural rock which Moses smote is left out of sight altogether; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as meaning that not the rock, but the water from the rock, followed after them in their wanderings (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>). There can, however, be little or no doubt that St. Paul refers to the common Jewish Hagadah, that the actual material rock did follow the Israelites in their wanderings. The rabbis said that it was round, and rolled itself up like a swarm of bees, and that, when the tabernacle was pitched, this rock came and settled in its vestibule, and began to flow when the princes came to it and sang, "Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it" (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-17.htm">Numbers 21:17</a>). It does not, of course, follow from this allusion that St. Paul, or even the rabbis, believed their Hagadah <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">other than a metaphorical sense.</span> The Jewish Hagadoth - legends and illustrations and inferences of an imaginative Oriental people - are not to be taken <span class="accented">au pied de la lettre.</span> St. Paul obviates the laying of any stress on the mere legend by the qualifying word, "a <span class="accented">spiritual</span> Rock." <span class="cmt_word">And that Rock was Christ.</span> The writings of Philo, and the Alexandrian school of thought in general, had familiarized all Jewish readers with language of this kind. They were accustomed to see types of God, or of the Word (<span class="accented">Logos</span>), in almost every incident of the deliverance from Egypt and the wanderings in the wilderness. Thus in Wisd. 10:15 and Wisdom 11:4 it is Wisdom - another form of the <span class="accented">Logos</span> - who leads and supports the Israelites. The frequent comparison, of God to a Rock in the Old Testament (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>, etc.) would render the symbolism more easy, especially as in <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a> we find, "Behold, I [Jehovah] will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb."

But, in spite of Alford's decisive rejection of it, the rendering, "Now in these things they proved to be figures of us," is at least equally probable. To the intent. Of course, the events had their own immediate instruction, but the example which they involved was the ulterior purpose of their being so ordained by the providence of God. <span class="cmt_word">As they also lusted.</span> (For quails, <a href="../../par/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4, 33</a>; and see <a href="../../par/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7-11</a>.)

Another reading is "the Lord." "Christ" may have come in from a marginal gloss.

The last verse was a warning; this is an encouragement. Having just heard what efforts even St. Paul had to make to run in the Christian race, and how terribly their fathers in the wilderness had failed to meet the requirements of God, they might be inclined to throw up every effort in despair.

God is faithful He had called them (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>), and since he knew "how to deliver the godly out of temptations" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/2-9.htm">2 Peter 2:9</a>), he would surely perform his side of the covenant, and, if they did their parts, would stablish and keep them from evil (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>).

The rabbis decided very differently. "If," said Rabbi Ishmael, "an idolater makes a feast in honour of his son, and invites all the Jews of his town, they eat of the sacrifices of the dead, even though they eat and drink of their own" ('Avodah Zarah,' fol. 18, 1).

It will be seen how gross was the calumny which asserted that St. Paul taught men to be <span class="accented">indifferent</span> about eating things offered to idols. He only taught indifference in cases where idolatry could not be directly involved in the question. He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became <span class="accented">inherently tainted</span> by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr.

Another view of these clauses interprets them to mean "You should refrain because, by net doing so, you give occasion to others to judge you" - a rule which has been compared with <a href="../../par/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>, "Let not your good be evil spoken of." Whichever view be taken, it is clear that <span class="accented">theoretically</span> St. Paul sided with the views of the "strong," but <span class="accented">sympathetically</span> with those of the "weak." He pleaded for some concession to the scrupulosity of ever morbid consciences, he disapproved of a defiant, ostentatious, insulting liberalism. On the other hand, he discouraged the miserable micrology of a purblind and bigoted superstition, which exaggerated the importance of things external and indifferent. He desiderated more considerateness and self denial on the one side; and on the other, a more robust and instructed faith, he would always tolerate the scruples of the weak, but would not suffer either weakness or strength to develop itself into a vexatious tyranny.

Dishonoureth his head</span>. He dishonoureth his own head, which is as it were a sharer in the glory of Christ, who is Head of the whole Church. "We pray," says Tertullian, "with bare heads because we blush not." The Christian, being no longer a slave, but a son (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-7.htm">Galatians 4:7</a>), may claim his part in the glory of the eternal Son. The head was covered in <span class="accented">mourning</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13</a>), and the worship of the Christian is joyous.

Under this head must be classed the idle attempts to twist the word <span class="accented">exousia</span>, power, or authority, into some other reading - an attempt which may be set aside, because it is not sanctioned by a single manuscript. We may also dismiss the futile efforts to make <span class="accented">exousia</span> have any other primary meaning than "authority." The <span class="accented">context</span> shows that the word has here a <span class="accented">secondary</span> sense, and implies <span class="accented">some kind of covering.</span> The verse, therefore, points the same lessons as <a href="../../par/genesis/24-64.htm">Genesis 24:64, 65</a>. This much may be regarded as certain, and this view is adopted by the steadfast good sense of our English translators, both in the Authorized and Revised Versions. The only question worth asking is <span class="accented">why</span> the word <span class="accented">exousia</span> had come at Corinth, or in the Corinthian Church, to be used for "a veil," or "covering." The simplest answer is that just as the word "kingdom" in Greek may be used for "a crown" (comp. <span class="accented">regno</span> as the name of the pope's tiara), so "<span class="accented">authority"</span> may mean "<span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">sign of authority"</span> (Revised Version), or "a covering, in sign that she is under the power of her husband" (Authorized Version, margin). The margin of the Revised Version, "authority over her head," is a strange suggestion. Some have explained the word of <span class="accented">her own</span> true authority, which consists in accepting the rule of her husband; but it probably moans <span class="accented">a sign of her husband's authority over her.</span> Similarly the traveller Chardin says that in Persia the women wear a veil, in sign that they are "under subjection." If so, the best comment on the word may be found in the exquisite lines of Milton, which illustrate the passage in other ways also - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"She, as a vei1, down to the slender waist<br />Her unadorned golden tresses wore...<br />As the vine curves her tendrils, which implied<br />Subjection, but required with gentle sway,<br />And by her yielded, by him best received."</span> The fact that Callistratus twice uses <span class="accented">exousia</span> of "abundance of hair" is probably a mere coincidence, resembling the Irish expression "a power of hair." Nor can there be any allusion to the isolated fact that Samson's strength lay in his hair. The very brief comment of Luther sums up all the best of the many pages which have been written on the subject. He says that <span class="accented">exousia</span> means "the veil or covering, by which one may see that she is under her husband's authority" (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Because of the angels.</span> In this clause also we must set aside, as idle waste of time, the attempts to alter the text, or to twist the plain words into impossible meanings. The word "angels" cannot mean "Church officials," or "holy men," or "prophets," or "delegates," or "'bridegroom's men," or anything but angels. Nor can the verse mean, as Bengel supposes, that women are to veil themselves because the angels do so (<a href="../../par/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a>), or (as Augustine says) because the angels approve of it. The only question is whether the allusion is to good or bad angels. In favour of the latter view is<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph"></span> the universal tradition among the Jews that the angels fell by lust for mortal women, which was the Jewish way of interpreting <a href="../../par/genesis/6-1.htm">Genesis 6:1, 2</a>. This is the view of Tertullian ('De Virg. Vel.,' 7) in writing on this subject. A woman, in the opinion and traditions of Oriental Jews, is liable to injury from the <span class="accented">shedim</span>, if she appears in public unveiled; and these evil spirits are supposed to delight in the appearance of unveiled women. The objection to this view, that <span class="accented">angeloi</span> alone is never used of evil but always of good angels, is not perhaps decisive (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-3.htm">1 Corinthians 6:3</a>). The verse may, however, mean (in accordance with the Jewish belief of those days) that good angels, being under the possibility of falling from the same cause as their evil brethren, fly away at once from the presence of unveiled women. Thus Khadijah tested that the visitant of her husband Mohammed really was the angel Gabriel, because he disappeared the moment she unveiled her head. On the whole, however, the meaning seems to be, <span class="accented">out of respect and reverence for the holy angels, who are always invisibly present in the Christian assemblies.</span> (On this point, see <a href="../../par/luke/15-10.htm">Luke 15:10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-10.htm">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/5-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/138-1.htm">Psalm 138:1</a> [LXX.]; Tobit 12:12.

(It is better to use this technical word in order to dissipate the cloud of strange misconceptions as to the true nature of this <span class="accented">charism.</span>) So terrible an outrage on the conscience of Christians could never have passed unchecked and unpunished, except from the obvious inability of the young community to grapple with the new and perplexing phenomena of an "inspiration" which appeared to destroy the personal control of those possessed by it. Among Jewish converts glossolaly was regarded as a form of that wild mantle "inspiration" of which we find some traces in Jewish history (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23, 24</a>, etc.), and which was alluded to in the very name <span class="accented">Nabo</span>, which implied a boiling energy. Among Gentile converts the glossolaly would be classed with the overmastering influences of which they read, or which they witnessed, in the Sibyls, the Pythian priestesses, and the wild orgiastic devotees of Eastern cults. They would not like to call any one to task for things spoken in a condition which they regarded as wholly supernatural.

Similar phenomena - the same intrusions into worship of downright blasphemy or of blasphemous familiarity - have constantly recurred at times of overwhelming spiritual excitement, as for instance m the adherents of the "everlasting gospel" in the thirteenth century, and in various movements of our own day. <span class="accented">Is accursed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">is anathema.</span> The word corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="accented">cherem</span>, which means "a ban," and "what is devoted or set apart by a ban;" and to the Latin <span class="accented">sacer</span>, which means not only "sacred," set apart by holy consecration, but also "devoted to destruction." <span class="cmt_word">No man can say that Jesus is [the] Lord, but by [in] the Holy Ghost.</span> It involved a strong rebuke to the <span class="accented">illuminati</span>, who professed a profound spiritual insight, to tell them that no man could make the simple, humble confession of the divinity of Jesus (for "Lord" is here an equivalent of the Hebrew "Jehovah") except by the same inspiration as that which they so terribly abused. There is a very similar passage in <a href="../../par/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; but there the "test" of the inspiration is a confession of the humanity of Jesus as against Gnostics, who treated his human life as purely phantasmal.

There were such things as "deceitful spirits" which spoke "doctrines of devils" (l Timothy 4:1; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1, 2</a>; see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>). Divers kinds of tongues. There is no need for the word "divers." The particular variety of the ecstatic, and often entirely unintelligible, utterance known as "the tongue" differed with the individuality or temperament of the speaker. Recent lines of research, by that historical method which can alone furnish correct results, have led to the conclusion that, whatever may be thought of the "tongues" on the day of Pentecost (which is a separate question), the "tongue" spoken of (for the most part with <span class="accented">relative</span> disparagement) by St. Paul as a <span class="accented">charism</span> of the Spirit was closely analogous to that wild, rapt, unconscious, uncontrollable utterance which, with varying details, has always occurred in the religious movements which stir the human soul to its utmost depths. The attempts to explain the word "tongues" as meaning "foreign languages," or "the primeval language," or "poetic and unusual phraseology," etc., are baseless and exploded. The notion that by this gift the early Christians knew languages which they had never acquired, is not only opposed to the entire analogy of God's dealings, but to every allusion in the New Testament (except a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> but untenable view of the meaning of <a href="../../par/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>) and to every tradition and statement of early Christian history. The apostles (so far as we have any record of their missionary work in the New Testament) had not the slightest need to acquire foreign languages. Since Palestine was at this epoch bilingual, they could all speak Aramaic and Greek, and therefore could address Jews and Gentiles throughout the civilized world. Every single allusion which St. Paul makes to this subject excludes the possibility of the supposition of a miracle so utterly useless and meaningless, so subversive of every psychological consideration, and so alien from the analogy of all God's methods, as the talking in unacquired foreign languages by persons who did not understand them. <span class="cmt_word">The interpretation of tongues.</span> Sometimes, but not always (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-13.htm">1 Corinthians 14:13</a>), the speaker, on relapsing from his ecstasy, was able to express his outburst of unintelligible soliloquy in the form of reasoned thought When he was unable to do so, St. Paul ordains that another should convey in ordinary language the impressions left by the inspired rhapsody (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-27.htm">1 Corinthians 14:27-29</a>).

Would that it had received in all ages the loftier and more valuable admiration which would have been expressed by an acceptance of its lessons! Tertullian says that it is uttered "with all the force of the Spirit" (<span class="accented">totis Spiritus viribus</span>). It is a glorious hymn or paean in honour of Christian love, in which St. Paul rises on the wings of inspiration to the most sunlit heights of Christian eloquence. Like the forty-fifth psalm, it may be entitled "A Psalm of Love." Valcknaer says that the "oratorical figures which illuminate the chapter have been born spontaneously in an heroic soul, burning with the love of Christ, and placing all things lower than this Divine love." In vers. 1-3 he shows the absolute <span class="accented">necessity</span> for love; in vers. 4-7 its characteristics; in vers. 8-12 its eternal permanence; in ver. 13 its absolute supremacy. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels</span>. The case is merely <span class="accented">supposed.</span> The tongues of men are human languages, including, perhaps, the peculiar utterance of ecstatic inspiration with which he is now dealing. It is, perhaps, with reference to this latter result of spiritual exultation, at any rate in its purest and loftiest developments, that he adds the words, "and of angels." It is unlikely that he is referring to the rabbinic notion that the angels only understood Hebrew, and not Aramaic or other languages. The words are meant to express the greatest possible climax. The most supreme powers of utterance, even of angelic utterance - if any of the Corinthians had or imagined that they had attained to such utterance - are nothing in comparison with the universally possible attainment of Christian love. It is remarkable that here again he places "tongues," even in their grandest conceivable development, on the <span class="accented">lowest</span> step in his climax. <span class="cmt_word">And have not charity.</span> It is deeply to be regretted that the translators of the Authorized Version here introduced from the Vulgate a new translation for the sacred word "love," which dominates the whole New Testament as its Divine keynote. Greek possesses two words for "love." One of these, <span class="accented">eros</span>, implying as it did the love which springs from sensual passion, was dyed too deeply in pagan associations to be capable of redemption into holier usage. It is characteristic of the difference between paganism and Christianity, that Plato's eulogy in the 'Symposium' is in honour of <span class="accented">eros</span>, not of anything resembling <span class="accented">agape.</span> The apostles, therefore, were compelled to describe the ideal of the gospel life by another word, which expressed the love of esteem and reverence and sacred tenderness - the word <span class="accented">agape.</span> This word was not indeed classical. No heathen writer had used it. But the verb <span class="accented">agapao</span>, corresponding to the Latin <span class="accented">diligo</span>, and bring reserved for this loftier kind of love, suggested at once the substantive <span class="accented">agape</span>, which, together with the similar substantive <span class="accented">agapesis</span> (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-3.htm">Jeremiah 31:3</a>, etc.), had already been adopted by the LXX. and by Philo and in Wisd. 3:9. The word is thus, as Archbishop Trench says, "born in the bosom of revealed religion" ('New Testament Synonyms,' p. 41). The Vulgate chose <span class="accented">caritas</span> (whence our "charity") to express this love of reason and affection, the dearness which reigns between human beings, and between man and God. This word, like <span class="accented">agape</span>, is absolutely unstained with any evil association. If "charity" had been <span class="accented">exclusively</span> used for <span class="accented">agape</span>, no objection need have arisen, although "love" is English while "charity" is Latin. But it was an Unmixed evil that, by the use of two different words for the same Greek word, English readers should have been prevented from recognizing the unity of thought on this subject which prevails among all the books of the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-22.htm">1 Peter 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7, 8</a>, etc.). To argue that the word "love" in English is not unmingled with unhallowed uses is absurd, because those uses of the word have never been supposed for a single moment to intrude into multitudes of other passages where love is used to render <span class="accented">agape.</span> Who has ever dreamed of objecting on such grounds to the favourite hymn? - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Faith and Hope and Love we see<br />Joining hand in hand agree;<br />But the greatest of the three<br />And the best is Love."</span> It is true that Lord Bacon admired "the discretion and tenderness of the Rhenish Version" in using the word "charitie," "because of the indifferencies and equivocation of the word [love] with impure love." But that objection, if it ever existed, has now been done away with by the use of "love" in such a multitude of other pure and lofty passages of Holy Writ. It is, therefore, a great gain that the Revised Version restored to this passage the word "love," which had been used by Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva Bible. For in modern English usage the word "charity" is almost confined to "almsgiving," and that of a kind which is often made an excuse for shirking all real self denial, and for <span class="accented">not</span> acting up to the true spirit of love. Christian love is always and infinitely blessed, but the almsgiving which has usurped the name of "charity" often does more harm than good. <span class="cmt_word">I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal;</span> more literally, <span class="accented">I have become booming brass, or clanging cymbal.</span> My "tongues" without "love" become a mere discordant, obtrusive, unintelligible dissonance. The Greek word for "clanging" (<span class="accented">alalazon</span>) is an onomatopoeia, like the Hebrew name for cymbals, <span class="accented">tseltselim</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/150-5.htm">Psalm 150:5</a>).

The power of lofty utterance belonged to Balaam and Caiaphas; yet it availed them nothing without love.

It is, however, much more probable that, if St. Paul derived the words from our Lord, they came to him by oral tradition. And the inference must in any case be precarious, for the phrase was so common among the rabbis that "remover of mountains" was one of their admiring titles for a great teacher<span class="cmt_word">.

It is derived from <span class="accented">psomion</span>, a mouthful, and so means "give away by mouthfuls," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">dole</span> away." It occurs in <a href="../../par/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> for "feed." Attention to this verse might have served as a warning against the often useless and sometimes even pernicious doles of mediaeval monasteries. Much of the "charity" of these days is even more uncharitable than this, and shows the most complete absence of true charity; as for instance the dropping of pennies to professional beggars, and so putting a premium on vice and imposture. <span class="cmt_word">To be burned</span>. The reading is extremely uncertain. The change of a letter gives the reading, <span class="accented">that I may glory</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Perhaps the scribes thought that "death by burning" was as yet (A.D. 57) an unheard of form of martyrdom, though it became but too familiar ten or twelve years later in the Neronian persecution. St. Paul was, however, probably referring, not, as some have supposed, to <span class="accented">branding</span>, which would bare been expressed differently, but to the case of the "three children," in <a href="../../par/daniel/3-23.htm">Daniel 3:23</a>, where the LXX. has, "They gave their bodies <span class="accented">into the fire</span>;" or to the various tortures and deaths by fire in 2 Macc. 7. At the burning of Ridley and Latimer, Dr. Smith chose this verse for his text. Its applicability is on a par with millions of other instances in which Scripture has been grossly abused by employing its letter to murder its spirit, and by taking it from the God of love to give it to the devil of religious hatred. The burning of a saint was a singular specimen of the Church's "love." <span class="cmt_word">It profiteth me nothing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">I am nothing benefited.</span> A consideration of this verse might have shown the Christians of the early centuries that there was nothing <span class="accented">intrinsically</span> redemptive in the martyrdom into which they often thrust themselves.

But, as St. Chrysostom says, "As a spark which falls into the sea hurts not the sea, but is itself extinguished, so an evil thing befalling a loving soul will be extinguished without disquietude." Thinketh no evil; literally, <span class="accented">doth not reckon</span> (or, <span class="accented">impute</span>) <span class="accented">the evil.</span> The phrase seems to be a very comprehensive one, implying that love is neither suspicious, nor implacable, nor retentive in her memory of evil done.

Probably it is this word, not found in the original, which has given rise to the perplexing, unhistoric, and unwarranted theory that "the gift of tongues" was a power of speaking in foreign languages. <span class="cmt_word">Speaketh not unto men</span>. Because, as a rule, no one understands anything that he says. The word literally means "hears." It may, perhaps, imply that no special attention was given to those who gave way to these impulses of utterance. The whole of this chapter proves in a most striking way the close analogy between "the tongue" and the impassioned soliloquies of inarticulate utterance which were poured forth in tones of thrilling power among the Montanists, and in modern times among the Irvingites. <span class="cmt_word">In the spirit.</span> It is uncertain whether this means "in his own spirit," or "in the Spirit of God," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a result of inspiration. Probably the former (<a href="../../par/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>, etc.). Perhaps, however, the two imply the same thing. The spirit is the one Divine part of our human being, and when a man is a true Christian his spirit is in union with, is as it were lost in, the Spirit of God. St. Paul recognizes the true tongue - for it might be <span class="accented">simulated</span> by hysteria and even by mere physical imposture - as a result of inspiration, that is, of the overpowering dominance of the human spirit by a supernatural power. Nevertheless, he points out the extreme peril of yielding to or self inducing these emotions public, or in leaving them uncontrolled. <span class="cmt_word">Mysteries.</span> Secrets revealed possibly to him, but unrevealed by this strange "tongue" to others.

His words build up the Christian soul, by rousing its efforts and consoling its sorrows. The "Son of prophecy" (Barnabas) is, as Stanley points out, also "a Son of consolation" (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>). "Support" (<span class="accented">paraklesis</span>) involves "comfort," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> strength and calm.

Yet it is perfectly intelligible. Montanus truly said that each human spirit is like a harp, which the Holy Spirit strikes as with a <span class="accented">plectrum</span>, and which yields itself to the mighty hand by which the chords are swept. We have seen all along - and history has in various ages confirmed the impression, on every occasion when these phenomena have been reproduced in seasons of great spiritual revival - that the external <span class="accented">symptoms</span> may be imitated with most dangerous and objectionable results both to the speaker and to others. But when the expression is <span class="accented">genuine</span>, the fact that the tides of the Spirit can thus sweep through the narrow channels of individuality is in itself a sign that the spirit of the man is alive and not dead; and thus he is an evidence of God's power both to himself and to others. Those who have heard "the tongue" have told me that its force, melody, and penetrative quality produced an impression not to be forgotten. When we see the stuffed and stopped-up hearts and lives of thousands of frivolous and worldly money worshippers, we might well echo St. Paul's wish. <span class="cmt_word">Greater</span>. Not of necessity greater absolutely or morally, but greater in the fact of his wider and deeper usefulness. <span class="cmt_word">Except he interpret.</span> From this we infer that sometimes, when the passion had spent its force, the speaker in the tongue could give rational explanation of the thoughts and feelings to which he had given ecstatic utterance.

Now, in that passage Isaiah tells the drunken priests, who scornfully imitated his style, that, since they derided God's message so delivered to them, God would address them in a very different way by the Assyrians, whose language they did not understand; and that even to <span class="accented">this</span> stern lesson, taught them by people of alien tongue, they would remain deaf. In the original, therefore, there is not the least allusion to any phenomenon resembling the "gift of tongues." But the mere <span class="accented">words</span> of a scriptural passage always came to Jews with all the force of an argument, independently of their primary meaning; and it was enough for St. Paul's purpose that in Isaiah the allusion is to unintelligible utterance, and to the fact that the teaching which it was meant to convey would be in vain. And other lips. St. Paul does not quote the LXX. The Hebrew has "with stammerings of lips and another tongue will he speak" (comp. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>).

Thus the address of St. Peter pierced the consciences of his hearers, when the glossolaly even of Pentecost produced no effect beyond that of irreverent wonder (<a href="../../par/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>). It is easy to see that the style and method of worship in the assemblies of Christians at this early epoch resembled that now prevalent among Quakers. The teaching was not left to recognized pastors, but any Christian might speak who had gifts which moved him to address his brethren. The externals of worship are of no eternal signifiance, but are best left to be moulded by the requirements of time and place, with reference to the teachings of past experience. No doubt St. Paul's depreciation of glossolaly led to its rapid disappearance when it had done its work of being "a sign to unbelievers." But if ancient modes of worship were too independent of rigid conditions, modern modes are, on the other hand, too stereotyped and inelastic.

The "James" intended is undoubtedly the only James then living, who was known to the whole Christian Church, namely, "the Lord's brother," the author of the Epistle, and the Bishop of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-13.htm">Acts 15:13</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>). James the son of Zebedee had by this time been martyred, and James the son of Alphaeus was never much more than a name to the Church in general. There is no mention of this appearance in the Gospel; but in the Gospel of the Hebrews was a curious legend (preserved in St. Jerome, 'De Virr. Illust.,' 2.) that James had made a vow that he would neither eat nor drink till he had seen Jesus risen from the dead, and that Jesus, appearing to him, said, "My brother, eat thy bread, for the Son of man is risen from the dead." The truth of the appearance is strongly supported by the fact that James, like the rest of the Lord's "brothers," "did not believe" in Christ before the Crucifixion, whereas <span class="accented">after the Resurrection</span> we find him and the rest of "the Lord's brothers" ardently convinced (<a href="../../par/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3-5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>, etc.). Of all the apostles (<a href="../../par/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>). James the Lord's brother was only an apostle in the wider sense of the word.

This and the next verse are an explanation of the strong and strange term which he had applied to himself. <span class="cmt_word">The least of the apostles.</span> In St. Paul there was a true and most deep humility, but no mock modesty. He knew the special gifts which he had received from God. He was well aware that to him had been entrusted the ten talents rather than the one talent. He could appeal to far vaster results than had been achieved by the work of any other apostle. He knew his own importance as "a chosen vessel," a special instrument in God's hands to work out exceptional results. But <span class="accented">in himself</span> he always felt, and did not shrink from confessing, that he was "nothing" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11</a>).

In <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a> he goes further, and calls himself "less than the least of all saints," though even there he claims to have been the special apostle of the Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">Because I persecuted the Church of God.</span> This was the one sin for which, though he knew that God had forgiven him (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-13.htm">1 Timothy 1:13</a>), yet he could never quite forgive himself (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>). In my 'Life of St. Paul' I have shown from the language used, that this persecution was probably more deadly than has been usually supposed, involving not only torture, but actual bloodshed (<a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1</a>), besides the martyrdom of St. Stephen.

The other, which is used here, is "we proclaim," or "herald" (<span class="accented">kerusso</span>), and refers to the statement of the facts of the gospel - Christ crucified and risen (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-2.htm">1 Corinthians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-2.htm">Acts 4:2</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>).

The fact at once proves two remarkable truths, namely, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the early Christian Church had none of the ideal purity of doctrine which is sometimes ecclesiastically attributed to it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there was in the bosom of that Church a wide and most forbearing tolerance. We have no data to enable us to determine what were the influences which led to the denial of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> They can hardly have been Jewish. The mass of Jews at this time shared the views of the Pharisees, who strongly maintained the resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>). If they were Jews at all, they could only have been Sadducees or Essenes. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the <span class="accented">Sadducees</span> were a small, wealthy, and mainly political sect, who had no religious influence, and can certainly have had no representatives at Corinth; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the <span class="accented">Essenes</span>, though they had considerable influence in Asia, do not seem to have established themselves in Greece, nor are we aware that they were hostile to the doctrine of the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Probably, then, they were Gentiles. If so, they may have been <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> either <span class="accented">Epicureans</span>, who disbelieved in a future life altogether; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">Stoics</span>, who held that the future life was only an impersonal absorption into the Divine. Both these schools of philosophers "jeered" at the very notion of a bodily resurrection (<a href="../../par/acts/17-32.htm">Acts 17:32</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-18.htm">2 Timothy 2:18</a> we read of some, like Hymenaeus and Philetus, who erred, saying "that the resurrection was past already." These teachers were incipient Gnostics, who <span class="accented">spiritualized</span> the resurrection, or rather said that the term was <span class="accented">only</span> applicable to the rising from the death of sin to the life of righteousness. The Corinthian doubters seem from the arguments which St. Paul addresses to them, to have been rather troubled with <span class="accented">material</span> doubts which they may have inherited from their Gentile training.

The attempts to explain them have usually been nothing but ingenious methods of explaining them away. Of these the one usually adopted by the Fathers is the limitation of the statement to Christ's human nature (<a href="../../par/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26, 27, 30</a>) and mediatorial kingdom, just as we find in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-3.htm">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>. The head of Christ is God." We can easily "darken counsel by words without knowledge" in dealing with this subject, and hide an absolute ignorance under a semblance of knowledge; but anything and everything which we can say in "explanation" of this self subjection of the Son to the Father is simply involved in the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">That God may be all in all.</span> "All things in all things" or "all things in all men." The words involve a complete and absolute supremacy. It is quite an easy matter for commentators to say that the scope of the words "must be confined to believers," if they chose to make "all" mean "some." Such methods often lead to an irreligious religionism and a heterodox orthodoxy. The reader will find the same phrase in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-11.htm">Colossians 3:11</a>. I confine myself to the comment of the profound and saintly Bengel: "There is implied something new, but also supreme and eternal. All things, and therefore all men, without any interruption, no created thing claiming a place, no enemy creating opposition, shall be subordinated to the Son, the Son to the Father. All things shall say, 'God is all things to me.' This is the consummation; this the end and summit. Further than this not even an apostle can go." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a></div><div class="verse">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-34.</span> - <span class="accented">Arguments from the practices and lives of Christians.</span> The three arguments used in these verses are: If there be no resurrection: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Why do some of you get yourselves baptized on behalf of your dead friends? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Why do we face lives of daily peril? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> How would it be otherwise possible to resist Epicurean views of life? <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead,</span> etc.? This clause can have but one meaning, and that its obvious one, namely, that, among the many strange opinions and practices which then prevailed, was one which was entirely un-warranted-but which St. Paul does not here stop to examine - of persons getting themselves baptized as it were by <span class="accented">proxy</span> for others who had died. Doubtless some of the deaths alluded to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> had happened to persons who had been cut off before they were actually baptized; and their friends had as it were gone through the rite <span class="accented">in their stead</span>, in the hope of extending to them some of its benefits. It is argued that St. Paul could not possibly mention such a practice without reprobation; but that is an <span class="accented">a priori</span> assumption not warranted by St. Paul's methods (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-6.htm">1 Corinthians 11:6</a>). He always confines his attention to the question immediately before him, and his present object is merely to urge a passing <span class="accented">argumentum ad hominem.</span> There is nothing at all surprising in the existence of such an abuse in the medley of wild opinions and wild practices observable in this disorganized Church. It accords with the known tendency of later times to postpone baptism, as a rite which was supposed to work as a charm. We also find that the actual practice of baptism on behalf of the dead lingered on among Corinthians (Epiph., 'Haer.,' 28:7) and Marcionites (Tertullian, 'De Resurrect.,' 48; 'Adv. Marc.,' 5:10). Tertullian accepts the words in their obvious sense in his 'De Praeser. Haer.,' 48, but accepts the absurdity of "the dead" meaning "the body" ("pro mortuis tingui est pro corporibus tingui") in his book against Marcion (5:10). St. Chrysostom tells us further that the proxy who was to be baptized used to be concealed under the bier of the dead man, who was supposed to answer in his name that he desired to be baptized. How perfectly natural the custom was may be seen from the fact that among the Jews also a man dying under ceremonial pollution was cleansed by proxy. The "interpretations" of this verse are so numerous that it is not even possible to give a catalogue of them. Many of them are not worth recording, and are only worth alluding to at all as specimens of the wilful bias which goes to Scripture, not to seek truth, but to support tradition. They are mostly futile and fantastic, because they pervert the plain meaning of the plain words. It is a waste of time and space to give perpetuity to baseless fancies. Such are the notions that "for the dead" can mean "for our mortal bodies" (Chrysostom); or "for those about to die" (Estius, Calvin, etc.); or "over (the sepulchres of) the dead" (Luther); or "to supply the vacancies left by the dead" (Le Clerc, etc.). Equally unwarrantable are the "explanations" (?) which make those who are being "baptized" mean those who are "passing through a baptism of suffering" (!). Not a single argument which is worth a moment's consideration can be urged in favour of any one of these, or scores of similar views. If we are to get rid of everything that is surprising on the ground that it is "immensely improbable," we may as well discard Scripture at once, and reconstruct early Christian history out of our own consciousness. It has been very usual to represent it as we think that it ought to have been, and not as it was. The disuse of this vicarious baptism among orthodox Christians may have been due to the discouragement of it by St. Paul when he went to Corinth, and "set in order" various erroneous customs (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-34.htm">1 Corinthians 11:34</a>).

The metaphor is not uncommon. Thus in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-17.htm">2 Timothy 4:17</a> St. Paul alludes to Nero (probably) as "the lion." David often compares his enemies to wild beasts (<a href="../../par/psalms/22-21.htm">Psalm 22:21</a>, etc.). When his jailor informed Agrippa of the death of Tiberius, he did so in the words, "The lion is dead." St. Ignatius writes of the ten soldiers who were conducting him to Rome as "ten leopards." Epimenides, in the line quoted by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>, spoke of the Cretans as "evil wild beasts," and the pseudo-Heraclitus gives this same uncomplimentary title to these very Ephesians. <span class="cmt_word">Let as eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.</span> Perhaps the "if the dead are not raised" belongs to this clause. He means that such an Epicurean maxim, if never <span class="accented">excusable</span>, would at least be <span class="accented">natural</span>, if men could only look to life in the present. The sentiment is found on the lips of the despairing and the sensual alike in <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>, and in the writings of the heathen (Horace, 'Od.,' 1:4, 13-17, etc.). St. Paul would be all the more familiar with it because it formed the infamous epitaph of a statue of Sardauapalus, which he must have often seen in his boyhood at Anchiale, near Tarsus. It represented the debased king as snapping his fingers, and using almost these very words. It is strange that similar passages should be found even in the Talmud. Shemuel said to Rav Yehudah, "Seize and eat, seize and drink; for the world is like a wedding feast (soon over)" ('Eiruvin,' fol. 54, 1).

More accurately it means "evil associations corrupt excellent morals."

It is just such a line as he might have seen carved on the Hermae of any Greek town, or preserved in any chrestomathy or gnomology which may have chanced to pass through his hands. His other classic quotations (from Epimenides, <a href="../../par/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>; and Aratus or Cleanthes, <a href="../../par/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a>) are of the same common and proverbial character. It is very unlikely that he would have deliberately quoted from the immoral play of a corrupt comedian like Menander.

In this passage, almost alone in all his Epistles, St. Paul, who does not seem to have been at all a close observer of external phenomena, uses metaphors drawn from natural life.

St. Paul, dealing with the essence of the question as it bore on the difficulties of his readers, says nothing here <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of those who will arise to judgment, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> of any intermediate condition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the former question, he scarcely ever alludes to it with any definiteness, but seems with deliberate choice to contemplate the final and absolute triumph of good (<a href="../../par/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-30.htm">Romans 11:30-36</a>). To the intermediate state he does not here allude. He is here only speaking of death and glorious resurrection. In <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1-4</a> he says all that he has to say on this latter question. It was not prominent in the minds of the early Christians, who, as Calvin says, were awaiting the return of Christ "from hour to hour."

The apostles and evangelists, not holding the slavish and superstitious fetish worship of the dead letter, often regard it as sufficient to give the general sense of the passages to which they refer. <span class="cmt_word">O grave, where is thy victory?</span> In the best attested reading (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), "death" is repeated, and in the best manuscripts this clause precedes the last. But if the reading, "O Hades," were correct, our translators, since they held it here impossible in accordance with their views to render it by "hell," ought to have taken warning, and seen the pernicious inapplicability of that rendering in other places where they have used it to express this same Greek word. Here "Hades" has probably been introduced into the Greek text from the LXX., which uses it for the <span class="accented">Sheol</span> of the original.

It must be admitted that this passing allusion to a distinct doctrine does not seem, at first sight, to harmonize with the glorious unity of the subject. No one can read it without a slight sense of <span class="accented">jar</span>, because it seems to introduce the element of dogmatic controversy. But this sense of incongruity is removed when we remember how intensely St. Paul felt that man is confronted with the horror of a broken Law, which at once reminds him of a Being infinitely holy, and of his own self condemnation (<a href="../../par/romans/7.htm">Romans 7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/3.htm">2 Corinthians 3</a>.). It is the sense that the Law in its deathful aspect is annulled, and the sinful soul delivered, which prompts the outburst of the next verse.

That your labour is not in vain. The thought of the verse is the same as that of <a href="../../par/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, "And let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not." Some general facts are very observable in this glorious chapter. 1. One is that St. Paul does not meet doubt by angry denunciation, or by crushing it with the iron mace of impatient authority. What would now be thought of Christians who denied the resurrection? Doubtless they were net mere speculative deniers of the resurrection, like Hymenaeus and Philetus (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-17.htm">2 Timothy 2:17</a>), but recent Gentile converts, who could not get over their pagan difficulties. Yet St. Paul meets them by personal appeals, by helpful analogies, by lofty reasoning, by the glowing force of inspiring convictions. Instead of taking refuge - <span class="accented">more</span> <span class="accented">ecclesiastico</span> - in anathema and excommunication, he meets error by the counter presentation of ennobling truth. 2. Another noteworthy fact is that St. Paul's hope of the resurrection rests, like all his theology, on the thought that the life of the Christian is a life "in Christ." 3. A third is his superiority to false analogies - like those of the butterfly and the phoenix - which sufficed many ancient reasoners. Even Christian writers like St. Clement of Rome continued to appeal to the phoenix as a proof of the resurrection. The greatest ancient thinkers - like Tacitus - believed in the existence of that fabulous bird, and even in the genuineness of a specimen of it which had been exhibited at Rome. Was there no "grace of superintendency" at work which prevented the sacred writers from adopting the universal error of their day? Had St. Paul appealed to the phoenix, centuries of Christian writers would have continued to maintain the existence of that creature; and science, laughing the belief to scorn, would (most unjustly) have made any allusion to it a proof of mental weakness, and of the falsity of the doctrine which it was supposed to prove. 4. A fourth point to be observed is the wisdom with which St. Paul holds himself aloof from speculative fancies, he does not, like Plato, appeal to the doctrine of "reminiscence" (<span class="accented">anamnesis</span>), or of unfulfilled ideas. He does not, like Kant, build any argument on man's failure to obey "the categorical imperative" of duty. He points to the sinless Man - to the fulfilled idea of Christ. His argument, which all could understand, is summed up in the words, "Ye are Christ's, and Christ is risen." Your resurrection from the death of sin to the life of righteousness is a pledge of your participation in Christ's resurrection from the grave. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_corinthians/14.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Corinthians 14"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 14" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_corinthians/16.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Corinthians 16"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Corinthians 16" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_corinthians/16.htm"><title>1 Corinthians 16 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_corinthians/16.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_corinthians/16.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_corinthians/15.htm" title="1 Corinthians 15">&#9668;</a> 1 Corinthians 16 <a href="../2_corinthians/1.htm" title="2 Corinthians 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - <span class="accented">Directions and arrangements.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning the collection for the saints.</span> "The saints" are here the poor Christians at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>). The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the "poor saints," being the poorest of the poor (<a href="../../par/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (<a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-30</a>), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a> <a href="../../par/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. <span class="cmt_word">As I have given order;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as I arranged.<span class="cmt_word"></span> To the Churches of Galatia.</span> Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (<a href="../../par/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>), or by letter.

It appears to have done so, for nothing is said of any visit of Timothy to Corinth, and St. Paul sent Titus. <span class="cmt_word">Without fear.</span> Timothy must at this time have been very young (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). As a mere substitute for St. Paul's personal visit, he would be unacceptable. In every allusion to him we find traces of a somewhat timid and sensitive disposition (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6-8</a>, etc.). He may well, therefore, have shrunk from the thought of meeting the haughty sophisters and disputatious partisans of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">As I also do.</span> "As a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel" (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). St. Paul felt for Timothy a deeper personal tenderness than for any of his other friends, and the companionship of this gentle and devoted youth was one of the chief comforts of his missionary labour.

There was a reason for adding this. The Corinthians would see that any unkindness or contempt shown towards Timothy would at once be reported to St. Paul. Who "the brethren" are is not mentioned, for in <a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> we are only told that Timothy was accompanied by Erastus. Perhaps St. Paul means with the brethren who conveyed this letter (see ver. 12), and who, as he supposed, would meet with Timothy at Corinth, or fall in with him on their return to meet St. Paul in Macedonia. One of these brethren must have been Titus (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7</a>), and there were two others.

This was all the more noble on his part because he seems to have been a special friend of Titus (<a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>).

It was necessary for him to assert his right to the apostolate in the highest sense of the word, as one who had received from Christ himself an authority equal to that of the twelve (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1-5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-5.htm">2 Corinthians 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-11.htm">2 Corinthians 12:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1-19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Of Jesus Christ.</span> In the Gospels the word "Christ" is all but invariably "<span class="accented">the</span> Christ," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Anointed, the Messiah. It is the designation of the office of Jesus as the promised Deliverer. We trace in the New Testament the gradual transition of the word from a title into a proper name. In the two names together our Lord is represented as "the Saviour," and the anointed Prophet, Priest, and King, first of the chosen people and then of all mankind. <span class="cmt_word">Through the will of God</span> (comp. 2 Corinthians 1 Ephesians Colossians <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-1.htm">2 Timothy 1:1</a>). This <span class="accented">special</span> call to the apostleship is emphatically expanded in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-1.htm">Galatians 1:1</a>. The vindication of the Divine and independent claim was essential to St. Paul's work. It was not due to any personal considerations, but to the necessity of proving that no human authority could be quoted to overthrow the gospel which was peculiarly "his gospel" (see <a href="../../par/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>), of which one main feature was the freedom of the Gentiles from the yoke of Judaic bondage. And Soathenes. The association of one or more brethren with himself in the greeting of his letters is peculiar to St. Paul. Silas and Timothy are associated with him in 1 and 2 Thessalonians; and Timothy, though so much his junior, in 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon; doubtless he would have been associated with St. Paul in this Epistle had he not been absent (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-17.htm">1 Corinthians 4:17</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>). The practice arose partly from St. Paul's exquisite courtesy and consideration towards his companions, partly from his shrinking from mere personal prominence. It is owing to the same reasons that in the earlier Epistles he constantly uses "we" for "I," and sometimes when he can only be speaking of himself (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>). But even in the Epistles to the Thessalonians he sometimes relapses from "we" into "I" (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>). Our brother; literally, the <span class="accented">brother</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of <span class="accented">"the</span> brethren" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>). Of Sosthenes nothing whatever is known. He may possibly be the amanuensis whom St. Paul employed for this letter. Later tradition, which in such matters is perfectly valueless, spoke of him as" one of the seventy disciples, and Bishop of Colophon" (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 1:12). There is a Jewish Sosthenes, a ruler of the synagogue, in <a href="../../par/acts/18-17.htm">Acts 18:17</a>; but it is only a vague conjecture that he may have been subsequently converted, and may have joined St. Paul at Ephesus. It is obvious that the persons named in the greetings of the Epistles were not in any way supposed to be responsible for their contents, lot St. Paul begins with "I" in ver. 4. <span class="accented">Brother.</span> At this time there was no recognized title for Christians. In the Acts they are vaguely spoken of as "those of this way." Among themselves they were known as "the saints," "the faithful," "the elect." The name "Christians" was originally a nickname devised by the Antiochenes. In the New Testament it only occurs as a designation used by enemies (<a href="../../par/acts/11-26.htm">Acts 11:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>).

In St. Paul's later Epistles, for some unknown reason, he prefers the address "to the saints." These forms of address show the absence of any fixed ecclesiastical government. He does not in this Epistle address any "bishops" or "presbyters" whom he might regard as responsible for the growing disorders which prevailed at Corinth, but he appeals to the whole Church. The word <span class="accented">ecclesia</span> - signifying those who were "called out of the world," and so primarily applied to "the congregation of Israel" - came ultimately to mean "a congregation." The only apostle who uses the word "synagogue" of the Christian assemblies is St. James (<a href="../../par/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Of God.</span> Not the Church of this or that party leader.

In 1 and 2 Thessalonians he prefers the form, "the Church of the <span class="accented">Thessalonians."</span> "The Church at Corinth" was an expression which involved the sharpest of contrasts. It brought into juxtaposition the holiest ideal of the new faith and the vilest degradations of the old paganism. It was "a glad and great paradox" (Bengel). The condition of society at Corinth, at once depraved and sophistical, throws light on many parts of the Epistle. Cicero describes the city as <span class="accented">"illus</span>trious a like for <span class="accented">wantonness</span>, opulence, and the study of philosophy." <span class="cmt_word">Even them that are sanctified.</span> The apostles could only write to Churches as being <span class="accented">really</span> Churches, and to Christians as being true Christians. In all general addresses they could only assume that the <span class="accented">actual</span> resembled the <span class="accented">ideal.</span> They never conceal the immense chasm which separated the real condition of many members of their Churches from the vocation which they professed. They <span class="accented">knew</span> also that it is (as Calvin says) "a perilous temptation to refuse the name of Church to every Church in which there is not perfect purity." Ideally even the Corinthian Christians were redeemed by Christ's expiation, consecrated and sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit. They could only be addressed in accordance with their ostensible position (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1; 5:68). Our Prayer book is constructed on the same principle. The harvest is still a harvest, though amongst the corn there may be many tares. <span class="cmt_word">In Christ Jesus</span>. The words, "in Christ," constitute what has been happily called "the monogram of St. Paul." The life of the true Christian is no longer his own. The Christ for him has become the Christ <span class="accented">in</span> him. His natural life is merged into a higher spiritual life. Baptized <span class="accented">into</span> Christ, he has become one with Christ. Called to be saints. (On this Christian calling, see <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>.) They are called to be united saints, not schismatic partisans or members of antagonistic cliques. The description of what they were <span class="accented">ideally</span> is the more emphatic because he feels how much they had fallen away. <span class="cmt_word">With all that...  in every place.</span> Perhaps this may mean the same as <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>, "With all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia;" or the words may imply that St. Paul's exhortations are applicable to all Christians, wherever they may be and (as is expressed in the next clause) whatever may be their varying shades of individual opinion. It was well in any case to remind the Corinthians that they formed but a fraction of the Christian communities. Catholicity, not provincialism, makes the true Church of God. <span class="cmt_word">Call upon the Name.</span> The Greek verb is here in the middle voice, not "who are called by the Name"(comp. <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-12.htm">Amos 9:12</a>, LXX.). It means, therefore, all who reverence the Name of Christ, all who adore their one "Lord" in the fulness of his nature (see <a href="../../par/joel/3-5.htm">Joel 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-21.htm">Acts 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/10.htm">Romans 10</a>:24; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>, etc.); in other words, "all who profess and call themselves Christians" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Their Lord and ours</span>. I connect these words, not with "place," as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">In omni loco ipsorum et nostro -</span> which, however it may be twisted, can give no good sense - but with "Jesus Christ." It has been in all ages a fatal temptation of party Christians to claim a monopoly of Christ for themselves and their own sects, as though <span class="accented">they</span> only taught the gospel, and were the <span class="accented">only</span> Christians or the <span class="accented">only</span> "Evangelicals." But Christ cannot thus be "parcelled into fragments" (see vers. 12, 13), nor has any party a right to boast exclusively, "I am of Christ." The addition, "and ours," could not be regarded as super fluous in writing to a Church of which one section wanted to assert an exclusive right in Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-3.htm">1 Corinthians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace.</span> This is St. Paul's greeting in all the Epistles except the pastoral Epistles, in which he beautifully adds the word "mercy." It is a remarkable blending of the Greek and Jewish salutations. The Greeks said <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and to them the word "grace" involved the notions of joy and brightness and prosperity. The calmer and more solemn greeting of the East was, "Peace be to thee." The Church unites both forms of greeting - "grace," the beginning of every blessing; "peace," the end of all blessings; and into both she infuses a deeper meaning, that of a "joy" which defied all tribulations, and a" peace which passeth all understanding." <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> God is the Source of "every good gift and every perfect gift." God is our Father as our Creator, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we become, in a higher sense, his children. Christ, in his mediatorial kingdom, is specially and immediately "our Lord," though that phrase, now so universal, only occurs (in its isolated form) in <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>. <span class="accented">Jesus Christ.</span> One of St. Paul's peculiarities of style is the constant reiteration of one dominant word. In the first nine verses of this Epistle, the Name "Jesus Christ" is repeated no less than nine times. "Observe," says St. Chrysostom, "how he <span class="accented">nails them down</span> to the Name of Christ, not mentioning any man, either apostle or teacher, but continually mentioning him for whom they yearn, as men preparing to awaken those who are drowsy after a debauch. For nowhere in any other Epistle is the Name of Christ so continually introduced By means of it he weaves together almost his whole exordium."

This very title involves an appeal to them to aim at unity among themselves; and St. Paul, like St. James (James 5:10), uses it to soften any austerity which might seem to exist in his language (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Through the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> that is, by the whole idea of Christ's being and office - the strongest bond of union between true Christians (see the powerful appeal in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1-6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye all speak the same thing;</span> that is, "that ye may all with one mind and one mouth glorify God" (<a href="../../par/romans/15-6.htm">Romans 15:6</a>).

The word is only used in this special sense in this Epistle. In <a href="../../par/matthew/9-16.htm">Matthew 9:16</a> and <a href="../../par/mark/2-21.htm">Mark 2:21</a> <span class="accented">schisma</span> means "a rent;" in John (<a href="../../par/john/7-43.htm">John 7:43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="../../par/john/10-19.htm">John 10:19</a>), "a division of opinion." There would be little or no harm in the <span class="accented">schismata</span> so far as they affected unessential points, if it was not their fatal tendency to end in "contentions" (<span class="accented">erides</span>) and "factions" (<span class="accented">haireseis</span>, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>). Corinth was a place where such divisions would be likely to spring up, partly from the disputatious vivacity and intellectual conceits of the inhabitants, partly from the multitudes of strangers who constantly visited the port, partly from the numerous diversities of previous training through which the various sections of converts had passed. <span class="cmt_word">Perfected together;</span> literally, <span class="accented">repaired, reunited.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In the same mind and in the same judgment</span>; that is, in what they think and believe (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>), and in what they assert and do (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>). The exhortation, "be of one mind," in every sense of the word, was as necessary in the ancient as in the modern Church (<a href="../../par/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-8.htm">1 Peter 3:8</a>).

The Greek only has "by them of Chloe. St. Paul wisely and kindly mentions his <span class="accented">authority</span> for these reports. Nothing is known of Chloe or her household. It has been conjectured that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, Corinthians who were now with St. Paul at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-16.htm">1 Corinthians 16:16</a>), may have been Chloe's slaves or freedmen. <span class="cmt_word">Contentions.</span> These are the works of the flesh (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>). The condition of the Church was the same when St. Clement of Rome wrote to them. He had still to complain of the "strange and alien and, for the elect of God, detest able and unholy spirit of faction which a few rash and self willed persons kindled to such a pitch of dementation" ('Ep. ad Corinthians 1.').

Their "contentions" are defined to be equivalent to "religious partisanships; "antagonistic adoption of the names and views of special teachers. Each <span class="cmt_word">one of you</span> saith. That party spirit ran so high that they were all listed on one side or another. None of them were wise enough and spiritual minded enough to hold aloof from parties altogether. They prided themselves on being "uncompromising" and "party men." <span class="accented">Saith</span>; in a self-assertive way (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I am of Paul.</span> He shows his indignation at their partisanship by first rebuking those who had used <span class="accented">his own name</span> as a party watchward. He disliked Paulinism as much as Petrinism (Bengel). All the Corinthians would probably have been in this sense Paulinists but for the visits of subsequent teachers. At present the Paul party consisted of those who adhered to his views about Gentile freedom, and who liked the simple spirituality of his teaching. St. Paul rose above the temptation of considering that party spirit is excusable in our own partisans. He reproves factiousness even in the party of freedom. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Apollos.</span> Apollos personally was absolutely loyal and honourable, but his visit to Corinth had done mischief. His impassioned oratory, his Alexandrian refinements, his allegorizing exegesis, the culture and polish of his style, had charmed the fickle Corinthians. The Apollonians were the party of culture. They had, as we see from later parts of the Epistle, exaggerated St. Paul's views, as expounded by Apollos, into extravagance. Puffed up with the conceit of knowledge, they had fallen into moral inconsistency. The egotism of oratorical rivals, the contemptuous tone to wards weaker brethren, the sophistical condonations of vice, were probably due to them. Apollos, as we see by his noble refusal to visit Corinth under present circumstances (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>), was as indignant as St. Paul himself at the perversion of his name into an engine of party warfare. (On Apollos, see <a href="../../par/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a> <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>.) Nothing further is known respecting him, but he is the almost undoubted author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which proves that he was of the school of St. Paul, while at the same time he showed a splendid originality in his way of arriving at the same conclusion as his teacher. <span class="cmt_word">I of Cephas</span>. The use of the Aramaic name (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-22.htm">1 Corinthians 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>), perhaps, shows that these Petrinists were Judaizers (though it should be added that St. Paul only uses the name "Peter" in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7, 8</a>). They personally disliked St. Paul, and questioned his apostolical authority. Perhaps the extravagances of the "speaking with tongues" arose in this party, who recalled the effects of the outpouring of the Spirit after Peter's great sermon on the day of Pentecost. <span class="cmt_word">And I of Christ.</span> We trace the origin of this party to one man in particular (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>), who was, or professed to be, an adherent of James, and therefore one of the more rigid Judaizers. He may have been one from the circle of Christ's earthly relatives - one of the Desposyni (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>), and, like St. James, may have had views resembling those of the Essenes and Ebionites. If so, he was probably the author of the questions about celibacy and marriage; and perhaps he prided himself on having seen "Christ in the flesh." This party at any rate, like some modern sects, was not ashamed to degrade into a party watchword even the sacred name of Christ, and to claim for a miserable clique an exclusive interest in the Lord of the whole Church. It is the privilege of every Christian to say, "Christianus sum;" but if he says it in a haughty, loveless, and exclusive spirit, he forfeits his own claim to the title. This exclusive Christ party is, perhaps, specially alluded to in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-7.htm">2 Corinthians 10:7-11</a>. The view of Chrysostom, which takes these words to be St. Paul's remark - "But I belong to Christ," is untenable, and would make trim guilty of the very self-assertiveness which he is reprobating.

"Is there a Pauline, a Petrine, an Apollonian, a Christian Christ?" Whether you call yourselves Liberals, or Intellectualists, or Catholics, or Bible Christians, your party spirit is a sin, and all the worse a sin because it pranks itself out in the guise of pure religious zeal. This is more forcible than to take the clause affirmatively:" Christ has been parcelled into fragments." In either ease we see" the tragic result of party spirit." <span class="cmt_word">Was Paul crucified for you?</span> Again he rebukes the partisanship which attached itself to his own name. This showed a splendid courage and honesty. The introduction of the question by the negative <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> expresses astonished indignation: "Can you possibly make a watchword of the name of a mere man, as though he had been crucified for you?" This outburst of feeling is very important, as proving the immeasurable distance which, in Paul's own view, separated him from his Lord. It is also instructive to see how St. Paul at once denounces the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of party without deigning to enter into the question as to <span class="accented">which</span> party of these wrangling "theologians" was most or least in the right.

Compare the practice of our Lord himself, in leaving his disciples to baptize (<a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>).

Gaius of Corinth (<a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>). It was one of the commonest of names.

The primary function of the apostles was "to bear witness" (<a href="../../par/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To preach the gospel.</span> St. Paul again "goes off" at this word, and dwells for eight verses on the character of his preaching. <span class="cmt_word">Not in wisdom of words;</span> not, that is, in a philosophic and oratorical style.

It shows the heroic character of the faith of St. Paul that he deliberately preached the doctrine of the cross because he felt that therein lay the conversion and salvation of the world, although he was well aware that he could preach no truth so certain at first to revolt the unregenerate hearts of his hearers. To the Jews "the cross" was the tree of shame and horror; and a crucified person was "accursed of God" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). To the Greeks the cross was the gibbet of a slave's infamy and a murderer's punishment. There was not a single association connected with it except those of shame and agony. The thought of "a crucified Messiah" seemed to the Jews a revolting folly; the worship of a crucified malefactor seemed to the Greeks "an execrable superstition" (Tacitus, 'Ann.,' 15:44; Pliny, 'Epp.' 10:97); yet so little did St. Paul seek for popularity or immediate success, that this was the very doctrine which he put in the forefront, even at a city so refined and so voluptuous as Corinth. And the result proved his inspired wisdom. That very cross became the recognized badge of Christianity, and when three centuries had elapsed it was woven in gold upon the banners and set in jewels on the diadems of the Roman empire. For had not Christ prophesied, And I, <span class="accented">if I be lifted up</span>, will draw all men unto me"? <span class="cmt_word">Unto us which are being saved;</span> who are on the way of salvation. The same present participle is used in <a href="../../par/luke/13-23.htm">Luke 13:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>. It is the power of God. Because the cross is at the heart of that gospel which is "the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth" (<a href="../../par/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>), though many were tempted to be ashamed of it. It could never be a carnal weapon of warfare, and yet was mighty for every purpose (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4, 5</a>).

If St. Paul has <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-18.htm">Isaiah 33:18</a> in his mind, the word "disputer" corresponds to "the counter of the towers" (comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12</a>).

The notion of a suffering and humiliated Messiah, who reduced them to the level of all God's other children, was to them "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14</a>).

The accent of profound contempt is discernible in all the early allusions of Greeks and Romans to Christianity. The only epithets which they could find for it were "execrable," "malefic," "depraved," "damnable" (Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, etc.). The milder term is "excessive superstition." The heroic constancy of martyrs appeared even to M. Aurelius only under the aspect of a "bare obstinacy." The word used to express the scorn of the Athenian philosophers for St. Paul's "strange doctrine" is one of the coarsest disdain (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and they called him "a seed pecker" (<a href="../../par/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18, 32</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a mere picker up of "learning's crumbs."

St. Paul is the best commentator on himself.

And the world, once so scornful, has learnt that Christ is indeed the <span class="accented">Power</span> of God. When Rudolph of Hapsburgh was being crowned, and in the hurry no sceptre could be found, he seized a crucifix, and swore that that should be his only sceptre. When St. Thomas of Aquinum asked St. Bonaventura what was the source of his immense learning, he pointed in silence to his crucifix.

The lesson was specially needful to the Corinthians, whom Cicero describes ('De Leg. Age,' 2:32) as "famous, not only for their luxuriousness, but also for their wealth and philosophic culture."

The only illustrious converts mentioned in the New Testament are Joseph of Arimathaea, Nicodemus, Sergius Paulus, and Dionysius the Areopagitc. <span class="cmt_word">Not many noble.</span> All this was a frequent taunt against Christians, but they made it their boast. Christianity came to redeem and elevate, not the few, but the many, and the many must ever be the weak and the humble. Hence Christ called fishermen as his apostles, and was known as "the Friend of publicans and sinners." None of the rulers believed on him (<a href="../../par/john/7-48.htm">John 7:48</a>). It must, however, be borne in mind that these words apply mainly and primarily to the first age of Christianity. It was essential that its victory should be due to Divine weapons only, and that it should shake the world "by the irresistible might of weakness." After a time, the wisest and the noblest and the most powerful were called. Kings became the nursing fathers of the gospel, and queens its nursing mothers. Yet the ideal truth remains, and human power shows utter weakness, and human wisdom is capable of sinking into the depths of folly.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as it is written.</span> The whole sentence in the Greek is unfinished. The thought seems to be, "But God has revealed to us things which eye hath not seen, etc., though the princes of this world were ignorant of them." Scriptural quotations are often thus introduced, apart from the general grammar of the sentence, as in the Greek of <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">1 Corinthians 1:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Eye hath not seen,</span> etc. The Revised Version is here more literal and accurate. The quotation as it stands is not found in the Old Testament. It most resembles <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>, but also vaguely resembles Isaiah 53:15; 65:17. It may be another instance of a loose general reminiscence (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-21.htm">1 Corinthians 14:21</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/9-33.htm">Romans 9:33</a>). "Non verbum e verbo expressit," says St. Jerome, "sed <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;</span> aliis sermonibus indicavit." St. Chrysostom regards the words as part of a lost prophecy. Origen, Zacharias of Chrysopolis, and others say that the words occurred in an apocryphal book, the 'Apocalypse of Elias,' but if so the apocryphal writer must have had the passage of Isaiah in his mind. Some regard the words as a fragment of some ancient liturgy. Origen thought that they came from the 'Revelation of Elijah.' They were also to be found in the 'Ascension of Isaiah' (Jerome on <a href="../../par/isaiah/64-4.htm">Isaiah 64:4</a>). and they occur in the Talmud (Sanhedr. 99 a). In a curious fragment of Hegesippus (circ.  <span class="date">A.D. 150</span>) preserved in Photius (Cod. 232.), that old writer indignantly repudiates this passage, saying that it is futile and "utterly belies (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the Holy Scriptures and the Lord, who says, 'Blessed are your eyes which see, and your ears which hear.'" Photius cannot understand why (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>) Hegesippus should speak thus. Routh ('Rel. Sacr.,' 253) hardly knows how to excuse him; but perhaps if we had the context of the fragment we should see that he is attacking, not the words themselves, but some perversion of them by heretics, like the Docetae. The phrase, "As it is written," decisively marks an intention to refer to Scripture. Neither have entered into the heart of man; literally, <span class="accented">things which have not set foot upon the heart.</span> The general thought is that God's revelations (for the immediate reference is to <span class="accented">these</span>, and <span class="accented">not</span> to future bliss) pass all understanding. The quotation of these words as referring to heaven is one of the numberless instances of texts inaccurately applied.

"Explaining spiritual things in spiritual words." This meaning the Greek will not bear, but Calvin and Beza get the same meaning by rendering it, "Adapting spiritual things to spiritual words." It is doubtful whether the Greek verb (<span class="accented">sunkrinontes</span>) can be rendered "comparing," which comes from the Vulgate, <span class="accented">comparantes.</span> Wickliffe has the version, "Maken a liknesse of spyritual things to goostli men, for a besteli man persuyved not through thingis." The commonest sense of the word in the LXX. is "interpreting" (<a href="../../par/genesis/40-8.htm">Genesis 40:8</a>, etc.), and the best rendering is, "Explaining spirituals to spiritual men." If it be supposed that the verb <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> acquired the sense of "comparing" in Hellenistic Greek (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-12.htm">2 Corinthians 10:12</a>; Wisd. 7:29 Wisd. 15:18), then the rendering of our Authorized Version may stand.

This elementary truth is again and again insisted on in Scripture, and ignored by sceptics (<a href="../../par/romans/8-6.htm">Romans 8:6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/john/14-17.htm">John 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-3.htm">2 Corinthians 4:3-6</a>). This verse is sometimes used to depreciate knowledge, reason, and intellect. On that abuse of the passage, see Hooker, 'Eccl.

It is, perhaps, sufficient to say that if God has no need of human knowledge, he has still less need of human ignorance.

The Spirit which you received at baptism ought to have lifted you above these mean rivalries. You ought to be something more than mere men.

In other words, "wise" is here equivalent to "skilful." Since Paul had received the grace of God for this very purpose, he was made "wise" by the knowledge of Christ (for the metaphor of building, see <a href="../../par/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-5.htm">1 Peter 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The foundation</span>; rather, a <span class="accented">foundation.</span> Though in truth there is but one foundation, as he proceeds to say, St. Paul always refused to build on the foundation laid by another (<a href="../../par/romans/15-20.htm">Romans 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Another</span>.

This is again and again inculcated in Scripture: <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-16.htm">Isaiah 28:16</a>, "Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation." On this rock the Church is built (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>: <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).

So in the Midrash Tehillin, the words of false teachers are compared to hay.

This tense is constantly used to express the continuity and the present working of Divine laws (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>). As the nominative is not expressed, it is uncertain whether "it" refers to "each man's work" or to" the day." Either gives an apposite sense (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:8</a>). Some would make "he" (namely, Christ) the nominative, because "the day" means "the day of Christ;" and in favour of this view they quote <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>, "The revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven in flaming fire." But the ellipse of an unexpressed nominative is harsh. <span class="cmt_word">The fire itself shall prove each man's work.</span> This is the "probatory" or testing fire of the day of the Lord, of which we read very frequently in the Fathers. The doctrine of purgatory has been in some measure founded on this verse (Council of Florence, A.D. 1439); but such a view of it cannot be maintained. The reader will find the subject examined and the quotations from the Fathers given in the writer's 'Mercy and Judgment,' p. 69. All that is said here is that the fire of Christ's presence - the consuming fire of God's love - shall <span class="accented">test</span> the work, not <span class="accented">purge</span> it. The fire is <span class="accented">probatory</span>, not <span class="accented">purgatorial</span>, and it is not in itself a fife of wrath, for it tests the gold and silver as well as the inferior elements of the structure. It is the fire of the refiner, not of the avenger.

It is an inexpressible source of comfort to us, amid the weakness and ignorance of our lives, to know that if we have only erred through human frailty and feebleness, while yet we desired to be sincere and faithful, the work will be burnt, yet the workman will be saved. Some of the Fathers gave to this beautiful verse the shockingly perverted meaning that "the workman would be <span class="accented">preserved alive</span> for endless torments," "salted with fire" in order to endure interminable agonies. The meaning is impossible, for it reverses the sense of the word "saved;" and makes it equivalent to "damned;" but the interpretation is an awful proof of the distortions to which a merciless human rigorism and a hard, self styled orthodoxy have sometimes subjected the Word of God. <span class="cmt_word">Yet so as by fire;</span> rather, <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by means of fire</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>).

Similarly it is said in <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a> that Noah was saved "through water" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). The ship is lost, the sailor saved; the workman is saved, the work is burned.

In later patristic usage the word means "sacraments;" but St. Paul has expressly said (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>) that his mission was to preach the gospel, not primarily to administer the sacraments. (For descriptions of the work of a minister according to St. Paul's lofty ideal, see the pastoral Epistles, and <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7-11</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-25.htm">Colossians 1:25-29</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-21, 24-28</a>.

A minister is not to be estimated as a supernatural teacher, or a civil autocrat, or an infallible critic, but as an ambassador from Christ, who reveals to the "initiated" that which they could not otherwise know.

So our Lord has described the "faithful and wise steward" in <a href="../../par/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42, 43</a>.

The Corinthians might have expected that the conclusion of St. Paul's remarks would be a recognition of their right to sit in judgment on his faithfulness; but it is, on the contrary, an expression of his complete indifference to their shallow and unfair estimate, and an appeal to the approval of his own conscience and to the judgment of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">It is a very small thing;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is for the least. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That I should be judged of you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">that I should be examined by you</span> (<span class="accented">anakritho</span>). Technically the word <span class="accented">anakrisis</span> means "an examination preliminary to trial." <span class="cmt_word">Or of man's judgment</span>; literally, <span class="accented">of man's day.</span> The brief day of human life is bounded by too narrow an horizon for accurate judgments. Many of the greatest and best men have felt, like Lord Bacon, that they must leave to other generations the right estimate of their characters, views, and actions. St. Jerome reckons the expression "day" for "judgment" among the "Cilicisms" of St. Paul (Jeremiah, 'Ad Algas.,' 10), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the expressions due to his early training in Cilicia. More probably (as Grotius thinks) there is a reference to the "day" fixed for earthly trials (<span class="accented">diem dicere</span>, equivalent to "to impeach"), and to the phrase "the day of judgment" - "the woeful day" of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-16.htm">Jeremiah 17:16</a>. The word "day" in all languages and idioms signifies "judgment" (Hammond). From <span class="accented">dies</span>, a day, comes the phrase "a diet." A "daysman" means an arbitrator. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, I judge not mine own self.</span> Here, as in the previous clause and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>, the verb is not <span class="accented">krino</span>, I judge, but <span class="accented">anakrino</span>, I examine. Thus the verse discourages all morbid self introspection. It also shows that St. Paul is not arrogantly proclaiming himself superior to the opinion of the Corinthians, but is pointing out the necessary inadequacy of all human judgments. The heart is too liable to self deceit (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9, 10</a>) to enable it to pronounce a judgment with unerring accuracy. Hence neither a man's contemporaries nor the man himself can form any final estimate of him or of his fitting position, because their knowledge is too imperfect. History often reverses the decision of contemporaries. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a></div><div class="verse">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know nothing by myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">nothing against myself.</span> The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. "I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen," says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin <span class="accented">Nil conscire sibi.</span> The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/job/27-6.htm">Job 27:6</a>. St. Paul says, "The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. "Who can understand his errors?" asks the psalmist (<a href="../../par/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>); and the "secret faults" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself" the chief of sinners" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. <span class="cmt_word">Yet am I not hereby justified.</span> Because "every way of a man" is apt to be "right in his own eyes," but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight "no man living is justified." St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that judgeth me is the Lord.</span> This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (<a href="../../par/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, "look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within." For God, being "greater than our hearts" (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>), may count "the long 'yes' of life" against the one "no," or the single faithless minute.

But St. Paul says "praise" for two reasons - partly because he is thinking of faithful teachers like Cephas, Apollos, and himself, who were depreciated by rival factions; and partly because he, like other apostles, shows an invariable tendency to allude to the bright rather than to the dark side of judgment. The "praise from God" - the "Well done, good and faithful servant" - is so infinitely precious that it reduces to insignificance the comparative value of human praise or blame. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a></div><div class="verse">And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Contrast between the inflated self sufficiency of the Corinthians and the earthly humiliation of the apostles.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brethren</span>. The occasional use of this and similar expressions ("beloved," etc.) often serves to strengthen an appeal, or, as here, to soften the sternness of a rebuke. <span class="cmt_word">I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos.</span> The meaning seems to be that St. Paul has prominently transferred to himself and to Apollos, or rather to the parties who chose their names as watchwords, the proof as to the sin and futility of partisanship which applied equally well to the parties which ranged themselves under other names. (For the verb "transfer" - more often "transform" see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-13.htm">2 Corinthians 11:13, 14, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-21.htm">Philippians 3:21</a>.)

The word "to think" is omitted in the best manuscripts. The phrase, "which have been written," is of very uncertain meaning. It may refer generally to "the scriptural rule" that all boasting is wrong (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23</a>), or to the humble estimate of teachers which he has just been writing down for them. All his Old Testament quotations so far (ch. 1:19, 31; 3:19) have referred to humility. Some see in it a reference to <a href="../../par/matthew/23-8.htm">Matthew 23:8</a> "Be not ye called Babbi;" but it is uncertain whether St. Matthew's Gospel was yet written; and St. Paul never refers so directly to any written Gospel. Perhaps it is a sort of proverb," Keep always to strict evidence;" "Say nothing which cannot be proved in black and white." The text, like so many others, has only a very remote connection with the sense in which it is usually quoted. <span class="cmt_word">That no one of you he puffed up.</span> St. Paul was painfully impressed by this <span class="accented">inflation</span> of the Corinthians, and he often recurs to this word as a description of their vain conceit (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-18.htm">1 Corinthians 4:18, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-20.htm">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>). In other Epistles the word is only found once (in <a href="../../par/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For one against another.</span> The expression is a profound one. The glorying in men (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-21.htm">1 Corinthians 3:21</a>), undesirable in any circumstances, becomes the more pernicious because the exaltation of one set of teachers is almost invariably accompanied by mean and unjust depreciation of any who could be supposed to be their rivals.

The loving delicate irony is, in a different way, as effective as the stern denunciation of St. John: "Thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked" (<a href="../../par/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>). St. Paul's satire is always akin to charity; it is never satire with no pity in it. <span class="cmt_word">Ye have reigned as kings</span>. The word simply means "ye reigned." Like the Stoics, so each little Corinthian sectarian regarded himself as a king.

The Corinthians were cultivated enough to appreciate the deep irony of the phrase, "We poor apostles have become quite needless to you in your lordly independence." <span class="cmt_word">And I would to God ye did reign</span>. The words "to God" should be omitted. The loving heart of St. Paul could never long keep up a strain of irony.

The news had come to him "from those of Chloe's household." But St. Paul was not acting on mere "report." The Greek phrase <span class="accented">implies</span>, "It is notorious that there is uncleanness among you." St. Paul must have felt it to be a bad feature in the character of the Corinthian Church that they had not mentioned this gross scandal in their letter. <span class="cmt_word">Commonly</span>; rather, <span class="accented">actually</span> or <span class="accented">absolutely</span>; Elsewhere in the New Testament the worn only occurs in <a href="../../par/matthew/5-24.htm">Matthew 5:24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-7.htm">1 Corinthians 6:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-29.htm">1 Corinthians 15:29</a>.

The word involves an indignant climax, "Yes, and uncleanness of such a kind that," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Is not so much as named.</span> The true reading is, <span class="accented">does not even exist.</span> This form of incest was, indeed, "named" among the Gentiles, for it forms the basis of the story of Hippolytus, the scene of which was in the neighbourhood of Corinth; but the feelings even of pagans were so shocked by it that Cicero alludes to such a crime in the words, "Oh, incredible wickedness, and except in this woman's case - unheard of in all experience!" ('Pro Cluent.,' 5). At this very epoch Nero deepened the general execration against himself by the generally accepted suspicion that he had been guilty of a yet more flagrant crime. <span class="cmt_word">Should have;</span> rather, that <span class="accented">a certain person has his father's wife.</span> Apparently this was some nominal Christian, who was living in open sin with his stepmother, and thereby braving the curse of <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-20.htm">Deuteronomy 27:20</a>. We gather from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-12.htm">2 Corinthians 7:12</a> that the father was living, and had also joined the Christian community. From the complete silence as to the crime of the woman, it must be inferred that she was a heathen. Whether she had been divorced or not does not appear, nor whether the offender was nominally married to her or not. <span class="cmt_word">His father's wife.</span> He might have used the one Greek word for stepmother (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>), but the periphrasis might remind some of the heinousness of the sin, and of <a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And ye are puffed up;</span> perhaps rather, <span class="accented">And have</span> ye <span class="accented">been puffed up?</span> The "ye," being expressed m the Greek, is emphatic - "ye, the very persons whose horror ought to have been most intense." It might seem inconceivable that any community calling itself Christian would fall so low as to be puffed up at the existence of such an offence among them. There is, indeed, a subtle and close connection between arrogance and sensuality, and beth are sometimes fatally linked to the conceit of religious knowledge without the reality. But not even a heathen community could have been "puffed up" on such grounds. Yet the Corinthians may have been "puffed up" with the conceited reasons which induced them to leave the offence unrebuked, because they boasted the possession of some spurious "knowledge." Perhaps they bad seized some deadly notion of antinomian liberty, such as has existed at times among Gnostic sects, like the Ophites in ancient and the Anabaptists in modern days. Perhaps they sheltered themselves under the arrogant Jewish rule that all a man's conditions of life were altered by becoming a proselyte - that old relationships were for him entirely abolished; for the Jews held that a prosolyte was like "a newborn child," and had begun life a second time (Bechoroth, f. 47, 1), and might marry any of his relatives. Such miserable sophisms would acquire fresh force from the universal impurity with which Corinthian society was stained, and which rendered it necessary for St. Paul in these Epistles to utter his most solemn warnings against every kind of sensuality (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15-18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:83, 34; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-11.htm">2 Corinthians 5:11</a>, etc.). But besides all this, St. Paul's remark does not necessarily mean that their "inflation" was exclusively connected with Gnostic excesses, which bore on the case of this offender. It may mean, "Here is a gross fault in the midst of you, and yet - not <span class="accented">propter</span> <span class="accented">hoc</span>, but <span class="accented">cum hoc</span> - the characteristic of your religious factions is pride and conceit." This was indeed <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to play the Corinthian," in the worst sense, of that proverbial taunt. Possibly the prominence or wealth of the offender may have led to a more easy condonation of his crime. Exculpatory sophism may have been suggested by self interest. <span class="cmt_word">That</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in order that, as a result of your godly sorrow, the offender might be removed from your midst. <span class="cmt_word">He that hath done this deed.</span> The language of St. Paul, as always, is as delicate as clearness would allow. The fact that the verb is in the past aorist may perhaps allow us to <span class="accented">hope</span> that the offence, at any rate in its most aggravated forms, had ceased to be committed. The manner of the crime ("in such a way") seems to have been an aggravation of the crime itself. In this indignant verse we have, as Stanley says, "the burst of the storm, the mutterings of which had been heard in the earlier chapters." So intense was the effect produced by St. Paul's stern severity, that a great part of the Second Epistle had to be devoted to allaying the agitation which these words had excited (see especially <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8-12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I verily</span>. The broken structure of the verse shows the deep emotion with which it was penned - as it were with sobs.

The "so" means "with all these circumstances of aggravation." The same verb is used in <a href="../../par/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>. The broken periods of the Greek reflect the emotion of the writer. The passage is as it were written with sobs (Wordsworth).

That he could claim "the power of the Lord" resulted from his possession of the Holy Spirit. and the special commission to bind and to loose, to remit and to retain, on earth, which Christ had entrusted to the apostles (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To deliver such a one unto Satan.</span> Scripture nowhere defines the character and limits of such a sentence as this. By cutting off an offender from Church communion (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14, 15</a>), that is, from all the visible means of grace, he was for the time separated from spiritual influences, and was, therefore, so far handed over to Satan. The phrase is also applied to Hymenaeus and Alexander, in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>. It is very doubtful whether it was necessarily meant to involve such physical inflictions as fell on Ananias, Sapphira, or Elymas. It is, however, important to observe that the intention of the sentence, like the true intention of excommunication, when exercised in a right spirit (see Hooker, 'Eccl. Pol.,' 3:1, &sect; 13), was not wrathful, but merciful. It was, as Calvin says, "medicinale remedium" - "not for destruction, but for edification" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>). Hymenaeus and Alexander were handed to Satan, not for their final ruin and damnation, but with a kind and remedial purpose, "that they may learn not to blaspheme" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a>), and this offender with the express object ', that his spirit may be saved." Had these facts been more deeply studied, there would have been a very different tone and spirit in many of the mediaeval anathemas. <span class="accented">Such a one</span> (setup. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-7.htm">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>). He seems to hold aloof from the man's very name. So "such as she" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) is used of the adulteress in <a href="../../par/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">For the destruction of the flesh;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that all <span class="accented">carnal influences</span> in him might be destroyed. It is not his "body" which is to be destroyed, but the , "flesh," the <span class="accented">jetzer hara</span>, or "evil impulse," as the Jews called it. When this was destroyed, the body might once more become a temple of the Holy Ghost. <span class="cmt_word">That the spirit may be saved.</span> The destruction of the lowest element of our human nature is the salvation of the highest; it is the cutting away of the dead corpse from the living soul. <span class="cmt_word">In the day of the Lord;</span> when the Lord should judge the quick and the dead. The merciful intention of St. Paul is clearly developed in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-6.htm">2 Corinthians 2:6-11</a>. He looked on God's judgments as <span class="accented">remedial</span>, not as solely retributive (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29-32</a>). Here, as Chrysostom finely says, the apostle lays down, as it were, his laws to the devil, telling him how far, and how far <span class="accented">only</span>, he can proceed. The object of excommunication is to save the offender, and not to do the devil's work by ensuring his eternal ruin. We can imagine how awful would be the solemnity of these words when they were first read aloud to the little Christian communities of Corinth. It was natural that they should produce an overwhelming excitement.

For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Purge out therefore.</span> The word "therefore" is absent from the best manuscripts, and the abruptness is more emphatic without it. No doubt the metaphor was suggested by the fact that St. Paul was writing about the time of the Passover (<a href="../../par/acts/16-8.htm">Acts 16:8</a>). The most essential requisite of the Jewish regulations, with which his whole training had made him so familiar, was the absolute putting away, and even destruction, of every trace of leaven, which was diligently sought for the day before the Passover began. The putting away of leaven was a type of sanctification. <span class="cmt_word">The old leaven</span>. "Old" as belonging to their unregenerate and unconverted condition; a remnant of the day when they had been Gentiles and Jews who had not known Christ. The least <span class="accented">willing</span> tolerance of the taint would cause it to work throughout the whole society. <span class="cmt_word">As ye are unleavened.</span> Leaven is the type of evil in its secret and corrupting workings. Ideally, Christians can only be addressed as "unleavened," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as "purged from their own old sins" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-9.htm">2 Peter 1:9</a>); and it is the method of Scripture (indeed, it is the only possible method) to address Christians as being Christians <span class="accented">indeed</span>, and therefore in their <span class="accented">ideal</span> rather than their actual character. Some have taken these words to mean, "You are actually keeping the Passover, and therefore have no leaven among you;" but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the words cannot bear this meaning; nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> was St. Paul likely to appeal so prominently to a Jewish ordinance; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he is thinking of the Christian Easter, and only borrowing a casual illustration from the Jewish Passover. <span class="cmt_word">For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us;</span> rather, in the true reading, for our <span class="accented">passover also was sacrificed - even Christ.</span> As Christians, the Gentile Corinthians certainly did not keep the Jewish Passover; but St. Paul reminds them that they too had a Passover - that for them, too a Paschal Victim had been offered, whose sacrificial blood had been shed for their redemption (<a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore let us keep the feast.</span> Let us keep the Christian feast of Christ's resurrection in that spirit of holiness - of purging away sin from the midst of us - which was symbolized by the Jewish removal of leaven. <span class="cmt_word">Not with old leaven</span>. For now ye are "in Christ," and, therefore, are a "new creation." Leaven is the type of hypocrisy (<a href="../../par/luke/12-1.htm">Luke 12:1</a>) in its secret workings, but more generally it is a type of every corrupting influence. <span class="cmt_word">Of sincerity and truth.</span> "All that corresponds to an unsullied, uncontaminated, and genuine Christian character." The beautiful Greek word for "sincerity" means freedom from all admixture. It is, perhaps, derived from "testing in the sunshine," and is used by St. Paul in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>. "Truth" means "reality."

The attempt to get rid of so plain a statement, in the supposed interests of some superstitious notion that every line which an apostle wrote to a Church must necessarily have been inspired and infallible, is at once unscriptural and grossly superstitious. The notion that "the Epistle" intended is <span class="accented">this</span> Epistle is an absurdity invented in the interests of the same fiction. The only hypothesis which could give the least plausibility to such a view is that which makes this paragraph a postscript or marginal addition after the letter was finished; but there is little or nothing in favour of such a view. <span class="cmt_word">Not to company with.</span> The Greek word is rather stronger: <span class="accented">not to be mingled up among</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-14.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:14</a>).

The principle of selfishness may work equally in greed and in lust. <span class="cmt_word">Extortioners</span>. The word may also mean "ravishers," but there is no reason to abandon the sense of "rapacious." <span class="cmt_word">Idolaters</span>. This is the earliest instance of the use of this word, which does not occur in the LXX. No Christian could still be an open "idolater." So, unless we suppose that the expression has slipped in involuntarily, we must here give the word a metaphorical sense, as in <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>. We must else be driven to suppose that there were some half and half Christians, like Constantine, who "feared the Lord, and served their own gods" (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-9.htm">1 Corinthians 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-10.htm">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-5.htm">Ephesians 5:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For then must ye needs go out of the world;</span> <span class="accented">for in that case</span> (as they had perhaps implied in their letter of questions to St. Paul) <span class="accented">ye would have been morally bound to leave the world altogether</span> and seek a new one. The Greek particle <span class="accented">ara</span> perhaps refers to the astonishment caused by their misapprehension of St. Paul's rule. The clause throws painful light on the condition of the heathen world. If all communication with "fornicators" was to be forbidden, the sin was so universal, especially at Corinth, that all intercourse with Gentiles would have be. come impossible. Even some who professed to be stern moralists among the heathen, like Cato and Cicero, looked on the sin as being, at the worst, quite venial, and even, under certain circumstances, commendable. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-11.htm">1 Corinthians 5:11</a></div><div class="verse">But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But now I have written unto you.</span> The tense used is, perhaps, the epistolary aorist, and is therefore equivalent to "but now I write to you;" otherwise the sense is, "but what I <span class="accented">meant</span> in my letter was," etc. The position of the words rather favours this view. St. Paul expressly tells them in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-27.htm">1 Corinthians 10:27</a> that he never intended to forbid all intercourse with heathens. They were not to be "taken out of the world," but to be free from evil (<a href="../../par/john/17-15.htm">John 17:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any man that is called a brother.</span> The word "brother" was used before the name "Christian" was accepted by the members of the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Or an idolater</span> (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-7.htm">1 Corinthians 10:7, 14</a>).

If the phrase be pressed, it would involve exclusion from all privileges of the body, for the Holy Communion was celebrated in connection with the <span class="accented">agapae.</span> But the general meaning is that of <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>, "We command you... that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly."

The phrase "them that are without" was originally a Jewish phrase. To the Jews all men were outsiders (<span class="accented">chitsonin</span>) except themselves. The phrase was adopted by Christians, but in a less contemptuous sense (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>).

When one of the litigants was a heathen, Christians were allowed to go before heathen law courts, because no other remedy was possible. <span class="cmt_word">Go to law before the unjust.</span> The "unjust" is here used for "Gentiles," because it at once suggests a reason against the dereliction of Christian duty involved in such a step. How "unjust" the pagans were in the special sense of the word, the Christians of that day had daily opportunities of seeing; and in a more general sense, the Gentiles were "sinners" (<a href="../../par/matthew/26-45.htm">Matthew 26:45</a>). Even the Jews were bound to settle their civil disputes before their own tribunals. The ideal Jew was <span class="accented">jashar</span>, or "the upright man," and Jews could not consistently seek integrity from those who were not upright. <span class="accented">A fortiori</span>, Christians ought not to do so. <span class="cmt_word">Before the saints.</span> All Christians were ideally "saints," just as the heathen were normally "unjust." If Christians went to law with one another before the heathen, they belied their profession of mutual love, caused scandal, and were almost necessarily tempted into compliance with heathen customs, even to the extent of recognizing idols. Our Lord had already laid down the rule that "brothers" ought to settle their quarrels among themselves (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2</a></div><div class="verse">Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Do ye not know?</span> The word "or" should be supplied from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, C, D, F, etc. Bishop Wordsworth points out that this emphatic question occurs ten times in these two Epistles (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3, 9, 15, 16, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13, 24</a>), and only twice in all the rest (<a href="../../par/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>). It was a fitting rebuke to those who took for knowledge their obvious ignorance.

So Daniel (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-22.htm">Daniel 7:22</a>) had said, "The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High." Our Lord had confirmed this promise to his apostles, "Ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel" (<a href="../../par/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). Various modes of evading the literal sense have been adopted, but even in the Book of Wisdom we find, "They [the righteous] shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people" (Wisd. 3:8). All speculation as to the manner and extent in which the saints shall share in the work of Christ as Judge of the quick and dead, are obviously futile. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be judged;</span> literally, <span class="accented">is being judged -</span> the present points to the future, as though that which is inevitable is already in course of fulfilment. <span class="cmt_word">To judge the smallest matters;</span> literally, <span class="accented">of the smallest judgments.</span>

The statement furnishes no data for further speculation. It can hardly mean "evil spirits," for where the word is entirely unqualified it always means good angels; otherwise we might refer it to the "angels which kept not their first estate" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). It is impossible, and not straightforward, to explain away the word "angels" as meaning Church officials, etc., or to make the word "judge" mean "involve a condemnation of them by comparison with ourselves." All that we can say is that "God chargeth even his angels with folly, and in his sight the very heavens are not clean" (<a href="../../par/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>); and that "to angels hath he not subjected the world to come" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>). We must take the plain meaning of the apostle's words, whether we can throw any light on his conceptions or not. The only alternative is to suppose that the word means "those who <span class="accented">once</span> were good angels," but <span class="accented">are now</span> fallen spirits. It was so understood by Tertullian, Chrysostom, etc. <span class="cmt_word">How much more;</span> rather, to <span class="accented">say nothing of.</span> The accurate rendering of these verses is a matter of some difficulty, but not to an extent which affects the material sense, or which can be explained without a minute knowledge of Greek.

What he is here reprobating is their objectionable method of settling them. <span class="cmt_word">Set them to judge who are least esteemed in the Church.</span> This implies an utter scorn of trivial quarrels about personal rights. Surely the lowliest, the most unregarded members of the Church - those of no account - have wisdom enough to decide in such small matters. Thus when there arose a murmuring between Hebrews and Hellenists about the daily distribution to widows, the apostles, thinking that they had much more important work in hand than the adjustment of such jealousies, left the whole matter in the hands of the seven deacons. Some understand "those held of no account in the Church" to mean heathens; but he is here forbidding them to bring their quarrels before the heathens. Of course, ideally, none ought to be "despised" or "held of no account" in the Church; but St. Paul is here speaking relatively, and with reference to the views of the Corinthians themselves, and not without irony. The perfect participle, "those who have been set at nought," perhaps means persons of proved inferiority of judgment.

Perhaps the Corinthians thought that they would be saved by the mere fact of having been admitted into God's kingdom (the Christian Church in all its highest privileges) by baptism. St. Paul here lays down, as distinctly as St. James does, that faith without works is dead, and privileges without holiness are abrogated. The spirit of his warning is the same as that of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord...  are these;" or that of St. John the Baptist, "Say not unto yourselves, We be Abraham's sons." Christians have often been liable to the temptation of underrating the peril which results from the falling asunder of action from knowledge. There can be no greater danger than that of talking slightingly of "mere morality." Religion is not an outward service, but a spiritual life manifested by a holy living. <span class="cmt_word">Be not deceived.</span> So our Lord says," Let no man deceive you" (<a href="../../par/mark/13-5.htm">Mark 13:5</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>).

The self deception of merely verbal orthodoxy is the most dangerous of all. <span class="cmt_word">Neither fornicators</span>. The first four classes of sinners were specially prevalent at Corinth, where, indeed, impurity formed part of the recognized cult of the local Aphrodite (comp. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). Lists of these "works of the flesh," which were the all but universal curse and stain of heathendom, occur also in <a href="../../par/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-7</a>.

By "all things," of course, is only meant "all things which are indifferent in themselves." They erroneously applied this maxim of Christian liberty to that which was inherently sinful, and thus were tempted to "make their liberty a cloak of viciousness." St. Paul, as Bengel observes, often, and especially in this Epistle, uses the first person <span class="accented">generally</span> in gnomic or semi-proverbial sentences (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/6-15.htm">1 Corinthians 6:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23, 29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-11.htm">1 Corinthians 14:11</a>).

This is St. Paul's correction of too broad a formula. <span class="cmt_word">Are not expedient.</span> St. Paul illustrates this in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8-10</a>. We have no right to do even that which is innocent, if it be disadvantageous to the highest interests of ourselves or others. "He alone," says St. Augustine, "does not fall into unlawful things who sometimes abstains by way of caution even from lawful ones." <span class="cmt_word">Will</span> <span class="cmt_word">not be brought under the power.</span> The play of words in the original might be imitated by saying, "All things are in my power, but I will not be brought under the power of any." In other words, "boundless intemperance" may become a tyranny. The pretence of moral freedom may end in a moral bondage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Obedience is better than freedom?

Food was a necessity, and the stomach was formed for its assimilation. Fornication is not a venial but "a <span class="accented">deadly</span> sin." It is not a natural necessity, but a consuming evil. The body was created for higher ends - namely, to be a temple of God.

Three great epochs are marked by the use of the word temple. In the Old Testament it means the material temple, the sign of a localized worship and a separated people; in the Gospels our Lord uses it of his own mortal body; in the Epistles it is used (as here) of the body of every baptized Christian, sanctified by the indwelling Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Ye are not your own.</span> We cannot, therefore, use our bodies as though they were absolutely under our own control.

The effect of Christ's death for us is that we are redeemed from slavery and prison, and the right of our possession is with Christ.

When we unduly <span class="accented">press</span> the metaphor, and ask <span class="accented">from whom</span> we were purchased, and <span class="accented">to whom</span> the price was paid, we build up scholastic systems which have only led to error, and respecting which the Church has never sanctioned any exclusive opinion. The thoughts touched upon in this verse are fully developed in the Epistle to the Romans. <span class="cmt_word">Glorify God;</span> by behaving as his redeemed children, and therefore by keeping yourselves pure. In these few brief words St. Paul <span class="accented">sums up</span> all he has said, as he did in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>. In your body. The following words, "and in your spirit, which are God's," are a perfectly correct and harmless gloss, but are not found in the best manuscripts, and are foreign to the drift of the passage.

"Unchastity dishonours God, and that in his own temple (<a href="../../par/romans/2-23.htm">Romans 2:23</a>)" (Meyer).

<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-1.htm">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>). It is <span class="cmt_word">good for a man not to touch a woman.</span> The word used is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, good, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, fair; "an excellent thing." In ver. 26 he limits the word by the clause, "good <span class="accented">for the present necessity."</span> There is no limitation here, and it is probable that St. Paul is quoting the actual words of the letter which he had received from Corinth. There had sprung up among them some antinomians, who, perhaps by perverting his own teaching or that of Apollos, had made liberty a cloak of lasciviousness. In indignant reaction against such laxity, others, perhaps, with Essene proclivities, had been led to disparage matrimony as involving an inevitable stain. Gnosticism, and the spirit which led to it, oscillated between the two extremes of asceticism and uncleanness. Both extremes were grounded on the assertion that matter is inherently evil. Ascetic Gnostics, therefore, strove to destroy by severity every carnal impulse; antinomian Gnostics argued that the life of the spirit was so utterly independent of the flesh that what the flesh did was of no consequence. We find the <span class="accented">germs</span> of Gnostic heresy long before the name appeared. Theoretically, St. Paul inclines to the ascetic view, not in the abstract, but in view of the near advent of Christ, and of the cares, distractions, and even trials which marriage involved in days of struggle and persecution. Yet his wisdom is shown in the cautious moderation with which he expresses himself. The tone of the letter written by Gregory the Great to Augustine with reference to similar inquiries about Saxon converts is very different. The example of St. Paul should have shown the mediaeval moralists and even the later Fathers how wrong it is "to give themselves airs of certainty on points where certainty is not to be had." <span class="accented">Not to touch a woman.</span> St. Paul means generally "not to marry" (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a> [LXX.]). Celibacy under the then existing conditions of the Christian world is, he admits, in itself an honourable and morally salutary thing, though, for the majority, marriage may be a positive duty. He is not dreaming of the <span class="accented">nominal</span> marriages of mediaeval ascetics, for he assumes and directs that all who marry should live in conjugal union. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-2.htm">1 Corinthians 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless, <i>to avoid</i> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless</span>. In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: "If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage." He also says, "I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil." Such reasoning shows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is <span class="accented">kalon</span>; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the "it is a good thing" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be corrected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the example of Christ, who beautified with his presence the marriage at Cana (<a href="../../par/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1, 2</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the primeval law which said, "It is not good for man to be alone" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the fact that marriage is the chosen analogue of the relation between Christ and his Church. But the very phrase he uses, as will be seen by reference to <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>, etc., is a <span class="accented">relative</span> not an <span class="accented">absolute</span> one, and St. Paul uses it here concessively, but with the object of pointing out limitations which almost reversed it. To avoid <span class="cmt_word">fornication</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because o f fornication</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the many forms of impurity which were current every where, but especially at Corinth. Some have argued that St. Paul takes a "low" and "poor" view of marriage by regarding it only in the light of a remedy against fornication. The answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the reason which he assigns is a true reason in itself, and with reference to the masses of mankind; for which reason it is adopted by our Church in her Marriage Service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He is addressing those who were living in a corrupt and semi-heathen atmosphere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He is not here speaking of the idealized and spiritual aspect of marriage, but only of large practical necessities. When he speaks of marriage as a high Christian mystery (as in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>), he adopts a very different tone. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">every man have.</span> A rule, not a mere permission. He here implies the truth that married love bears no analogy whatever to the <span class="accented">vagae libidines</span> of those who live like "natural brute beasts." In marriage the sensuous impulse, by being controlled and placed under religious sanctions is refined and purified from a degradation into a sacrament. Instead of being any longer the source of untold curses to mankind, it becomes the condition of their continuance and an element in their peace, because it is then placed under the blessing of God and of his Church.

Temporary separation for special reasons had been recognized from the earliest times (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye may give yourselves;</span> rather, <span class="accented">ye may have leisure.</span> The verb is in the aorist, which shows that the "leisure" contemplated was for brief periods, not during continuous years.

He means to say that he leaves the <span class="accented">details</span> of their lives, whether celibate or married, to their individual consciences, though with large hearted wisdom and charity he would emancipate them from human and unauthorized restrictions. The clause is not, therefore, a parallel to the restrictions on the authority of his utterances, such as we find in vers. 12, 29, 40, and in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-17.htm">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>.

The "marry" is in the aorist - "to marry once for all," and live in holy married union; the "burn" is in the present - "to be on fire with concupiscence." Marriage once for all is better than continuous lust; the former is permitted, the latter sinful.

The meaning is as follows: - You may, perhaps, plead that, by refusing to sever the union, the believing partner may convert the unbelieving; but that possibility is too distant and uncertain on which to act. St. Peter does indeed show that so blessed a result is possible ("That, if any obey not the Word, they also maybe won... by the conversation of the wives," <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-1.htm">1 Peter 3:1</a>); but he is only speaking of cases in which the unbelieving husband did <span class="accented">not</span> wish the union to be dissolved. The ancient misinterpretation of the passage (due to neglect of the context and of the argument as a whole) viewed it as an argument <span class="accented">for</span> mixed marriages, founded on the chance of thereby winning souls. Most misinterpretations of Scripture have done deadly harm; this one, however, has been overruled for good, and led, as Dean Stanley points out, to such happy marriages as that of Clotilde with Clovis, and Bertha with Ethelbert of Kent.

The early fortunes of Christianity had been almost shipwrecked by the attempt of Jewish rigorists to enforce this odious bondage on the Gentiles, and their deliverance flora it had been due almost solely to St. Paul. It was his inspired insight which had swayed the decision of the synod at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>.); and at a later period his Epistle to the Galatians was the manifesto of Gentile emancipation. He proved that after Christ's death "circumcision" (<span class="accented">peritome</span>) became to Gentiles a mere physical mutilation (<span class="accented">katatome</span>) (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>).

One who was converted whilst he was a slave is not to strive over anxiously for freedom. The word "emancipation" sometimes seems (as in the letter to Philemon) to be "trembling on Paul's lips," but he never utters it, because to do so would have been to kindle social revolt, and lead to the total overthrow of Christianity at the very commencement of its career. Our Lord had taught the apostles to adapt means to ends; and the method of Christianity was to inculcate great principles, the acceptance of which involved, with all the certainty of a law, the ultimate regeneration of the world. Christianity came into the world as the dawn, not as the noon - a shining light, which brightened more and more unto the perfect day. <span class="cmt_word">Care not for it.</span> Do not be troubled by the fact, because in Christ "there is neither bond nor free" (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), and because earthly freedom is as nothing in comparison with the freedom which Christ gives (<a href="../../par/john/8-36.htm">John 8:36</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.</span> The words may mean, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "use freedom" - avail yourself of the opportunity of emancipation; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "use slavery" - be content to remain a slave. In favour of the first interpretation is the fact that there is nothing extravagant or fantastic in Christian morality; and that, considering what ancient slavery was - how terrible its miseries, how shameful and perilously full of temptations were its conditions - it sounds unnatural to advise a Christian slave to remain a slave when he might gain his freedom. Yet the other interpretation, <span class="accented">remain a slave by preference</span>, seems to be required: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> By the strict interpretation of the Greek particles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> By the entire context, which turns on the rule that each man should stay in the earthly condition in which he first received God's call. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> By the fact that even the Stoic moralists - like Epictetus, who was himself a slave - gave similar advice (Epict., 'Dissert.,' 3:26; 'Enchir.,' 10:32.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> By the indifference which St. Paul felt and expressed towards mere earthly conditions (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>), as things of no real significance (<a href="../../par/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> By his appeal to the nearness of the day of Christ (vers. 29-31). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> By the preponderance of high authorities - Chrysostom, Theodoret, Luther, Bengel, De Wette, Meyer, Alford, etc. - in favour of this view <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> By its parallelism to the advice given to Christian slaves in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-2.htm">1 Timothy 6:2</a>, where they are urged to serve Christian masters all the more zealously because they were brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> Lastly, all the apparent harshness of the advice is removed when we remember that St. Paul was probably thinking only of <span class="accented">the Christian slaves of Christian masters</span>, between whom the relation might be as happy as that of Philemon to the forgiven Onesimus.

They knew that the bondage of Satan was so crushing that mere earthly bondage was, in comparison, as nothing; and that the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, though it might seem to take the form of service, was the sole perfect freedom. The freedmen of sin are the most hopeless slaves; the servants of God alone are free (see <a href="../../par/romans/6-22.htm">Romans 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-26.htm">2 Timothy 2:26</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-16.htm">1 Peter 2:16</a>).

It only applies absolutely to times in which the conditions are the same as they then were. The "anxious cares" which marriage involves may be more innocent and less distracting than those which attack the celibate condition; and when that is the case, marriage, on St. Paul's own principle, becomes a duty. Thus some of the best and greatest of our missionaries have found their usefulness as God's messengers vastly increased by marriage, in spite of the awful trials which marriage often involves. The apostles and brethren of the Lord felt the same. St. Paul's opinions here are, as he tells us, <span class="accented">opinions only</span>, and admit of many modifications. Advice given to men and women when Christians believed that the Lord was coming, perhaps in that very age, to judge the world, is not universally applicable to all ages. In St. Paul's later Epistles he does not revert to this advice, but assumes that marriage is the normal condition.

It is quite clear that, if these words are meant to disparage matrimony in comparison with celibacy, or to treat celibacy in the abstract as a holier state that marriage, they have been set aside by the universal practice and theory of the Christian world. But, as we have seen, they are expressed by St. Paul only as a relative and diffident opinion. It is remarkable that not one word is said as to the choice of the virgin herself in the matter, which is one of the most essential points on which the decision must turn. St. Paul, no doubt, assumes the acquiescence or preference of the maiden as one of the elements in the absence of any "need" for her marriage; but also he writes after lifelong familiarity with the all but absolute control exercised by Jewish parents over their youthful daughters.

Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - <span class="accented">The relation of lore to knowledge with respect to the question of eating idol offerings.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As touching things offered unto idols</span>. This was doubtless one of the questions on which the Corinthians had asked for advice. We judge from the tone of the questions to which St. Paul here replies that the majority of the Corinthians, being liberal in their views, held that it was a matter of perfect indifference to eat idol offerings; and that, in acting upon this conviction, they contemptuously overrode the convictions of those who could not help thinking that when they did so they committed a sin. The practical decision of the question was one of immense importance. If it were unlawful under any circumstances to eat idol offerings, then the Gentile convert was condemned to a life of Levitism almost as rigorous as that of the Jew. The distinction between clean and unclean meats formed an insuperable barrier between Jews and Gentiles. Wherever they lived, Jews required a butcher of their own, who had been trained in the rules and ceremonies which enabled him to decide and to ensure that all the meat which they ate should be clean (<span class="accented">tahor</span>), not unclean (<span class="accented">tame</span>). They could touch no meat which was not certified as free from legal blemish or ceremonial pollution by the affixed leaden seal on which was engraved the word "lawful" (<span class="accented">kashar</span>). But Gentiles had always been accustomed to buy meat in the markets. Now, much of this meat consisted of remnants of animals slain as sacrifices, after the priests had had their share. So completely was this case, that the word "to sacrifice" had come to mean "to kill" in Hellenistic Greek. Theophrastus, in his 'Moral Sketches,' defines the close-handed man as one who, at his daughter's wedding feast, sells all the victims offered except the sacred parts; and the shameless person as one who, after offering a sacrifice, salts the victim for future use, and goes out to dine with someone else. The market was therefore stocked with meat which had been connected with idol sacrifices. The Christian could never be sure about any meat which he bought if he held it wrong to partake of these offerings. Further than this, he would  - especially if he were poor - feel it a great privation to be entirely cut off from the public feasts (<span class="accented">sussitia</span>), which perhaps were often his only chance of eating meat at all; and also to be forbidden to take a social meal with any of his Gentile neighbours or relatives. The question was therefore a "burning" one. It involved much of the comfort and brightness of ancient social life (Thucydides, 2:38; Aristotle, 'Eth.,' 7:9, &sect; 5; Cicero, 'Off.,' 2:16; Livy, 8:32, etc.). It will be seen that St. Paul treats it with consummate wisdom and tenderness. His liberality of thought shows itself in this - that he sides with those who took the strong, the broad, the common sense view, that sin is not a mechanical matter, and that sin is not committed where no sin is intended. He neither adopts the ascetic view nor does he taunt the inquirers with the fact that the whole weight of their personal desires and interests would lead them to decide the question in their own favour. On the other hand, he has too deep a sympathy with the weak to permit their scruples to be overruled with a violence which would wound their consciences. While he accepts the right principle of Christian freedom, he carefully guards against its abuse. It might have been supposed that, as a Jew, and one who had been trained as a "Pharisee of Pharisees," St. Paul would have sided with those who forbade any participation in idol offerings. Jewish rabbis referred to passages like <a href="../../par/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/25-2.htm">Numbers 25:2</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-28.htm">Psalm 106:28</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a>; Tobit 1:10, 11. Rabbi Ishmael, in 'Avoda Zara,' said that a Jew might not even go to a Gentile funeral, even if he took with him his own meat and his own servants. The law of the drink offering forbids a Jew to drink of a cask if anyone has even touched a goblet drawn from it with the presumed intention of offering little to the gods. Besides this, the Synod of Jerusalem had mentioned the eating of idol offerings as one of the four things which they forbade to Gentile converts, who were only bound by the Noachian precepts (<a href="../../par/acts/15-29.htm">Acts 15:29</a>). But St. Paul judged the matter independently by his own apostolic authority. The decision of the synod had only had a local validity trod was inapplicable to such a community as that of Corinth. St. Paul had to suffer cruel <span class="accented">misrepresentation</span> and bitter persecution as the consequence of this breadth of view (<a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21-24</a>); but that would not be likely to make him shrink from saying the truth. This treatment of the subject closely resembles that which he subsequently adopted in <a href="../../par/romans/14.htm">Romans 14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">We know that we all have knowledge</span>. It is very probable that this is a semi-ironical quotation of the somewhat conceited remark which had occurred in the letter from Corinth. No doubt there was a sense in which it might (theoretically) be regarded as true; but it was St. Paul's duty both to disparage this kind of knowledge and to show that, after all, there were some among them who did <span class="accented">not</span> possess it (ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">Knowledge puffeth up.</span> The brief energetic clause, "Knowledge puffeth up; love buildeth up," shows the strong feeling with which the apostle enters on the discussion. There is a wide distance between theoretic knowledge and heavenly wisdom (<a href="../../par/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13-18</a>). "He who is full is rich; he who is puffed up is empty" (Stanley). "The first person puffed up was the devil" (Beza). Charity edifieth. There is no reason whatever for the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;</span> sometimes by "love," sometimes by "charity." The fondness for variation which led King James's translators to do so only obscures the identity of thought which prevails among all the apostles respecting the absolute primacy of love as the chief sphere and test of the Christian life. <span class="accented">Edifieth.</span> Helps to build us up as stones in the spiritual temple (ch. 3:9; <a href="../../par/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). "If because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>).

The conceit of knowledge is usually the usurped self assertion of an imaginary infallibility. We only know "in part," and our knowledge, having at the best a purely relative value, is destined to vanish away (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-8.htm">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As he ought to know.</span> True knowledge has in it an element of moral obligation, and saintliness <span class="accented">is</span> knowledge and supersedes the necessity for formal knowledge. Love is knowledge which has passed into heavenly wisdom. The student may say to the mystic, "All that you see I know;" but the mystic may retort," All that you know, I see."

St. Paul purposely alters the symmetry of the phrase. He did not wish to use any terms which would foster the already overgrown conceit of knowledge which was inflating the minds of his Corinthian converts. Further than this, he felt that "God knoweth them that are his" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/3.htm">2 Timothy 3</a>:19), but that, since we are finite and God is infinite, we cannot measure the arm of God by the finger of man. Hence, although it is quite true that "Every one that loveth is begotten of God and <span class="accented">knoweth God"</span> (<a href="../../par/1_john/4-7.htm">1 John 4:7</a>), yet in writing to those whose love was very imperfect, St. Paul deliberately chooses the passive form of expression as in <a href="../../par/galatians/4-9.htm">Galatians 4:9</a>, "Now that ye have known God or are rather <span class="accented">known of God."</span>

The thing which they were eating was, in its own essence, indifferent or clean, but since they could not help esteeming it unclean, they defied a conscientious doubt, and so their conduct, not being of faith, became sinful (<a href="../../par/romans/14-14.htm">Romans 14:14, 23</a>).

If fasting is a help to our spiritual life, then we should practise it, but with the distinct apprehension of the truth that God will think none the better of us merely because we eat less, but only if the fasting be a successful means of making us more pure and more loving. If the Bible had been in the hands of the people during the Middle Ages, this verse would have rendered impossible the idle superstition that to eat meat in Lent was one of the deadliest sins, or that there was any merit whatever in the Lenten fast except as a means of self improvement and self mastery.

It was indeed a "bowing in the house of Rimmon" which could hardly fail to be misunderstood. The very word "idoleum" should have warned them. It was a word not used by Gentiles, and invented by believers in the one God, to avoid the use of "temple" (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) in connection with idols. The Greeks spoke of the "Athenaeum," or "Apolloneum," or "Posideum;" but Jews only of an "idoleum" - a word which (like other Jewish designations of heathen forms of worship) involved a bitter taunt. For the very word <span class="accented">eidolon</span> meant a shadowy, fleeting, unreal image. Perhaps the Corinthian Christians might excuse their boldness by pleading that all the most important feasts and social gatherings of the ancients were held in temples (comp. 1 Macc. 1:47 1 Macc. 10:83). <span class="cmt_word">Be emboldened;</span> rather, <span class="accented">be edified.</span> The expression is a very bold paronomasia. This "edification of ruin" would be all the more likely to ensue because self interest would plead powerfully in the same direction. A little compromise and complicity, a little suppression of opinion and avoidance of antagonism to things evil, a little immoral acquiescence, would have gone very far in those days to save Christians from incessant persecution. Yet no Christian could be "edified" into a more dangerous course than that of defying and defiling his own tender conscience.

But if there is this "ruinous edification" upon the trembling and sandy foundation of a weak conscience, what could possibly follow but a gradual destruction? The <span class="accented">tense</span> is the present (the <span class="accented">praesens futurascens</span>), "and he who is weak, in thy knowledge, <span class="accented">is perishing"</span> - "the brother for whose sake Christ died." The order of the original often gives a force to the words, which it is difficult to reproduce, as here. The word "is perishing" becomes very emphatic by being placed first in the sentence. "Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ died" (<a href="../../par/romans/14-16.htm">Romans 14:16</a>). <span class="accented">Perish</span>; <span class="accented">terrificum verbum.

Being free and an apostle, he could, if he had chosen, have claimed, as others had done, a right to be supported by the Churches to which he preached, he had thought it more for their good to waive this claim, and therefore he had done so at the cost (as appears in many other passages: <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>) of bitter hardship to himself.

It was so essential for him to vindicate, against the subterranean malignity of hostile partisans, his dignity as an apostle, that in asserting that authority he almost loses sight for the time of the main object for which he had alluded to the fact.

This plain meaning, however, involving the assertion that the apostles and desposyni ("the Lord's brethren") were married men, was so distasteful to the morbid asceticism which held celibacy in a sort of Manichaean reverence, that the scribes of the fourth, fifth, and later centuries freely tampered with the text, in the happily fruitless attempt to get rid of this meaning. They endeavoured, by putting the word in the plural or by omitting "wife," to suggest that the women whom the apostles travelled with were "deaconesses." Augustine, Tertullian, Ambrose, and others explain the verse of "ministering women" (<a href="../../par/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2, 3</a>). The false interpretation avenged itself on the bias which led to it. Valla adopts the wilful invention that the apostles, though married, travelled with their wives only as sisters. Such subterfuges have eaten away the heart of honest exegesis from many passages of Scripture, and originated the taunt that it is a "nose of wax," which readers can twist as they like. It was the cause of such shameful abuses and misrepresentations that at last the practice of travelling about with unmarried women, who went under the name of "sisters," "beloved," "companions," was distinctly forbidden by the third canon of the first Council of Nice. Simon Magus might unblushingly carry about with him a Tyrian woman named Helena; but apostles and true Christians would never have been guilty of any conduct which could give a handle to base suspicions. They travelled only with their wives. <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">sister.</span> A Christian woman (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15</a>, etc.). <span class="accented">A wife</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> as a wife. <span class="cmt_word">Other apostles.</span> This is a positive mistranslation for "<span class="accented">the rest of the</span> apostles."

According to the Helvidian theory (to which the plain language of the Gospels seems to point), they were sons of Joseph and Mary. This is the view of St. Clement of Alexandria in ancient times, and writers so different from each other as De Wette, Neander, Osiander, Meyer, Ewald, and Alford, in modern. The theory of Jerome, that they were cousins of Jesus, being sons of Alphseus and Mary, a sister of the Virgin, is on every ground absolutely untenable, and it was half dropped even by St. Jerome himself, when it had served his controversial purpose. The theory of Epiphanius, that they were sons of Joseph by a previous marriage, is possible, but incapable of proof. It comes from a tainted source - the apocryphal Gospels (see my 'Early Days of Christianity,' 2). <span class="cmt_word">Cephas</span>. St. Paul also uses the Aramaic name in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.

If, then, St. Paul toiled at the dull, mechanical, despised, and ill paid work of tent making, he did so, not because it was, in the abstract, his duty to earn his own living, but because he chose to be nobly independent, that the absolute disinterestedness of his motives might be manifest to all the world. For this reason even when he was most in need he would never receive assistance from any Church except that of Philippi, where he had at least one wealthy convert, and where he was beloved with a peculiar warmth of affection.

St. Paul did not intend to say, "God has no care for oxen;" for he knew that "his tender mercies are over all his works:" he only meant in Semitic fashion to say that the precept was much more important in its human application; and herein he consciously or unconsciously adopts the tone of Philo's comment on the same passage ('De Victim Offerentibus,' &sect; 1), that, for present purposes, oxen might be left out of account. The rabbinic Midrash, which gave this turn to the passage, was happier and wiser than most specimens of their exegesis. St. Paul sets the typico allegorical interpretation above the literal in this instance (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>), because he regards it as the more important. It is a specimen of the common Jewish exegetic method of <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> or <span class="accented">minori ad magus.</span> Luther's curious comment is: "God cares for all things; but he does not care that anything should be <span class="accented">written</span> for oxen, because they cannot <span class="accented">read"!</span>

It should be carefully observed that St. Paul is here describing the innocent concessions and compliances which arise from the harmless and generous condescension of a loving spirit. He never sank into the fear of man, which made Peter at Antioch unfaithful to his real principles. He did not allow men to form from his conduct any mistaken inference as to his essential views.

St, Paul tried to look at every subject, so far as he could do so innocently, from 'their point of view (<a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.).

The need for this qualification is shown by the fact that in the Clementine writings, in the spurious letter of Peter to James, St. Paul is surreptitiously calumniated as <span class="accented">"the lawless one</span>." Even the Gentiles were "not without law to God" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14, 15</a>).

This condescension laid him open to the malicious attacks of religious enemies (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>).
