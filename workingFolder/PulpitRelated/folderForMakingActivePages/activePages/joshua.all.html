Melchizedek in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a>). The <span class="accented">name</span> given to the king of Jerusalem was good enough, and no doubt was a survival of earlier and purer times. In the days of Melchizedek the name corresponded to the character. <span class="cmt_word">Jerusalem</span>. Hebrew, <span class="accented">Jerushalaim</span>, with the usual dual termination. It has been generally supposed to be the same with Salem, or rather Shalem, the city of which Melehizedek was king, and this is supported by the fact that the name of Salem is given to Jerusalem in <a href="../../par/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>. But it is by no means certain that this is the case. The first to dispute the identity of the two places was St. Jerome, who declares that the Salem of Melchizedek was eight miles from Scythopolis, and that the ruins of the palace of Melchizedek could still be seen there (see also <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>). The term Salem, as indicative of the security and strength of Jerusalem, might not unnaturally be applied to it by the Psalmist; while; on the other hand, the dual form of Jerusalem seems difficult to account for on the theory of the identity of Jerusalem and Salem. This dual form has been a difficulty to critics; and Mr. Grove, in the 'Dictionary of the Bible,' conjectures that it may have arisen from an attempt to twist the archaic Phoenician form into agreement with the more modern Hebrew idiom, just as the Greeks afterwards twisted the name into Hierosolyma, or the holy Solyma. But a simpler explanation may be found in the fact that Jerusalem, like many other cities, consisted of two parts, the upper and the lower town (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a> with ver. 1, 7 and 21, and <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-8</a>), while in earlier times the upper or lower town alone existed. Plural names of cities were not uncommon in later ages, as Athenae and Thebae. The name has been variously derived. Some have thought that as it is also called Jebus (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/19-10.htm">Judges 19:10</a>), from its being the chief city of the Jebusites, it was originally Jebus-salem, and hence by a corruption Jerusalem. But this derivation has now been abandoned, and opinions differ as to whether it is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> signifying "peaceful inheritance" (Ewald, Keil), or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> "peaceful settlement" (Gesenius, Lee). Gesenius objects to the former derivation that it would require dagesh in the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The fathers and mediaeval divines, misled by Origen, translate it "vision of peace." This translation is alluded to in the well-known hymns <span class="accented">Urbs beata Sion</span> and O <span class="accented">quanta qualia.</span> Origen supposed it to come from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>. Another difficult question is <span class="accented">when</span> the name was given, for there can be little doubt that the Book of Joshua was written before the time of David. It is possible that the name may have been given by the Jebusites themselves in consequence of their secure possession of it, notwithstanding the subjugation of the surrounding country by the Israelites. And when David had seized upon it and made it his capital, he would not be likely to change so suitable a name. For the Jebusites, evidently by their invariable position last among the nations of Canaan, the most insignificant among them, were enabled to defy the Israelite power long after their more powerful neighbours had succumbed. and David no doubt chose the situation of Jerusalem for his capital not only because, unlike Hebron, it enabled him to dwell among his own people without cutting himself off from intercourse with the other tribes of Israel; but because, as a mountain fastness remote from the plains of Esdraelon and the Orontes, which were the great highways of the Egyptian and Assyrian kings on their military expeditions, it would enable him to consolidate his power, and to secure that empire which became his from the force of his genius and the favour of God. We may remark upon the antecedent probability of the fact that the king of a place situated as Jerusalem is should stand at the head of this league. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">That they feared greatly, because Gibeon <i>was</i> a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai, and all the men thereof <i>were</i> mighty.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they feared greatly.</span> Joshua had certainly obtained an excellent strategic position in the heart of the country; but it was not this which apparently most alarmed the kings who constituted the confederacy, though they did not fail to observe that, as the words "and were among them" show. It was the weight and importance of Gibeon itself, and the fact that its inhabitants were now enlisted, not on the side of the Canaanites, but against them. <span class="cmt_word">As one of the royal cities.</span> Observe the minute accuracy of the historian. No king is mentioned in the narrative in ch. 9. We now earn indirectly that they had none. The Vulgate misses the point of the historian by leaving out "as" altogether. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hoham king of Hebron.</span> It was a powerful confederacy which the Phoenician tribes in their desperation formed against Joshua. At its head stood the king of Jerusalem, which, from its central situation and its almost impregnable position (see notes on Joshua 15:63), might naturally stand at the head of such a league. Next came Hebron, which, from its importance from an early period (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27</a>), and the gigantic stature of its inhabitants (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2</a>), as well as its daughter cities (ver. 37), would prove a formidable addition to the strength of the confederates. Colossal blocks of stone, testifying to the presence there of the primeval races of Palestine, are still to be found in the neighbourhood. Hebron stands in "the hill country of Judaea." Its situation has been much admired, standing as it does nearly 3,000 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, and commanding the most extensive views of the Holy Land. This is one of the most interesting in its reminiscences of all the cities in Palestine. Here Abraham pitched his tent, near the "oak of Mature." Here was the burying place of Abraham and Sarah, which has been kept in memory by an unwavering tradition even to this very day; and, sacred ground though it be to the Mohammedans, was opened to the Prince of Wales and his companions in 1862. This was the inheritance of Caleb, and here, where the affections of every Israelite would most closely centre, David fixed his capital until compelled to change it by reasons to which we have already referred. Hebron seems to have been successively occupied by various members of the Phoenician confederation. It was first founded, we learn, seven years before Zoan in Egypt (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a>). When we first hear of it, it is in the possession of Mature the Amorite (<a href="../../par/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>). In <a href="../../par/genesis/28.htm">Genesis 28</a>, it has clearly passed into the possession of the Hittites, and the mention of the children of Heth is too express for us to suppose that the term Hittite is used generally for the inhabitants of the land. At a much later period the Canaanites, or lowlanders, had, strangely enough, obtained possession (<a href="../../par/judges/1-10.htm">Judges 1:10</a>), and here again the accurate acquaintance of the historian with the names of the tribes (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4, 21, 26, 35</a>) forbids us to suppose that he is speaking loosely. Piram king of Jarmuth. Jarmuth is mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>, and in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-29.htm">Nehemiah 11:29</a>. It has been identified with Yarmuk (see Robinson, II. sec. 11, with whom Vandevelde and Conder agree), where there are the remains of very ancient walls and cisterns. Of its size and importance in the time of Joshua we know nothing. Japhia king of Lachish. Like Jarmuth, Lachish was in the Shephe-lah, or lowlands, of Judah, and we frequently hear of it in the later history of the Jews, as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>; also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>. It has been identified by Von Raumer and Vandevelde, whom Keil follows, with Um Lakis, though Robinson ('Biblical Researches' II. 388) denies this on the authority of Eusebius and Jerome; "but not on any reasonable grounds" (Vandevelde). This is the more clear in that Robinson rejects the authority of the Onomasticon in the case of Eglon. Um Lakis is only an hour and a quarter's journey from Ajlann or Eglon, and this narrative (vers. 31-36) shows that Eglon was on the way from Lachish to Hebron. Conder, in his 'Handbook' and in 'Pal. Exploration Fund Quart. Paper,' Jan., 1878, p. 20, suggests Tell el Hesy, a name which he thinks may "be a corruption of Lachlsh." This is a great mound on the main road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza. It is a strong argument for Um Lakis that there are an immense number of instances where the places retain their ancient names. The strongest argument for Tell el Hesy is that Laehish was evidently a place of some strength. Joshua, we read (ver. 32), "encamped against it" (this is said only of La-chish and Eglon), and "took it on the second day," and it successfully resisted the king of Assyria. Now Tell el Hesy was a "great mound" (Conder); but Um Lakis is described by Vandevelde as situated on "a low mound." <span class="cmt_word">Debir king of Eglon.</span> This, the modern Ajlan, according to the best authorities, was on the road from Eleutheropolis to Gaza, not far from Lachish. Ruins are to be found there; but we have no means of ascertaining the size and importance of the town in the time of Joshua. The LXX., here and elsewhere in this chapter, render by <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;</span>. In <a href="../../par/joshua/12-11.htm">Joshua 12:11</a> they read <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x2e;</span> There is considerable similarity between Gimel and Daleth, Mem and Nun in the ancient Hebrew character. From this a various reading no doubt resulted.

Here there is nothing to guide us in the decision whether the passage indicates the purpose or the result. It is in keeping with the whole history, and is one of the life-like touches with which it abounds, that the king of Jerusalem does not dare to suggest an attack upon Joshua. He can only venture upon assailing Gibeon, standing in less fear of it than of the divinely protected invaders, and hoping at least by this measure to deprive Joshua of formidable allies. "Cure anima humana Verbo Dei se sociaverit, dubitare non debet, statim se inimicos habituram, et eos, quos ante habuerit amicos, in adversa-rios vertendos" (Orig., Hom. 2 on Joshua. See also Ecclus. 2:1; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/3-12.htm">2 Timothy 3:12</a>). "As Satan, so wicked men, cannot abide to lose any of their communitie. If a convert come home, the angels welcome him with songs, the Devils follow him with uprore and furie, his old Partners with seorne and obloquie" (Bp. Hall).

As a matter of fact, the kings who formed the confederacy principally inhabited the lowlands, as we have seen. No one could have hit upon this apparent contradiction yet real agreement but one whose narrative was compiled from authentic sources.

Speaking of the view from Beth-horon, he says, The prospect included the hill country and the plain as far as the eye could reach ....

See <a href="../../par/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. This place is known to after Jewish history, having been fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>), besieged by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/34-7.htm">Jeremiah 34:7</a>), which shows it to have been a place of some importance. It continued to be inhabited after the captivity (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>), and has been identified by Vandevelde with Ahbek, a place standing upon a mountain. He supposes it to have been identical with the Aphek in Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>). But this would be better identified with Aphekah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>). Lieut. Conder ('Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper,' Oct., 1875) identifies it with a place called Deir el Aashek, eight miles north of Shochoh. But apparently in the 'Handbook' he has abandoned this idea, though he makes no reference to this passage. And unto Makkedah. One of the lowland cities of Judah (see <a href="../../par/joshua/15-41.htm">Joshua 15:41</a>). Vandevelde identifies it with Summeil, a place where there are the ruins of a very ancient city (see ver. 28), built of large uncemented stones, a sign of great antiquity, and a large cave, such as that described in ver. 16. See Robinson, vol. 2. p. 368, who gives not a hint, however, that it is to be identified with Makkedah, nor does he mention a cave. Lieut. Conder ('Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper,' July, 1875) identifies it with the present E1 Moghar (The Caves), twenty-five miles from Gibeon along the valley of Ajalon, where several caves are found, the only ones, apparently, in the district. Summeil is a very long distance from Gibeon, and if we are to identify this with Makkedah, which there appears no ground for doing, supernatural assistance would have been required in more than one way for so protracted a pursuit during the same day.

And even if there were not sufficient evidence of the fall of hailstones large enough to do great destruction to man and beast, we might fall back upon the theory that this was a miraculous hailstorm, since the whole history teems with miraculous intervention. But in point of fact this is unnecessary. We need not go further back than the famous storm of August 2nd, 1879, for an account of hailstones of enormous size falling within fifty miles of London. And in tropical climates still more destructive storms are of no infrequent occurrence. Every treatise on physical geography teems with instances. Masius refers to the well known story of the relief afforded by a sudden shower to Marcus Aurelius and his army, which he follows Eusebius in thinking attributable to Christian prayers, but which the emperor, in a medal struck on the occasion, attributed to Jupiter Pluvius (see Neander, 'Hist. of Christian Church,' vol. 1.). He also fcites the verses of Claudian on a similar victory of Theodosius: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"O nimium dilecte Deo, tibi militat aether<br />Et conjurati veniunt ad praelia venti."</span> They were more which died with hailstones. A conclusive proof, both to the Israelites and their antagonists, that the victory was owing rather to the favour of God than to the power of man, and suggesting the exclamation of the Psalmist, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Thy Name give glory" (<a href="../../par/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).

So also in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a>, where our version renders "because of." In the latter part of this verse it signifies "before" (sec note there). In a passage so much disputed as this it is necessary to remember the indefiniteness of the original. Though the rendering, "to the Lord," is the natural and obvious one, the other meanings cannot be excluded. The more probable rendering is that in the text. Yet, as no address to God is afterwards recorded, the meaning may be "by," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by the inspiration of, or "because of," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on account of the great success God had vouchsafed to him, and which he earnestly desired to complete; or "before," as though Joshua spoke with a consciousness of God's immediate presence and help. For a full discussion of this remarkable passage the reader is referred to the Introduction. In the sight of Israel. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, "before the eyes of." This brings the scene vividly before our eyes: the storm rolling away over the mountains, the enemy in full retreat and wild confusion, the sun bursting forth from behind the clouds, and the leader of the Israelites, in the sight of all his troops, perhaps on the crest of the eminence on which Gibeon stands, or perhaps at Upper Beth-heron (see note on ver. 10), uttering his sublime apostrophe to the "two great lights" which God had given to mankind, not to withdraw their presence until the Lord had "avenged him of his adversaries." The battle had been short, but decisive. The Israelites had no doubt (ver. 9) fallen upon the enemy unawares at the dawn of day as they were preparing for the attack on Gibeon. A few hours had sufficed to put them to the rout, but the utmost expedition would be necessary to complete their destruction before the darkness set in. Hence the ejaculation of the Jewish commander as the difficulty of the task he had imposed upon himself, namely, of utterly annihilating that vast host before light failed, flashed upon him. <span class="cmt_word">Sun, stand thou still.</span> The poetic form of this passage is clear to every one who has the smallest acquaintance with the laws of Hebrew poetry. For the Book of Jasher, from which it is apparently a quotation (see Introduction, Sec. 2). <span class="cmt_word">Stand thou still.</span> This is not the literal rendering of the original. In no other passage has the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> this sense. The sense "stand still" here would seem to be an inference from ver. 14. The literal rendering is, "be dumb." Hence in <a href="../../par/exodus/15-16.htm">Exodus 15:16</a>, and in <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-10.htm">Lamentations 2:10</a>, it signifies to be dumb with amazement or terror. In <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-9.htm">1 Samuel 14:9</a> it seems to mean, "stay your advance" ("tarry," Authorised Version), and the word rendered "stand still" in the last part of the verse is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span>. See also <a href="../../par/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a> (Itch.), where it is rendered "be still," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "be silent;" and <a href="../../par/job/30-27.htm">Job 30:27</a>, and <a href="../../par/lamentations/2-18.htm">Lamentations 2:18</a>. The word must not therefore be pressed to mean that the sun's course was completely arrested in the heavens. All that can be assumed is that it did not set until the people were avenged of their enemies. The passage is evidently part of a triumphal song, like that recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/5.htm">Judges 5</a>, where in ver. 20 there is a very similar thought, which no one ever thinks of interpreting literally. <span class="cmt_word">Upon Gibeon.</span> Beth-heron was northwest of Gibeon. The meaning of the phrase would perhaps be, "Sun, rest thou (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, cease not to shine) in (or upon) Gibeon." <span class="cmt_word">In the valley of Ajalon.</span> The valley <span class="accented">of the deer</span>, according to the Hebrew. The word for valley is <span class="accented">Emek</span> here (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3be;</span>). See note on Joshua 8:13. alert became afterwards a Levitical city (see <a href="../../par/joshua/21-24.htm">Joshua 21:24</a>), and was in the inheritance of Dan (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-42.htm">Joshua 19:42</a>). See also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-31.htm">1 Samuel 14:31</a>. It has been identified with the modern Yale (so Robinson, Vandevelde, and Conder), and was therefore four hours' journey westward from Gibeon. It was possibly near the time of full moon, and Joshua called for the light of the moon to help him when the sun had set. The very fact of his having called upon the moon to come to his assistance is an argument against the literal interpretation of the passage. The moon could have been no help to him as long as the sun was in the heavens. It is thought by some that the moon must have been already in the heavens, or why should Joshua have addressed her? This may have been the case, and he might thus have adjured the moon to give him her help after the sun had gone down, by which time he would have arrived at Ajalon, a supposition which is quite consistent with probability. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. <i>Is</i> not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The moon stayed.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span>, which <span class="accented">does</span> mean to stand still, is used here. See also <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a>. But if we are to apply it to the moon and not to the <span class="accented">light</span> of the moon, where would be the use of the moon's standing still in the valley of Ajalon, when she would be low down in the sky westward, and incapable of rendering Joshua any help? If we regard the <span class="accented">light</span> of the moon as meant, there is no phrase more common in poetry and poetic prose than to speak of moonbeams "resting" upon an object. <span class="cmt_word">The people.</span> The word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. See note on Joshua 5:6. <span class="cmt_word">The Book of Jasher.</span> See Introduction, Note 6. <span class="cmt_word">And the sun stood still.</span> Here the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> is used of the sun. But, as before, it refers naturally enough to the sun's <span class="accented">light.</span> The declining sun continued to shine upon Gibeon, and in the neighbourhood, upon the descent from Beth-heron the Upper, and on the whole region throughout which the fugitive Canaanites were scattered. We need not suppose that <span class="accented">all</span> the discomfited host fled in one direction, and possibly in the neighbourhood of Gibeon itself there remained quite enough of the scattered portions of the host to need urgently the sun's light to complete their destruction. <span class="cmt_word">The midst.</span> The Hebrew here is not the usual word for midst. It signifies literally, the <span class="accented">half. <span class="cmt_word"></span>About a whole day.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">as a perfect day.</span> The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Vulgate, "Non festinavit occumbere spatio unius dict." What is the precise meaning of this passage it is difficult to say. The language is very obscure. It has been usually interpreted to mean that the sun remained in the heavens twelve hours longer than usual. But this, though the most natural, is by no means the only interpretation of the passage. The words, "did not hasten to go down as a perfect day," cannot be <span class="accented">proved</span> to have this meaning. In fact, it is difficult to fix a precise meaning on them. They belong rather to the domain of poetry than history, and their language is that of hyperbole rather than of exact narration of facts. Consequently, we are not entitled to build conclusions upon them, or draw arguments from them. It seems tolerably clear that twelve additional hours could hardly have been required by the Israelites for the complete extermination of their enemies.

Also see note on Joshua 2:22. But Lieut. Conder believes that in this particular neighbourhood there were few caves. See note on Makkedah above, ver. 10. For "these five kings" the original has simply "five kings." The order of the narrative is somewhat interrupted by the introduction of Joshua's adjuration, and the account of the flight of the five kings. Compare ver. 11 with ver. 20.

Most likely the pursuit lasted one or two days. After the return to Makkedah the execution of the kings was carried out with much ceremony (ver. 24), and their bodies hung up before all Israel, not so much as a memorial of the victory, as to impress upon the Israelites the duty of exterminating their enemies, a duty which the after history of the twelve tribes shows them to have been very prone to forget. <span class="cmt_word">None moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">He did not sharpen against the children of Israel, against a man, his tongue.</span> The Hebrew construction here is somewhat unusual. Houbigant and Maurer suppose that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b5;</span>is a mistake of the copyist and that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> is the subject of the sentence. They would translate as the LXX., "no man muttered with his tongue against the children of Israel." But Keil and Rosenmuller prefer a rendering agreeing with that of the Authorised Version, <span class="accented">node moved</span> (or <span class="accented">sharpened</span>) <span class="accented">his tongue against the children of Israel, not against a single man of them.</span> And this is a far more forcible way of expressing the awe in which they were held.

Not only is the article used instead of the relative pronoun <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;</span> which occasionally occurs, as in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-17.htm">1 Chronicles 29:17</a>, but the form of the verb is Arabic. None of the commentators give a satisfactory explanation of this fact, and perhaps the suggestion of Houbigant is to be adopted, that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> which follows <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> has been accidentally doubled by the transcriber. Kennicott thinks that some Arabic transcriber has inadvertently given the verb an Arabic form, which is very improbable. Keil thinks that it is a sort of intermediate step between the more ancient termination <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> and the more modern one in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. But if so, it is strange that we should only meet with it twice in Holy Scripture. Haverniek (Introduction, &sect; 22 B) regards it as an archaic form. <span class="cmt_word">Put your feet on the necks of these kings.</span> This was a most common Oriental practice, as the Assyrian and Egyptian monuments prove. Calvin explains the otherwise "boundless arrogance" of the act by the Divine command. But, as Keil remarks, it was a "symbolical act, intended to inspirit the people." See also <a href="../../par/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>. The fact that this was done, not by Joshua, but by the captains (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>; from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to cut off), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the inferior officers of the Israelitish army, makes a wide distinction between this and the usual arrogance of Oriental conquerors, and marks the very great moral superiority of Joshua over any other leader known to history either in his own time or in subsequent ages. For whereas the act was usually an act of arrogant triumph on the part of the leader himself, here the leader modestly disclaims any such superiority, and calls upon his subordinates to assume it, as a sign that the Israelitish people, whose representatives they were, <span class="accented">should</span> triumph over all their enemies. The next verse explains the reason of the injunction. To the kings themselves no insolence was displayed, for it was but the well known and perfectly understood symbol of their undeniable condition of subjection at that moment. But, of course, we are not to look for that gentleness and humanity in so far distant an age, which would at the present day be shown by a Christian general, or even for the moderation and clemency displayed in the hour of victory by an Alexander, a Scipio, a Caesar, trained under the maxims of Latin and Greek philosophy. See a fuller discussion of the subject in the Introduction. Origen remarks here, "Atque utinam Dominus meus Jesus filius Dei mihi istud concedat, et jubeat me pedibus meis conculcare spiritum fornicationis, et caleare super cervices spiritus iracundise et furoris, calcare avaritise daemonem, caicare jactantiam, conterere pedibus superbiae spiritum." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/10-25.htm">Joshua 10:25</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">Fear not, nor be dismayed.</span> As Keil remarks, these arc the very words which God used to Joshua when He bade him enter upon his great task.

So now may the experience of one Christian in the warfare against the powers of evil be imparted as encouragement to another. <span class="cmt_word">Ye fight.</span> The word "ye" is emphatic. Perhaps Joshua would convey the idea that the Israelites were not to attribute their success to their leader, or to any Divine favor resting upon him as an individual, but to believe that, as long as they served God faithfully, His presence would be as much with them as it was at that particular time and under that particular leader. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a></div><div class="verse">And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And hanged them.</span> This was also a symbolical act, intended to encourage Israel in their warfare.

Joshua set the example to the Israelites of a strict observance of the law. And we may observe that this law is only to be found in Deuteronomy. On the "Deuteronomist" theory we have to suppose that the Deuteronomist, with a lynx eye to the chance of recommending the provisions which he had invented, and to the importance of representing Joshua as a strict observer of them, inserted this piece of detail with an obvious purpose. It is a wonder that this should be almost the only "Deuteronomist" precept thus emphasised. We find it noticed above (<a href="../../par/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>), and in both cases the obvious explanation is that this sign of triumph made a great impression on those who witnessed it, and that it was carried out in strict fulfilment of enactments already existing. On the other hand, as we have seen, there is no attempt in <a href="../../par/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a> to emphasise thus the obedience to the command in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2-8</a>.

It is worthy of remark that while Libnah, Debir, and Makkedah are mentioned among the cities destroyed in this campaign, though they are not named among the cities of the league, Jarmuth, on the contrary, though it is one of the cities named, does not appear to have been taken with the rest. <span class="cmt_word">With the edge of the sword</span>.

See note on ch. 9:1; also <a href="../../par/joshua/15-42.htm">Joshua 15:42</a>. It became a Levitical city. It revolted from Judah in the reign of Joram (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>). It seems to have returned to its allegiance, since we find it not included in the conquest of Israel by Shalmaneser, while, on the other hand, it undergoes a siege among the fenced cities of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-8.htm">2 Kings 19:8</a>). The cause (see Blunt 'Undesigned Coincidences,' part 2:27) of this return is not far to seek. The Levites cast off the authority of Joram "because he had forsaken the Lord God of his fathers" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10, 11</a>). It probably remained independent - for it was not likely to have joined itself to Israel, either from geographical position or religious principles - until the accession of Joash terminated the connection between the royal house of Judah and the descendants of the wicked Ahab. Libnah, or the white city, has been identified with Tell es Safieh, the <span class="accented">Blanche Garde</span> of the Crusaders. See Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' pp. 207, 258. Lieut. Conder, however, supposes it to have been Eleutheropolis, now Beit Jibrin, and Capt. Warren believes he has found it at Ibna. Vanclevelde suggests yet another site. But Lieut. Conder's description of the hill on which Tell es Safieh stands as "a white precipice of many hundred feet" ('Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper,' July, 1875), would account for the name Libnah.

Accordingly, in spite of the alleged carelessness of our compiler, who is credited with having put together shreds of the various narratives in the most perfunctory manner, he takes care to add (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>) that the inhabitants of Gezer were not driven out. In like manner, with the single exception of Hebron, the people of which must have at once chosen another king, he carefully omits the mention of the king in the cities which had lost their kings in the battle before Gibeon. See also note on ver. 32. Thus a careful examination of the narrative puts the care and accuracy of the history very carefully before us. With regard to the situation of Gezer, it has been accurately determined by the Palestine Exploration Society. The Levitical boundaries, with Greek and Hebrew inscriptions, signifying the boundary of Gezer, have been discovered by M. Ganneau (see 'Quarterly Paper' for October, 1874). Tell el Jezer was first identified by M. Ganneau with Gezer. Continuing his researches, he found on a slab of rock nearly horizontal and very nearly two inches in length a bilingual inscription, in Greek and Hebrew, signifying the limit of Gezer (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>). Since the inscription is Greek and Talmudical in its character (the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> has not the signification of "limit" in the Hebrew Scriptures) it must, in spite of the early form of the letters, belong to a period long subsequent to the Babylonish captivity. M. Ganneau suggests the Maccabean period. (See below.) But it is, no doubt, the result of a remeasurement in accordance with the rules laid down in <a href="../../par/numbers/35-5.htm">Numbers 35:5</a>. Some have supposed the above to have been designed to fix the limit of the sabbath day's journey. But it is more probable that it served as a boundary between the Levitical and the tribal territory, the more especially as the words are so placed as to be read by one <span class="accented">entering</span> the town. It was a Levitical city (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-67.htm">1 Chronicles 6:67</a>), or at least assigned to the Levites; but <a href="../../par/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a> shows that the Canaanitish population lived on with the Levites. It may have been the nondescript character of the population that caused it to fall an easy prey to Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>, where note that the Canaanites had never been driven out); but when Solomon espoused his daughter he restored Gezer to Israel. Under the same name Gazara it plays a conspicuous part in the wars of the Maccabees (1 Macc. 9:52; 2 Macc. 10:32). From the latter passage we learn that it was "a very strong hold." It retains its old name, being now known as Tell el Jezer.

Joshua "passes" from one city to another in the plain. He "goes up" to Hebron, which is situated among the hills. See note on ver. 3; cf. also <a href="../../par/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span>. Commentators of the school of Maurer and De Wette regard the taking of Hebron and Debir as irreconcilable with <a href="../../par/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-13.htm">Joshua 15:13-17</a>. But this is by no means certain. The operations of Joshua were sudden, and, so far as they went, decisive, But it is never pretended that his conquest of southern Palestine was complete. It is impossible to assert this in the face of such passages as <a href="../../par/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>, 17:12, 13, and especially in the face of such a fact as the continued existence of the Philistine power. Joshua extirpated the inhabitants of the cities he took, but there were many others - some of at least equal importance  - which he did not take. We may instance Gaza, Garb, and Ashdod. See <a href="../../par/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>. Their inhabitants came and occupied again the cities which Joshua had destroyed, first when he was engaged in operations in the north and west, and again when the Israelites had begun to repose upon their laurels, and to neglect the task God had set them, namely, the complete extermination of the Canaanite race from Palestine. Thus Joshua returned from the north and found a large part of the country he had subdued reoccupied by the giant tribes of the south. He "cut them off from Hebron and Debir," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he compelled them to evacuate those cities, but there was no necessity for a second of either. Yet at a later period they still lurked in the neighborhood (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12</a>), perhaps in the mountain fastnessess (a very common thing in the history of nations, as the history of our own country, of the Basques in the Pyrenees, and of Swiss freedom shows), and were strong enough to regain Debir (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a>). Jerusalem itself (see note on ver. 1) had a similar fate. After the capture of Jerusalem the Israelites were unable to hold it permanently (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8, 21</a>). And such expressions as "all the cities thereof" show that the south of Palestine was thickly populated. Each city was, like Gibeon, the head of a small confederacy. And as the chief cities smitten by Joshua would have been but a tithe of the confederations existing in the south, the task of reoccupying must have been an easy one. It seems to be implied in <a href="../../par/judges/1.htm">Judges 1</a>. that Caleb took Hebron and Debir after Joshua's death.

His march was now southward instead of eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Debir</span>. A city of importance, since only Hebron and it are mentioned in the history of the campaign as having cities dependent on them. It is also called Kirjath-Sepher (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-15.htm">Joshua 15:15</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-11.htm">Judges 1:11</a>), and Kirjath-Sannah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-49.htm">Joshua 15:49</a>). The first name signifies "the city of the hook," from whence it has been argued that it was the seat of what we should now call an university. Recent discoveries have rendered this supposition by no means improbable. The Hittite remains have proved that people to have been a more influential and intellectual people in early times than had ever been supposed until lately. Others have suggested that it was the abode of an oracle, which is rendered probable if Debir be connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> word. The meaning of Kirjath-Sannah is by no means clear. Some have derived it from the Arabic "sunna," <span class="accented">law</span>, or <span class="accented">doctrine</span> (whence the Sunnite sect among the Mohammedans), and some from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, a palm branch, or more probably a thornbush. Ritter thinks that both Kirjath-Sepher and Kirjath-Sannah imply the place where the public records were kept. Perhaps what is meant is that, like Mona or Anglesea to the Druids, Debir was the home of the Canaanitish religious traditions. Debir appears as Dapur in the list of fortified cities in Canaan captured by Seti I. and Rameses II. of Egypt. They are depicted on the monumental records. See Tomkins, 'Studies of the Time of Abraham,' p. 84. Debir has lately been identified by the Palestine Survey. Lieut. Conder ('Quarterly Paper,' Jan., 1875, p. 48) fixes it at El Dho-heriyeh or Dhaheriyeh. The identification depends upon the passages <a href="../../par/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>, and <a href="../../par/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>. See note on the former. The grounds of the identification are as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Debir (see last note) was southward of Hebron. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The circumstances require an arid locality, but within a moderate distance two sets of springs, or pools of water. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> There must be signs of ancient dwellings, and, as Debir was a royal city, it must be the converging point of the various roads. All these conditions are fulfilled by El Dhaheriyeh. The rock excavations, the sign of the most ancient dwellings, are plentiful there; ancient roads are found converging in all directions. And six miles and a half north of the village fourteen springs, or pools, are found, some at the head of the valley, some lower down, and some at a lower level still. The distance of these from Debit is in exact accordance with the narrative. They are too far off to be included as a matter of course within the boundaries of Debit, and would naturally enough become the object of such a petition as Achsah is said to have preferred in the passage above cited. Wilson's 'Lands of the Bible,' 1:351, speaks of the excavations here, but does not appear to have been aware of their antiquity. He describes the inhabitants as living in them. But he remarks - and it is a singular confirmation of Lieut. Conder's subsequent discovery - that the sites of five out of the ten cities mentioned in conjunction with Debir in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-48.htm">Joshua 15:48-51</a>, are to be found in the immediate neighbourhood of Dhaheriyeh (ibid. p. 353). From this passage and some others, however, Knobel has anticipated Lieut. Conder's suggestion. He describes Thaharijeh, as he calls it, as on the high road from Gaza, with ruins of great antiquity, situated in the midst of a country which, though barren in appearance and destitute of trees and arable land, is yet rich in pasture. But he says nothing of the springs, the only thing wanting to make the evidence complete. Ritter's description of the place as the "first place of importance" on arriving in Palestine from the south, and as the meeting place of the roads from Beersheba, from Gaza and Egypt, and from Petra and Sinai, confirm Lieut. Conder's view, but Bitter does not seem to have identified it with Debir, though he regards it as "one of a series of fortresses designed to protect the southern frontier of Judaea" (3:193, 288). It became a Levitical city (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-15.htm">Joshua 21:15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-58.htm">1 Chronicles 6:58</a>).

He smote "the hills," or rather the "hill country," a tract of country extending from Jerusalem southward. This limestone range formed the watershed between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. The south, now often spoken of by travellers by its Hebrew name of Negeb, was, as the name signifies, an almost waste district of limestone hills (cf. the Mount Halak, or <span class="accented">smooth mountain</span>, of <a href="../../par/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). It was once more fertile than it is at present, but could never have been a very fruitful region. As Knobel says, it is midway between waste and fertile land. It possesses grass and herbs and flowers, especially in the rainy season, and is thus suitable for pasture. But there are many tracts of sand and heath, and it is not watered by brooks, characteristics it has in common with the wilderness. It was also hilly, though not so precipitous as the mountain district. Tristram ('Land of Israel,' pp. 365, 366) describes some of the mountains as rising gradually to a height of 3,200 feet. Bartlett, however, who devoted more time to the south country, describes it as treeless, but fertile as a corn producing country, and as very distinct in its physical features from the desert, or what is known as the "Wilderness of Judaea" ('From Egypt to Palestine,' ch. 17, 18.). The best description of this region is found, however, in 'Scripture Lands,' by the late Rev. G. S. Drew. He says (p. 6), "For a few weeks late in spring time a smiling aspect is thrown over the broad downs, when the ground is reddened by the anemone in contrast with the soft white of the daisy and the deep yellow of the tulip and marigold. But this flush of beauty soon passes, and the permanent aspect of the country is not wild indeed, or hideous, or frightfully desolate, but, as we may say, austerely plain; a tame, unpleasing aspect, not causing absolute discomfort while one is in it, but left without one lingering reminiscence of anything lovely, awful, or sublime." The rocks are occasionally rendered fertile by the system of terrace cultivation, more common, as almost every traveller since Maundrell has remarked, in former times than now. That keen observer remarks, that if any one were to object that Palestine could not have maintained the vast population stated in Scripture to have inhabited it, he would be confuted by the fact that the most cursory observation shows that "the very rocks were made fruitful," perhaps even to a greater extent than plains could be, "by this method." The "vale," or Shephelah (see note on Joshua 9:1), was a low strip of coast extending from the foot of Carmel to near Gaza. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, or "springs, as it is translated in our version (better, "watercourses," or "slopes," as Knobel),was a fertile country, intersected by ravines and brooks, situated between the mountains and the sea. The word only occurs in the Pentateuch and Joshua (a fact to be noted in forming an opinion on the genuineness of these books). See <a href="../../par/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a> (where it is translated <span class="accented">stream</span> in our version; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>. The root, signifying <span class="accented">pouring forth</span>, is found in Chaldee and Syriac. The LXX. renders this, as well as "the south," strange to say, as a proper name. See note on Joshua 15:19. The Vulgate follows its example in the former case, but not in the latter. The Syriac also renders as a proper name. <span class="cmt_word">Utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the Lord God of Israel commanded.</span> See for the word translated "utterly destroyed," <a href="../../par/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>. These words are a quotation from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16, 17</a>. It seems impossible to evade one of the alternatives, either that Deuteronomy was written before the events recorded in the book of Joshua, or that we have no historical evidence that Joshua <span class="accented">did</span> "utterly destroy all that breathed." The hypothesis that the Divine sanction for such a war of extermination was invented centuries after the Israelites had come to terms with the inhabitants and were daily utterly violating its spirit, and that they then readily allowed themselves to believe it to be of Divine origin, will scarcely bear examination. The attitude of the people toward Gentiles after their captivity is only to be explained by the hypothesis that it was the result of a belief that their misfortunes were due to a law which they had previously received and neglected to obey. Calvin observes how thoroughly these passages bear witness to the fact that the Israelites felt themselves to be the ministers of a Divine purpose in this slaughter. Origen (Hom. 15 on Joshua) says that the Apostles gave order that the Scriptures of the Old Testament were to be read in church, which, he adds, "they would not have done had not these carnal wars prefigured the spiritual warfare which we have to carry on against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.'" <span class="cmt_word">Gaza</span>. Hebrew <span class="accented">Azzah</span> (or <span class="accented">strong</span>), as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>. Joshua's conquests extended to, but did not comprise, Gaza (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2, 3</a>). It was to have been the uttermost limit of the Israelitish <span class="accented">territory</span> (<span class="accented">see Genesis</span> 10:19). It actually was so in the days of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>). But until then the Israelites had not been able to subdue it, though (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-45.htm">Joshua 15:45-47</a>) the whole land of the Philistines was assigned to Judah. What results this failure produced upon the after history of Israel we read in the Books of Judges and Samuel. Not till the reign of David was the Philistine power entirely broken. And Gaza played a very important part in the Philistine confederation. See <a href="../../par/judges/16-1.htm">Judges 16:1-4, 21 -23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-16.htm">1 Samuel 6:16, 17</a>. Gaza has retained its importance even to the present day. Its situation near the sea, and, still more, its position upon the high road from Palestine to Egypt, and from the Mediterranean to Arabia Petraea, have secured it this permanence. When Robinson visited it its population was between fifteen and sixteen thousand - larger even than that of Jerusalem.

Other historians are content to note the secondary causes. The Scriptures trace all to their original source - the will of God. And it is His will, as the page of history shows, with exceptions that do but prove the rule, that a just cause, assisted by bravery., purity, and devotion combined, will not fail, in the long run, to overcome force and fraud. Wars of independence, wars undertaken to chastise wickedness and oppression, seldom fail in their object. And when they do fail, it is generally from the presence of similar crimes among those who undertake the righteous cause, and sully it by their own vices and crimes. History furnishes us with abundant instances of this. The leaders of the struggle for the Protestant Reformation in Europe were often almost as crafty, as ambitious, as self seeking, as immoral, as those against whom they contended. Struggles patriotic in their origin have been marred by the selfish aims of those who carried them on. Selfishness inspires distrust, and distrust produces disunion. But where "the Lord God fights for Israel," where noble objects are pursued by worthy means, there is a moral strength which triumphs over the greatest obstacles. Such an instance we have in modern history in the career of a man like William the Silent. Nearly ruined by the cowardice, obstinacy, and selfishness of his associates, his faith, courage, and perseverance carried a struggle hopeless at the outset to a triumphant conclusion. Men may cry that "Providence is on the side of the big battalions," but "the Lord's hand is not waxen short."

The division of the country into a host of petty states, and the consequent want of cohesion and concert, made its conquest a comparatively easy task. Had the kings of the north rallied round the standard set up in Central Palestine by Adoni-zedek, a far more formidable opposition would have been offered to Joshua at Gibeon. Calvin takes us, however, at once to the fountain head, and remarks how God fitted the burden to those who had to bear it. In spite of the great things God had done to them, they might have been driven to despair (and every one knows how weak their faith was) by the overwhelming numbers of the enemy. But by reason of the slackness of their opponents they were able to meet and overcome them in detail, without any opposition but what their weak faith enabled them courageously to confront. <span class="cmt_word">Jabin king of Hazer.</span> Jabin (the Hebrew meaning of this word is <span class="accented">intelligent</span>) was, like Pharaoh in Egypt, the usual name for the king that reigned in Hazor (see <a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 23, 24</a>). He was a powerful monarch, and if not before, at least after, the Israelitish invasion became the acknowledged head of the league formed among the Canaanites against the Israelites. The first mention we have of Hazor in history is before the Exodus. The temple at Karnak, in Egypt, contains an account of an expedition into Palestine by Thotmes III., in which Kedeshu, Magedi, Damesku, Khatzor or Hazara, and other places are mentioned. We may no doubt identify these with Kedesh-Naphtali, Megiddo, Damascus, and Hazor (see Palest. Expl. Quart. Paper, April, 1876). Hazor, like <span class="accented">fort</span> in French and German, <span class="accented">caer</span> in Welsh, and the termination <span class="accented">cester</span> in English (so also <span class="accented">chester</span>), signifies a castle or fortified town. Like the names above mentioned, it was by no means an uncommon name. Beside the present Hazer, which was in northern Palestine, two cities of that name are mentioned in the south (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-23.htm">Joshua 15:23, 25</a>). It rose from its ashes during the period of inaction which followed the death of Joshua, and though (ch. 19:36) it was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali, became once more the centre of a strong Canaanitish organisation. It was, perhaps, the city Solomon is stated to have fortified (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), though this is not expressly stated. This becomes more probable when we find this Hazer among the cities of northern Israel captured by Tiglath-Pileser (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). "Yet still, in spite of the destruction by the Assyrians, the name lived on till the time of the Maccabees, and the great contest between King Demetrius and Jonathan the Maccabean took place upon the plain of Hazer" (Ritter, 2:225). Josephus also mentions the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> in this connection. Robinson identifies it with Tel Khuraibeh, on the lake of Huleh, the ancient Merom. Conder regards it as represented by Jebel and Merj Hadireh, on the borders of this lake. Dean Stanley places it above the lake, while Vandevelde finds a place called Hazur, with extensive ruins, some distance westward. The names, however, Hazur and Haziri, are very common. Of Madon and Shimron nothing is known. Knobel would identify Achshaph with Aeco or Ptolemais. Robinson supposes it to be the modern Kesai. But this is not certain, for Aehshaph (ch. 19:25) formed the border of Asher, while Kesaf is in the extreme north. According to Conder, it is the present el Yasif.

The word Arabah is given untranslated in <a href="../../par/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18</a>. This was, no doubt, the great Ghor, or depression of the Jordan, or at least the northern part of it, extending for some distance south of the town of Chinneroth (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>). This town gave its name to the lake or inland sea now better known to the student of Scriptures as the sea of Tiberias, or lake of Gennesareth (see <a href="../../par/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>). "As we enter upon the geological character of the basin which contains the sea of Galilee, we see at once that it is simply one element of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea, which extends due north and south for a distance of sixty hours. This is the Ghor, or Sunken Valley of the Arabah" (see note on Joshua 3:16)," extending from Hasbeya to the AElanitic gulf as a continuous cleft - the deepest one known to us" (Ritter, 2:241). He goes on to enumerate the various signs of volcanic agency in this region; the frequent earthquakes, the form of the basin of Gennesareth (though he denies it to be a crater), the hot springs, the frequent eaves, the naphtha deposits and springs, the hot water springs to be found even in the Dead Sea, the lofty crystalline masses of the Sinaitic peninsula, and the porphyritic dykes found at the southern end Of the Ghor, as well as the general conformation of the country east of Jordan. The sea of Chinneroth, or Tiberias, is stated by Conder (Handbook, pp. 212, 216) to be 682.5 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. And in the valley. The Shephelah, or lowland district (see above <a href="../../par/joshua/9-1.htm">Joshua 9:1</a>). The borders of Dot.

This elevated position was a remarkable feature of the neighbourhood, though the various translations of the word (as "coast," <a href="../../par/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>; "region," <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) rather obscure the prominence given to this physical characteristic in the Scripture narrative. Rosenmuller would translate it the "promontory" of Dor, for Dot (now <span class="accented">Tantura, Tortura</span>, or <span class="accented">Dandora</span>) was upon the sea coast south of Carmel, and nine Roman miles north of Caesarea. Thus situated, its position on a hill, though the hill is not a lofty one, would strike the observer, and it accounts for the peculiar form of speech noticed above, which is so common that in the LXX. it is usually given as part of the proper name, <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, ch. 12:23; <span class="greek">&#x39d;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;</span>, <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>). And behind it are still higher rocky ridges, to which the name also applies. Dor, with its excellent harbour, was a noted place of commerce in ancient times, especially in the <span class="accented">murex coccineus</span>, from which the far famed Tyrian dye was obtained. These are a species of mussel, and Seetzen mentions two varieties, the <span class="accented">murex trunculus</span> of Linnaeus, and the <span class="accented">Helix ianthina.</span> The latter is of a whitish green, but when taken out of the water it passes from red to purple, and after death to violet. Its use has been superseded by that of the cochineal insect, but the Tyrian purple was in great demand in early times. Its costliness may be inferred from the fact that in each insect a little pouch behind the head, not the size of a pea, contains the dye. See Ritter, 4:280, 281; Pliny, ' Nat. Hist.' 9, 36 (60 in some editions); and' Epist.' 50, 10, 26. The allusions to it by Horace, Virgil, Juvenal, and other classical authors are too numerous for quotation. We may take as instances Virgil, Georg. 3:17: "Illi victor ego, et Tyrio conspectus in ostro" (cf. AEn. 4:262): and Juvenal, Sat. 7:134; "Spondet enim Tyrio stlataria purpura filo." The ruins of the ancient city still crown the steeps of its site (see Vandevelde's Memoir, and Conder's Handbook. Also Keil <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">.<span class="cmt_word"></span> On the west</span>. The LXX. renders, "And to the Amorites on the sea coast" (see last note), leaving out all mention of the Canaanites. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And to</i> the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and <i>to</i> the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and <i>to</i> the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the Canaanite</span> (see note on Joshua 3:10). This confederacy was yet more formidable than the other (ver. 5), but was as signally defeated by Joshua's promptitude (see ver. 7). We are reminded of the swift march of our own Harold, and its results at Stamford Bridge; with this difference, however, that the enemy, instead of being engaged in triumphant festivity, was preparing for an expedition against a much dreaded enemy, who was believed to be far off. Napoleon had nearly achieved a similar surprise at Quatre Bras and Ligny. <span class="cmt_word">The Jebusite in the mountains.</span> Jerusalem was not yet taken. From the neighbourhood of that as yet unconquered city, and probably from itself, Jabin drew his auxiliaries, while Joshua was as yet fully occupied in the south. Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. Mizpeh, or Ham-mizpah, as it is usually called (save in ver. 8; <a href="../../par/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the watch-tower, was a common name among the Israelites. There was one in Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-38.htm">Joshua 15:38</a>), in Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-26.htm">Joshua 18:26</a>), in Gilead (<a href="../../par/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/31-49.htm">Genesis 31:49</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>), and in Moab (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3</a>). Ritter (ii. 353) mentions the large number of watch towers, of which the ruins may still he traced, along the line of the great watershed of Judea. This one was probably far to the north, on the northwestern side of Hermon, commading a view of the plain of Coele Syria, which extended from southwest to northeast between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon. This vast plain is still known as the Bukei'a (see note on Joshua 5:8), though Robinson denies that this Bukei'a is meant, because the Bukei'a properly so called was not under Hermon. This makes it possible that Mizpeh might have been on the south. eastern side of Hermon, where also an extensive view might be had. Ritter, however, says it can be no other than "the great plain which extends north of Lake Huleh, from its narrow western margin to Banias, that is, the plain south and <span class="accented">southwest</span> of Hermon. Some have supposed the meaning of Mizpeh to be equivalent to Belle Vue in modern days. But the meaning "watchtower" suggests ideas more in keeping with those rude times, in which our modern appreciation of scenery was a rare quality. It was not the beauty of the view which was valued, but its extent, as giving timely notice of the approach of an enemy. Mount Hermon has already been mentioned in the note on Joshua 1:4. Some further particulars may here be added. We find in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a> that the Amorites call the mountain Shenir, and the Sidonians Sirion. It is very remarkable, and bears on the authorship of the Song of Solomon, that the Amorite name Shenir is given to Hermon in <a href="../../par/songs/4-8.htm">Song of Solomon 4:8</a>. Was the song addressed to a Hittite wife, or had Solomon an Amorite one? In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a> Hermon is called Sion. With the former of these passages we may compare <a href="../../par/psalms/29-6.htm">Psalm 29:6</a>. But we must not confound (as even a writer so well informed as Bitter does) the Zion, or Tzion (sunny mount), of <a href="../../par/psalms/133.htm">Psalm 133</a>, where Hermon is mentioned, with the Sion, or "lofty mountain" (spelt with <span class="accented">Sin</span>, not <span class="accented">Tzade</span>), in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-48.htm">Deuteronomy 4:48</a>. Vandevelde asks why the mountain is called by so many names, and replies that it is because "it is a cluster of mountains many days' journey in circumference." A much better reason is suggested by the fact mentioned in our former note - that, as the highest ground in Palestine, it was visible from every part of it. The name Sirion, or the <span class="accented">coat of mail</span>, was no doubt given from its glittering, surface. It is to be feared that the reason given above for the Sidonian name diminishes the probability of the remarkable argument in Blunt's 'Coincidences,' part 2:2, derived from the Sidonian settlement (<a href="../../par/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>.) at the foot of Hermon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that <i>is</i> upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span>  <span class="cmt_word">And they went out.</span> Dean Stanley (Lectures, 1:259) compares this "last struggle" of the Canaanites with the conflict between the Saxons and the British chiefs "driven to the Land's End." The comparison is more picturesque than accurate. In the first place, it was by no means a "last struggle" (see ver. 21; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-3.htm">Joshua 18:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>. throughout). In the next, the Britons were never driven to the Land's End, but Dorsetshire, which retained its independence for 200 years, was treated by Ina as Gezer (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a>), was treated by the Ephraimites, while Devonshire and Cornwall came very gradually and almost peacefully under the hands of the conquerors. And thirdly, even had it been otherwise, there is a vast difference between a handful of desperate men driven to bay on a tongue of land surrounded nearly on every side by the sea, and a powerful, though defeated, nation with a vast continent in its rear. Yet there are many features common to the history of the Israelites in Canaan, and of the Teutonic tribes in Britain (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">As the sand that is upon the sea shore.</span> This poetic phrase is common in the Hebrew writings (see <a href="../../par/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/32-12.htm">Genesis 32:12</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>, etc.). Solomon's capacious intellect is compared to the sand on the sea shore, in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-29.htm">1 Kings 4:29</a>. The word translated "shore" is  "lip" in the original, a word which adds to the poetry of the passage. <span class="cmt_word">And horses and chariots very many.</span> Literally, many ex<span class="accented">ceedingly.</span> The Israelites appear to have held cavalry and chariots in great awe (see <a href="../../par/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>, and the song of triumph in <a href="../../par/exodus/15.htm">Exodus 15</a>; cf. also <a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>). In later times they appear to have become more used to them. See, for instance, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>, where the historian gives their number, large as it was, instead of regarding it as past all computation. This battle must have taken place on level ground, or the chariots would have been useless. Accordingly the historian fixes its scene on the banks of "the waters of Merom," where such ground is to be found - another instance of his historical accuracy (see Vandevelde, Journey 2:413, who places the battle on the great plain southwest of the latter). The use of chariots in battle dates from an early period. Homer's heroes are described as driven to battle in them. But perhaps the scythe chariots are here meant, which are not found on early Egyptian monuments, but which Xenophon in his Cyropaedia says were introduced By Cyrus. We find them, however, in use in Britain, in the days of Julius Caesar, and they could hardly have obtained the idea from the Persians. Potter (Antiquities, bk. 3. ch. 1.) says that they were gradually abandoned when they were found more dangerous to those who used them than to the enemy. That this kind of chariot is here meant seems pretty certain from the alarm they caused. No such alarm would have been caused by chariots simply used to convey the chieftains to the fight (see Gesenius, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Xenophon, Cyr. 6:4; and 2 Macc. 13:2). <span class="cmt_word">All their hosts</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-5.htm">Joshua 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The waters of Merom.</span> Robinson and the later travellers generally identify this with the Samochonitis (Joseph, Ant. 5:01; Bell. Jud. 3.9.7; 4.1.1), now Huleh. Keil and Delitzseh deny this, but it may be regarded as established, on the authority of Ritter, Vandevelde, Tristram, in short of all who have visited Palestine during the last thirty years. But its name, "the waters of height," would seem to answer to this, the highest of the inland lakes of Palestine. The Jordan runs through it, and it is also the reservoir for numerous other streams. "In the centre of this plain, half morass, half tarn, lies the uppermost lake of the Jordan" - the little lake Phiala excepted - "about seven miles long, and at its greatest width six miles broad, the mountains slightly compressing it at either extremity, surrounded by an almost impenetrable jungle of reeds, abounding in wild fowl, the sloping hills near it scoured by herds of gazelles" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 382). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-6.htm">Joshua 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord said unto Joshua</span>. The encouragement was not unnecessary. The task before Joshua was harder than any that had yet befallen him. The enemy was far more numerous and better equipped. And it is a well known fact that men of tried courage are often daunted by unaccustomed dangers. Therefore all Joshua's strength of mind was required to inspirit even men who had experienced God's wonderful support at the passing of the Jordan, at the siege of Jericho, at the battle before Gibeon, now that they were face to face with the unwonted spectacle of a vast host, furnished with all the best munitions of war known to that age. The Israelites had nothing to depend upon but their own tried valour, and the reliance they felt upon God's support. "Unequal in arms and tactics," says Ewald ('Hist. Israel.,' 2:2. C.), "they could oppose to the Canaanites only courage and confidence." <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow about this time.</span> The promise was made on the eve of the encounter, but not, of course, as some have supposed, while Joshua was still at Gilgal. We are not told how long Joshua was on the march. Probably (as in ch. 2.) he had sent scouts forward, who brought him intelligence on the day before the battle of the vastness of the host, and the formidable nature of its equipment. The martial spirit Joshua had infused into the host, and the spirit of faith in God begotten of His recent acts of favour, contrast remarkably with the conduct of the Israelites described in <a href="../../par/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. To each servant of God His own special gift is vouchsafed. Moses was the man to inspire the Israelites with a reverence for law. Joshua had the special aptitudes for the leader in a campaign. It is a confirmation of this view that, in the one successful engagement recorded during the forty years' wandering in the desert, Joshua, not Moses, was the leader of the troops, while the aged law giver remained at a distance, encouraging them by his prayers (see <a href="../../par/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>). But while we thus regard the secondary influences of individual character, we must not forget that the Israelites were also sustained at this moment by the assurances of Divine protection given at Jericho, at Ai, at Beth-horon, which had not been vouchsafed to them while under Moses's leadership in the wilderness. <span class="cmt_word">Will I deliver up.</span> The "I" in the original is emphatic. And the use of the present participle in the Hebrew adds vividness to the promise. <span class="cmt_word">Slain</span>. LXX. and Vulg., <span class="accented">wounded.. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou shalt hough their horses.</span> To hough (or <span class="accented">hoxe</span>, Wiclif) is to <span class="accented">hamstring</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX., to cut the sinews behind the hoofs, the <span class="accented">hocks</span>, as they are called. This rendered the horse useless, for the sinew could not reunite. The effects of the horses and chariots upon the mind of Joshua and his host, who had neither, is here traceable. "Those very horses and chariots, which seem to you so formidable, will I, the Lord of hosts, be tomorrow at this time delivering into your hand. The horses shall be forever useless to your enemies, and the dreaded chariots shall cease to be." Why should Joshua have destroyed the horses? Perhaps (as Keil, following Calvin, suggests) in order that the Israelites should not put their trust in chariots or in horses (<a href="../../par/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>), but in God alone (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). But more obvious considerations of policy may have dictated the measure. God never (see <a href="../../par/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1-7</a>) makes use of supernatural means when natural ones are sufficient. Now the Israelites were unacquainted with the use of horses in warfare, while their enemies were not. To retain the horses while the country was as yet unsubdued would have been a double burden to them, for they would have had not <span class="accented">only</span> to keep them themselves, but to prevent the enemy from regaining them. On the same principle in modern warfare do we spike guns we cannot carry off, and destroy provisions we cannot convert to our own use.

The issue of every battle is in God's hands. The natural man attributes it to human skill. The spiritual man, whether under the law or under the gospel, acknowledges the truth that "there is no restraint to the Lord, to save by many or by few" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>). But if victory should ever side with numbers, if God appears not to "defend the right," it is that anxiety and sorrow may chasten the hearts of its upholders, lead them to "crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts," and so conduct them to a final victory when they are fitted to resist the intoxication of prosperity. Many a lesson in history has taught us that immediate success is by no means a blessing, even to those who are in the main fighting for a good cause. <span class="cmt_word">Great Zidon.</span> So called, not to distinguish it from any other city, but to mark (so also <a href="../../par/joshua/19-28.htm">Joshua 19:28</a>) its importance as the capital of Phoenicia. This expression, "great Zidon," marks the early date of the Book of Joshua. In Homer's Iliad, Sidon is represented as the great home of the arts, though the historian Justin tells us that, even when Homer wrote, her superiority had passed to Tyre (see II. 6:290, 23. 743; Odyssey 4:618, 13:285, 15:425. Homer speaks of it as "well peopled," famous for "much brass" and the like (see Kenrick's 'Phoenicia'). In later years, Tyre, known only to the Book of Joshua as "the strong (literally, 'fortified') city." Tyre (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a>) outstripped her rival, and from the time of David till that of Alexander the Great, in spite of her destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, retained her pre-eminence (see the vivid description of Tyre in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26, 27</a>.). Sidon, now called Saida, is still a commercial city of some importance, whereas Tyre is, or was, a few years ago, little better than a collection of huts. This is not difficult to explain. The pre-eminence of Tyre was due to her military strength in a time of warlike enterprise, that of Sidon to natural, position. "This ancient city of Phoenicia, 'the eldest born of Canaan'" (see <a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), "stood on the northwest slope of a small promontory which runs into the sea, and its original harbour was formed by three low ridges of rocks, with narrow openings between them parallel to the shore in front of the city. On these islands there are remains of massive substructions, the work of the ancient Phoenicians. There is a spacious but unprotected bay on the south of the promontory .... No traces of the ancient city can be seen on the mainland, but at a short distance to the north are sepulchral grottoes, which probably mark the necropolis." The plain of Sidon is prolonged as far as Sarepta, the Zarephath of the Old Testament, eight miles to the south, which stands on a rising ground near the sea, and shows the remains of ancient walls (Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' pp. 17, 18). <span class="cmt_word">Misrephoth Maim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">burnings of waters. Kimchi</span> conjectures that these were hot springs, whereas <span class="accented">Jarchi</span> more reasonably supposes them to have been salt pits, in which the water was evaporated and the salt left. <span class="accented">Masius</span>, whom most modern commentators follow, thinks that glass houses, of which there were several near Sidon ("constat enim eas apud Sidonem fuisse plurimas"), are meant. But it is difficult to translate the Hebrew with him and Gesenins, "burning <span class="accented">near</span> waters," and the idea of some that water stands here for glass is absurd. Knobel regards it as equivalent to water-heights, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, cliffs rising from the sea, and derives the word from an Arabic root, <span class="accented">saraph, to be</span> high. The LXX. renders it by a proper name.

Hazor was afterwards rebuilt and reoccupied by the Canaanites (<a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2</a>), though not in the time of Joshua. For the present, this destruction of the stronghold of Phoenician power in the north was a decisive measure, and would have been so permanently had the Israelites followed up the policy of Joshua.

Rather, <span class="accented">on their hill</span> ("in collibus et in tumulis sitae," Vulg.). As many of the towns in Italy, and the castles in Germany in the middle ages, so these Phoenician cities were placed upon hills, that they might be more easily defended. The various tribes of Palestine were no doubt continually at war, and, as regards these northern tribes at least, were not accustomed to subsist by commerce. Therefore each of these cities stood (the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span> surely implies <span class="accented">situation</span> here) on its own hill, a detail possibly obtained from an eyewitness, who was probably struck by this feature of the district, a feature he had not observed before. The expression is used, however, as Masius observes, by Jeremiah (Joshua 30:18). Knobel observes that all the early versions have no suffix here. What he calls the "free translation," however, of the LXX. (which has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) requires the suffix, though the Vulgate requires none. We must not adopt the very plausible explanation of Knobel and others that Joshua burnt the cities in the valleys, but spared the cities on the hills, because they could be more easily defended (see <a href="../../par/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19, 34</a>), since we read that Hazor alone was burnt.

Only one instance in which he erred, that of the league with Gibeon, is recorded, and this was but an illlustration of the unsuspicious straightforwardness of his character (see notes on Joshua 19:49-51; 23:2; 24:15).

The same word is translated "mountain" immediately afterwards, to the confusion of the sense, which contrasts the mountains of Israel with the mountains of Judah (see ver. 21). This would seem at first sight to lead to the conclusion that the Book of Joshua was composed after the jealousy between Judah and the rest of Israel had sprung up in the time of David (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41</a>-48). But Dr. Edersheim has suggested another explanation. Judah, he says (see <a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), entered upon their inheritance, while the other tribes were still in Gilgal. In the same way Mount Ephraim is so called because it was given to that tribe, and occupied by them shortly after. While as the remaining seven tribes remained without their inheritance (Reuben and Gad as well as Manasseh and Ephraim being now provided for), the rest of the mountains were known as the mountains of Israel. This explanation is ingenious, but hardly satisfactory. Ephraim (see <a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1, 2</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-1.htm">Judges 12:1</a>) early acquired a preponderance over the other tribes. We should therefore expect a threefold division of the mountain district, the mountains of Judah, of Joseph, and of Israel, especially as Ephraim was the next after Judah to enter upon its inheritance. The internal evidence seems to prove that the Book of Joshua was written by one of the tribe of Judah, or by a Levite residing within the borders of that tribe. Perhaps this affords the best explanation, but is quite possible that the whole mountain district of Palestine is here meant. <span class="cmt_word">The south.</span> The Negeb, or dry country (see <a href="../../par/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The valley.</span> The <span class="accented">Shephelah</span>, or lowlands (see note on Joshua 9:1).

This may either be interpreted "the mountain bare of foliage," as opposed to Seir, the hairy or wooded mountain, as Masius and Rosenmuller suppose, or, as the latter also suggests, it may mean the mountain which has a smooth outline, as opposed to a precipitous cliff. This falls in with the character of the hills on the south of Palestine (see note on Joshua 10:40). The LXX. renders by a proper name. But this the article forbids. The Syriac interpreter renders "the <span class="accented">dividing</span> mountain."

This mountainous region was well known as the territory of Esau (see <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon.

Baal-gad has been by some identified with Baalbek, or Heliopolis, a Syrian city, whose vast ruins strike the beholder with astonishment even now. But Baalbek lay considerably to the north of Palestine. It has therefore with greater probability been identified by Robinson, Von Raumer, and others, with Paneas or Caesarea Philippi. Baal-gad signifies "the lord of fortune," an aspect under which the Babylonian Baal or Bel was frequently worshipped. The word Gad, erroneously translated "troop" in our version (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-11.htm">Genesis 30:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-11.htm">Isaiah 65:11</a>), is properly "fortune," and hence the god Fortune. The worship of Pan in later times supplanted that of Baal, but traces of both cults, in inscriptions and niches, may be found in the neighbourhood to the present day (see Tristram, 'Land of Israel'). All travellers speak with enthusiasm of the situation of Banias. Josephus says that it affords a profusion of natural gifts. Seetzen corroborates him. Dean Stanley compares it to Tivoli, and Canon Tristram thinks that in its rocks, caverns, and cascades there is much to remind the visitor of what is perhaps the loveliest place in all Italy. He continues, "The situation of Banias is indeed magnificent. With tall limestone cliffs to the north and east, a rugged torrent of basalt to the south, and a gentle slope for its western front, Banias is almost hidden till the traveller is among the ruins." Banias stands at the end of a gorge of the Hermon range with the wide range of the Huleh plain opening out before it, as the Campagna and Rome in the distance are seen from the mouth of the gorge at Tivoli. Vandevelds, however, identifies Banias with Beth-rehob, on the insufficient ground that Baal-gad is said to be in, not at, the mouth of the valley or Bik'ath of Lebanon. He prefers the castles either of Bostra or of Aisafa, the one an hour and a half, the other three hours north of Banias. It should be added that an arm of the Jordan rises and rushes through the gorge here, "praeceps," like the Anio at Tivoli. The valley of Lebanon is supposed by some not to be the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, but the country on the southern declivity of Mount Hermon. But the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> here unquestionably means the well-known Bukei'a or Coele Syria, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the tract between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon (see Knobel).

Muller, 'Christian Doctrine of Sin,' 2:412, says that "Scripture never speaks of God's hardening men's hearts, save in connection with His revelations through Moses or Christ." This passage evidently had not occurred to him when writing. His explanation of the difficulty is hardly satisfactory. We are not to suppose that the free will of the Canaanites was in any way interfered with. God no doubt left them to themselves as the due punishment of their iniquities. Sin in general, by God's own appointment, and especially the sensual sins in which the Canaanites were steeped, has a tendency to produce insensibility to moral or even prudential considerations, and to beget a recklessness which urges on the sinner to his ruin. Some have argued that had they all come, like the Gibeonites, as suppliants, they must all have been massacred in cold blood. But this is not likely. Rather we must imagine that God foresaw that they would not believe the signs He would give in favour of the Israelites, and that by meeting them in battle they brought a swift and speedy destruction on themselves.

It is worthy of remark that to the two fearless men whose faith did not fail them at the sight of the walled cities, and of the giant forms of their inhabitants, was entrusted the task of overcoming these antagonists, and thus of proving the truth of their own words. Thus it ever is in the counsels of God. "To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away." To Joshua, who had confidence in God, the whole land of Canaan was given into subjection. From the Israelites, who had not that confidence, the inheritance of their fathers was taken away (cf. also <a href="../../par/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21, 28</a>). Many writers suppose that these Anakim (like the Rephaim of <a href="../../par/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>) were the aboriginal inhabitants, and of Turanian descent (see note on next verse). <span class="cmt_word">Anab</span>. A town about ten miles southwest of Hebron (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-50.htm">Joshua 15:50</a>). It was apparently one of the daughter cities of Debir, and there is still a place of that name in the immediate vicinity of Dhaharijeh. <span class="cmt_word">Mountains of Judah.</span> For this and the "mountains of Israel" see note on ver. 16. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-22.htm">Joshua 11:22</a></div><div class="verse">There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only in Gaza.</span> This statement is confirmed by what we afterwards read.

But it had almost died out. Goliath and his brethren seem to have been regarded by the Philistines, as much as by the Hebrews, in the light of prodigies. It may be that the race deteriorated in size and strength, when driven from the mountain district. Gaza (Hebrew Azzah, as in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-20.htm">Jeremiah 25:20</a>) was a stronghold of the Philistines. We first find it mentioned as the border of Canaan in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>. It was the scene of the exploits of Samson, related in <a href="../../par/judges/16.htm">Judges 16</a>. It, with Gath, Ekron, Ashdod, and Ashkelon, formed the five Philistine lordships mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>. Gaza does not appear in the list of cities captured by David, although Gath does. Perhaps the strength of its position (Azzah signifies strength) may have enabled it to resist David and Solomon, whose dominions are said to have extended to, but not to have included, Azzah. We read little more of it in the Old Testament. Jeremiah says that Pharaoh smote it (Joshua 47:1); Amos and Zephaniah threatened it with punishment. It is mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a> as a place of some importance. And it still exists, at about an hour's journey from the sea, and is now called Ghazzeh. (see also note on ver. 41). Gath. Also one of the five Philistine lordships. In David's time it had a king, with whom David took refuge (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). It was afterwards conquered by David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-20.htm">2 Samuel 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-6.htm">1 Chronicles 20:6</a>). We find it in Solomon's jurisdiction, though under the government of one of its own royal family (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>). Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>). Hazael, the powerful king of Syria, wrested it from Jehoash, and was only bought air from assailing Jerusalem. Uzziah retook it once more (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). Hezekiah seems to have retained it (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>). After this we hear no more of it. Modern travellers and commentators have identified it with Beit-Jibrin (the house of the mighty - perhaps a reminiscence of Goliath and his kindred), now Eleutheropolis (so Knobel). Others suppose it to be the Blanche Garde of the Crusaders, or Tell-es-Safieh, an opinion supported, among others, by Mr. J. L. Porter and Lieut. Conder. See, however, the note on Libnah, <a href="../../par/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29</a>. Ashdod. Later Azotus, now Esdud. Here the ark was carried after the disastrous defeat related in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>. It was conquered by Uzziah (no doubt it had formerly been reduced by David), who built forts to overawe it (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), but it fell into the hands of Sargon, king of Assyria, a little later (<a href="../../par/isaiah/20-1.htm">Isaiah 20:1</a>). It is frequently mentioned by the prophets, and we find that Jonathan, the brother of Judas Maceabaeus, burnt the temple of Dagon there (1 Macc. 10:83, 84). It is mentioned as Azotus in <a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a></div><div class="verse">So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joshua took the whole land.</span> The word must not be pressed to mean that every Canaanitish stronghold was razed or appropriated. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, as has been before remarked, has a very loose signification in Hebrew. What is meant is simply this. Joshua had established an unquestioned military preponderance in Palestine. He had broken down all resistance; but before he completed his conquests to their full extent, he had to provide for the peaceable settlement of the tribes in the territory he had seized. The complete extermination of the Canaanites formed no part of his commission or his plan (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-29.htm">Exodus 23:29, 30</a>). To have effected it would have been to throw the land out of cultivation, and to expose its possessors to the usual inconveniences of depopulated districts. Therefore it was Joshua's policy to leave the Canaanites to be extirpated by degrees, and to encourage the Israelites to cultivate the arts both of war and of peace; to nourish a martial spirit by remembering that numerous and active enemies still dwelt in their midst, while yet they were not neglectful of the importance of a settled and civilised, an agricultural and pastoral life. See also <a href="../../par/judges/3-1.htm">Judges 3:1, 2</a>. This purpose was defeated, not only by the usual effects of civilisation upon hardy or savage tribes, but also by the Israelites becoming addicted to the pleasant but enfeebling vices of the races they had supplanted. We see in the Israelitish history the best exemplification of St. Paul's theory that the "law worketh wrath," although it is "holy, just, and good." The excellence of the moral precepts delivered by Moses did but serve to manifest more clearly the inherent depravity of our nature (<a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/5-20.htm">Romans 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/7-7.htm">Romans 7:7, 8</a>), and its need of a Saviour, who should render obedience possible by the gift of regeneration, and the infusion of His own Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">According to their divisions.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">their divisions by lot</span>, the word being derived from the same root as the word Halak in ver. 7, because a smooth stone was usually employed in casting lots. Hence it came to mean any authoritative division or distribution, as the courses of the Levites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-6.htm">1 Chronicles 23:6</a>), the classification for purposes of enlistment (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>) and the like. <span class="cmt_word">And the land rested from war.</span> That is to say, the Canaanites were so thoroughly cowed and dispirited that they dared offer no further resistance to the Israelites in their task of portioning out the land. They were quite contented to be allowed to live in peace in such of their cities which remained, and had no disposition to court an overthrow such as took place at the battles of Gibeon and Merom, with its inevitable results of the absolute extermination, not only of every one who took up arms, but of every human being in the city to which they belonged. Thus the Israelites were able to give their whole attention to the survey and apportionment of the territory according to the relative size and importance of the tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/12.htm"><title>Joshua 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/11.htm" title="Joshua 11">&#9668;</a> Joshua 12 <a href="../joshua/13.htm" title="Joshua 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-1.htm">Joshua 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now these <i>are</i> the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now these are the kings.</span> The historian now enters upon a complete description of the whole territory which had, up to this date, fallen into the hands of the Israelites. First he traces out the border of the trans-Jordanic possessions of Israel, which he describes as bounded on the south by the river Arnon, on the west of course by the Jordan, and as extending from Hermon, past the Sea of Chinneroth, to the borders of the Dead Sea. The eastern border is not clearly defined, but the boundary extended far further eastward in the north than in the south, since the territory of Og was much more extensive than that of Sihon. On the west of Jordan the territory is described as extending "from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Baalbec or Caesarea Philippi; see note on ch. 11:17) unto the Mount Halak which goeth up to Seir, which we have seen to be a range of mountains extending southward from near the south point of the Dead Sea. The border of the Israelitish possessions is more accurately defined in the succeeding chapters, but it was, after all, a slip of territory not more than 180 miles in length by about 100 in breadth. Its influence upon the history of the world, like that of Athens and Sparta, must not be measured by its size, but by its moral energy. As the former city has attained undying fame by its intellectual power, the second by its mihtary capacity, so Palestine has derived her title to fame from her indestructible national life - indestructible because built alone, of all the religious systems of the ancient world, upon the foundations of the unity and Fatherhood of God; indestructible, moreover, because it came by revelation from God. There is no greater argument for the Divine origin of the Mosaic law than the unique spectacle of a national life like that of the Jews, subsisting for nearly two thousand years after their expulsion from their land. <span class="cmt_word">From the river Arnon</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). The word Arnon Signifies <span class="accented">the swift stream</span> (see Gesenius,'Thesaur.' s.v.). It is now called by the Arabs, <span class="accented">El-Mujeb</span>. Seetzen represents the region round its mouth to be naturally most fertile, but as abandoned now to a few wild plants. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Mount Hermon.</span> Now <span class="accented">Jebel-es-Sheikh</span>. We have a vivid description of the scenery of Hermon in <a href="../../par/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42</a>, with the noise of its foaming torrents, the "deep calling unto deep" from the recesses of its dark ravines, where the infant Jordan rushed along its rocky bed. The Psalmist pictures to himself his troubles as overwhelming him like the billows of the numerous streams that streaked the mountain sides. And yet again Hermon is introduced as the image of peace and plenty and brotherly love. The refreshing dews which distilled from the side of the giant mountain were the source of blessing to those who dwelt afar off, and even the dry and parched sides of Mount Zion were cooled by their delicious influence. In <a href="../../par/psalms/42-6.htm">Psalm 42:6</a> the Psalmist speaks of Hermon in the plural. Some have regarded this (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Ritter) as referring to the double peak of the mountain. The phrase most probably refers to the region, though Hermon has really three peaks (see note on Joshua 11:3). <span class="cmt_word">And all the plain on the east.</span> The Arabah (see <a href="../../par/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a>). The depression of the Jordan, which lay eastward, of course, of Palestine. This is much insisted on in the following verses. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-2.htm">Joshua 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, <i>and</i> ruled from Aroer, which <i>is</i> upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, <i>which is</i> the border of the children of Ammon;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - T<span class="cmt_word">he river Jabbok.</span> Literally, the pouring or emptying stream.

This latter word indicates the rocky cleft through which the water flows; the former, the fact that, though rapid and impetuous in winter, it was usually dried up in summer. Cf. the term <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, applied to the Kedron by St. John (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>); a remarkable instance of accuracy, by the way, if, as we are confidently told, the author of that Gospel was an Ephesine Gentile who had never seen Jerusalem and was imperfectly acquainted with Jewish localities and customs. The Jabbok has been identified with the Wady Zerka, or <span class="accented">blue stream</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And from the plain.</span> There is no "from" in the original, which here ceases to describe the territories of Sihon, but continues the account of the Israelite dominions, which included the Arabah (not the <span class="accented">plain</span> as in our version) up to the sea of Chinneroth. <span class="cmt_word">On the east;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the east of Jordan. So also below. <span class="cmt_word">The way to Beth-jeshimoth</span> (see <a href="../../par/numbers/33-48.htm">Numbers 33:48, 49</a>). There was a desert tract near the Dead Sea called Jeshimon, or the waste district. It is described by travellers as the most arid portion of the whole land. In this, Beth-jeshimoth (the house of desolations) was situated. It was south of the acacia meadows (see note on Joshua 2:1), and it formed part of the territory of Reuben (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-20.htm">Joshua 13:20</a>). As it lay upon Jordan, it must have been near the extreme northernmost point of the Dead Sea. We are to understand, not that Sihon's territory extended to Beth-jeshimoth, but in that direction. Possibly some of the western Cauaanitish tribes here extended their territories across the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">And from the south.</span> The word here is not Negeb, but Teman, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the literal south, which lay on the right (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) to one looking eastward. <span class="cmt_word">Ashdoth-pisgah.</span> For Ashdoth see <a href="../../par/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>. Pisgah was the northernmost point of the Abarim range, of which the well known Nebo was the chief peak. Thither Moses went up to view the land which he was not permitted to enter. There Balaam built his seven altars and essayed in vain to curse the children of Israel. There were the watchmen (Zophim) stationed to protect the land, in the days before the Israelitish invasion, from the incursions of the tribes on the other side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-14.htm">Numbers 23:14</a>). The position of Pisgah has not been precisely identified, but the range extended on the eastern side of Jordan to a point nearly opposite Jericho. See <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the coast of Og king of Bashan, <i>which was</i> of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The giants.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; also <a href="../../par/joshua/17-15.htm">Joshua 17:15</a>). The word, according to Ewald, is equivalent to "stretched out." It was also applied to the dead. The Rephaim were one of the various tribes of giants, like the Anakims, Zuzims, and Emims, of whom we read in the land of Canaan. They occupied the land of Bashan and "half Gilead" - that is, its northern portion (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>). The term "remnant" would imply that they had suffered some reverses at the hands of the other tribes, though they still remained in possession of their populous territory in the north. This view is confirmed by <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Ashtaroth</span> (see note on Joshua 9:10). Edrei. Or "the strong city," "the city of the arm," according to Gesen., 'Thes.,' s.v. This name, together with the immense number of ruined cities which have been found of late years in a marvellous state of preservation in this region, shows that Og was a powerful monarch. The ease with which he was overcome bears witness to the enervating effects of luxury and licentiousness upon a people of strong <span class="accented">physique</span>, vast numbers, and high civilisation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-5.htm">Joshua 12:5</a></div><div class="verse">And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Geshurites.</span> See <a href="../../par/joshua/13-2.htm">Joshua 13:2, 11, 13</a>; and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>; also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-37.htm">2 Samuel 13:37</a>, where we find the principality of Geshur still in possession of its independence. It was in the northeast corner of Bashan, abutting upon Syria, and is called "Geshur in Syria" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>). It is perhaps an instance of undesigned coincidence that Maachah, the mother of Absalom and the daughter of the king of Geshur, was so named, since she probably derived her name from the adjoining territory of Maachah (see note on Joshua 13:2). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-6.htm">Joshua 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it <i>for</i> a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave.</span> Theodoret makes the tribes which received their inheritance through Moses the types of the believing Jews, and those who received it through Jesus (Joshua) the types of the believing Gentiles. Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were the first born of their respective mothers, and were thus types of the Jews, who were God's firstborn. As they passed over armed before their brethren, so we received the good tidings of salvation from the lips of Jews. This is a characteristic specimen of the allegorical interpretation of the early fathers. But it will be observed that the children of Bilhah, who might have been selected more naturally than those of Zilpah, are entirely omitted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And these <i>are</i> the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel <i>for</i> a possession according to their divisions;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And these are the kings of the country.</span> We now proceed to the enumeration of the kings whom Joshua had overcome on the western side of Jordan. And the first thing that strikes us is their immense number, as compared to the two potentates who alone occupied the large tract of country subdued on the other side of Jordan. Such a divided territory could hardly have maintained itself in the face of the powerful monarchs Sihon and Og to the eastward of Jordan. We are thus led to the conclusion that the smaller kings must have been tributary to some more powerful monarch who was the head of the confederacy. Such <span class="accented">Bretwaldas</span>, to borrow a term from our own history, the kings of Jerusalem and Hazor appear to have been, the one the head of the northern, the other of the southern tribes of Palestine, while possibly the five Philistine cities may have constituted another league, as they appear to have successfully defied the power of the Israelites from the first. That such confederacies existed at a much earlier time, we find from <a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1-5</a>, where the king of Elam, or Persia, appears as the head of such an one, though of a more extensive character. The resistance to his power organised by the kings in the neighbourhood of the Dead Sea is another case in point. Possibly in later times Persia and Babylon found their hands full in their conflict with one another, and with Egypt under Thothmes III., as afterwards under the all-conquering Rameses II., better known as Sesostris, and they had to leave the tribes of Palestine awhile to themselves. Or the rulers of the central power at Carchemish (see Introduction) may have exercised a kind of suzerainty over all. The next point to be observed is that, in the list of kings that follows, a good many are mentioned beside those enumerated in ch. 10. No doubt, as in the earlier history of this island, there were not only heads of leagues, and their tributary monarchs, but under kings also, who were actually subject to the reigning monarchs, and involved in their fall.

If so, it is the Gedor of the Onomasticon, ten miles from Beit-Jibrin, or Eleutheropolis, now Jedireh. Conder, however, with whom Vandevelde seems to agree, places Geder in the mountain region, and identifies it with Gedor (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>) and the modern Jedur, in the Hebron mountain. So Keil and Delitzsch, Robinson, and others. The Gedor in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39</a> may be the same place. It is described as on the east side of the "gai," or ravine, but no clearer indication of the place is given. It is, however, unlikely that the Simeonites would have found the children of tiara undisturbed in the mountains of Hebron in the reign of Hezekiah (see vers. 40, 41). The LXX. reads Gerar, and this is very probably the true reading. There was a "Nahal," or winter torrent, there (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-17.htm">Genesis 26:17, 19</a>), and therefore possibly a "gal." The whole passage in 1 Chronicles should be consulted. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a></div><div class="verse">The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hormah, Arad.</span> Cities in the Negeb, near the border of Edom (see <a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/33-40.htm">Numbers 33:40</a>). Hor-mah was originally known as Zephath (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16, 17</a>, where the fullest description of the locality is given). It was in the wilderness of Judaea, in the arid country (Negeb) of Arad. Mr. Palmer identifies it with Sebaita, in the centre of the Negeb, in the Magrah-el-Esbaita, a mountain valley sloping down into the Wady-el-Abyadh. Other explorers prefer Sulifat, and Rowlands and G. Williams, Sepata. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a></div><div class="verse">The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Adullam</span>. In the Shephelah (<span class="accented">valley</span> in our version. See ch. 15:33-35). Canon Tristram in his 'Bible Lands,' as well as Conder in his 'Handbook,' identify this with Aid-el-Me, or Mich. In the Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund for July, 1875 (see also Jan., 1874), Lieut. Conder details a visit to this place, previously identified by M. Clermont-Ganneau. These explorers reject the idea approved by Vandevelde and others, that this Deir Dabban is the ancient Adullam. The place he prefers fulfils all requirements. It is in the Shephelah. It is near Jarmuth and Socoh. It is an ancient site with "rock cut tombs, good water supply, and main road, and communications from different sides, and it is moreover a strong military position. It contains no remarkable cave, but a number of small ones, now used as habitations by the peasantry." Keilah, which David saved from the Philistines (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-5</a>), was within a reasonable distance. The present name, Aid-el-Me or Mieh, the feast of the hundred, may be a misapprehension of the word Adullam similar to that which converts the Welsh "yr eifel," in Carnarvonshire, into the English "the rivals," or which identifies in many English names the English <span class="accented">burn</span> (brook) with the French <span class="accented">borne</span> (boundary). One of the greatest objections to the theory is that the Hebrew so frequently speaks of the place as Cave-Adullam (Ma'arah-Adullam), as though some special cave existed there. Adullam plays a somewhat important part in Scripture history. We hear of it as early as <a href="../../par/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>, where Hirah the Adullamite is spoken of as a friend of the patriarch Judah.. It is well known as the refuge of David and his mighty men (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13-17</a>). It was the place where David composed two of his psalms, the 57th and the 142nd. Rehoboam fortified it (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). It seems to be regarded as a refuge in <a href="../../par/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. And it is mentioned among the cities re-occupied after the return from the captivity in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>.

It is difficult say whether this was Tappuah in Judah (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>; cf. ver. 53), or in Manasseh (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7, 8</a>). The mention of Aphekah in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>, and of Aphek here, would suggest the former, or the mention of Socoh in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a> (see below on Hepher). But the mention of Lasharon, the fact that there is more than one other Aphek, that Tappuah on the borders of Ephraim and Manasseh seems to have been an important city, and that the cities of the south are mentioned first, those of the north afterwards, and that Tappuah seems to lie about midway, suggest the more northern city. This is Knobel's opinion. Gesenius inclines to the southern Tappuah. Conder identifies it with Yassfif, at the head of the Wady Kanah, southeast of Shechem. Vandevelde with Atuf, four hours northeast by east from Shechem. Keil prefers the former site. <span class="cmt_word">Hepher</span>. This appears, from <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-10.htm">1 Kings 4:10</a>, to have been near to Socoh, but nothing more is known of it. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">fortress</span>, though some think it comes from a Syriac root kindred to the Hebrew, signifying to <span class="accented">hold fast</span>, to <span class="accented">embrace</span>, and that it has reference to the sensual worship of Ashtaroth and Thammuz. There were several towns of this name (see notes on Joshua 13:4; 15:53; 19:30). <span class="cmt_word">Lasharon</span> is probably the same as Sharon, or Hasharon (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-9.htm">Isaiah 33:9</a>). This is the plain between Joppa and Carmel (Vandevelde). Conder and Kuobel identify with Sarona, or Saroneh, a place near the sea of Tiberias. See, however, <a href="../../par/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32-38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Madon</span> is mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>, and has been conjecturally identified with Madin, near the sea of Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">Shimron-meron</span> is also mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1</a>. It appears among the cities assigned to Zebulun in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>. Ewald ('Hist. Israel,' 2:2 c.) remarks on 'the antiquity of this list, referring as it does to cities which are never heard of again. <span class="cmt_word">Achshaph</span> lay within the borders of Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-25.htm">Joshua 19:25</a>). It has been supposed to be the modern Yasif, near the shores of the Mediterranean (see note on Joshua 11:1). <span class="cmt_word">Taanach and Megiddo</span> are frequently mentioned together (see <a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-27.htm">Judges 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). The former became a Levitical city. The latter, being in the great plain of Jezreel, or Esdraelon, lay in the way of most Eastern conquerors. Hence we find it mentioned in the Karnak inscription by the name of Magedi in the victorious expedition of Thothmes III., in which "the whole of the Syrian, Palestinian, and Arabian nations were overcome and forced to pay tribute." (Cooper, 'Egyptian Obelisks,' p. 33; see also 'Records of the Past,' 1:30). The great battle on the slopes of Mount Tabor was carried on as far as Megiddo (<a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>). Not far from this were the Midianites pitched, who fell victims to the valour of Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>). Another and a disastrous battle of Megiddo, against the king of Egypt, weakened Judaea, and caused it to fall an easy victory to the power of Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-20.htm">2 Chronicles 35:20-24</a>. The valley of Megiddo, or Megiddon, is mentioned in <a href="../../par/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a>. Solomon fortified Megiddo (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>), assigned it to Baana, the son of Ahilud, with Taanach, as one of the cities required to provide food for the royal household (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>.) And the Jewish writer of the Apocalypse makes this great battlefield of his race the scene of the battle of the great day of the Almighty (<a href="../../par/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14, 16</a>). For Armageddon is Har Mageddon, the mountain of Mageddon, or Megiddo. Megiddo and Taanach are also found in later periods of Egyptian history. The Mohar mentioned above (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>) notices the former among the places he visited ('Records of the Past,' vol. 2), while the latter is among the places captured by Shishak, as an inscription testifies. The latest explorers reject the identification with Lcgio, or Lejjun, and suggest Mejedda, at the foot of Gilboa, near Beth-shean. See Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Paper, January, 1877.

It has been identified by explorers, from Robinson downwards, with Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of Mount Carmel. It is the Cammona, or Cimana, of the Onomasticon, the "Cyamon over against Esdraelon" of Judith 7:3. It was a Levitical city (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a>), but in the list in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>. we miss it in its proper place, and find it taking the place of Kibzaim in Ephraim. But, as the margin of our version remarks in the latter chapter (ver. 68), the names of the cities in the two lists very frequently do not correspond. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a></div><div class="verse">The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the nations of Gilgal, one;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The nations of Gilgal.</span> Or <span class="accented">the nations</span> that belong <span class="accented">to Gilgal</span>. This is identified by Yandevelde and Conder with Jiljulieh in the plain of Jordan, north of Antipatris, and is therefore, if this identification be correct, a third Gilgal. The word "nations" most probably signifies a diversity of tribes of various races gathered together under the headship of the king of Gilgal, much in the same way that the kingdom of Mercia arose in England from a confused mass of various tribes, gathered together on the <span class="accented">marches</span>, or military frontiers, between Britons, Saxons and English, or in the same way that the Austrian and Turkish empires have been formed out of a congeries of various nationalities. So we read of "Tidal king of nations" in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>. But others regard the "nations" (Goim) mentioned there as equivalent to the Gutinm of the Babylonian tablets - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Semitic tribes imperfectly organised, then dwelling in Babylonia, and prefer the LXX. reading, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;</span>, in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>, which Sir Henry Rawlinson considers equivalent to the Accadian Tur Gal, or "great chief."

Jeroboam's wife went thither after her interview with Ahijah (Joshua 14:17). Baasha dwelt there (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21, 33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>), Elah was slain there by Zimri (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-9.htm">Joshua 16:9, 10</a>), and it. remained the capital until Omri built Samaria (Joshua 16:23, 24). Thenceforward we hear no more of it till the time of Menahem (<a href="../../par/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14, 16</a>), when it disappears from history. It has been variously identified - by Robinson and Yandevelde (whom Knobel follows) with Talluza, two hours journey north of Shechem; by Conder with Teiasu, where there are numerous rock sepulchres. It was a place of great beauty, if we may judge from <a href="../../par/songs/6-4.htm">Song of Solomon 6:4</a>, "Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/13.htm"><title>Joshua 13 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/13.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/13.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/13-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/12.htm" title="Joshua 12">&#9668;</a> Joshua 13 <a href="../joshua/14.htm" title="Joshua 14">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now Joshua was old <i>and</i> stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old <i>and</i> stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - NOW <span class="cmt_word">Joshua was old.</span> This is usually regarded as the second part of the Book of Joshua; the first being devoted to the history of the conquest of Palestine, while the second is engaged with the history of its division among the conquerors. Dean Stanley, in his 'Sinai and Palestine,' as well as in his 'Lectures on the History of the Jewish Church,' describes this portion of the Book of Judges as the 'Domes. day Book' of the land of Canaan, and the remark has been constantly repeated. There is, however, a considerable difference between the great survey of the Conqueror and this one. The former was an accurate account, for purposes of taxation, national detente, and public order, of the exact extent of soil owned by each landowner, and it went so far as to enumerate the cattle on his estate, to the great disgust of the Saxon chronicler, who had an Englishman's dislike of inquisitorial proceedings. There is no trace either of such completeness, or of such an inquisitorial character in this survey, neither has it quite the same object. It assigns to each tribe the limits of its future possessions, and enumerates the cities contained in each portion of territory. Bat it makes scarcely any effort to describe the possessions of particular families, still less of individual landowners. Joshua and Caleb are the only exceptions. Knobel observes that the most powerful tribes were first settled in their territory - those, namely, of Judah and Joseph. He remarks that the author must have had written sources for his information, for no single Israelite could have been personally acquainted with all the details here given. <span class="cmt_word">And stricken in years.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">advanced in age.</span> There is no foundation for the idea of some commentators that the Jews, at the time this book was written, made any formal distinction in these words between different stages of old age. The Hebrew language rejoiced in repetition, and this common phrase is only a means of adding emphasis to the statement already made. <span class="cmt_word">And there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> is stronger than our version. Perhaps the best equivalent in modern English is, <span class="accented">"And the amount of land that remaineth for us to occupy is very great indeed."</span> We may observe here that, as with the literal so with the spiritual Israel, whether the antitype be the Christian Church or the human heart, the work of subduing God's enemies is gradual. One successful engagement does not conclude the war. The enemy renews his assaults, and when force fails he tries fraud; when direct temptations are of no avail he resorts to enticements. The only safeguard in the war is strength, alertness, courage, patience. The faint hearted and unwatchful alike fail in the contest, which can be carried on successfully only by him who has learned to keep guard over himself, and to direct his ways by the counsels of God.

Masius suggests the French <span class="accented">marque</span> (which was the old German <span class="accented">mark</span>), and the modern German <span class="accented">grenze.<span class="cmt_word"></span> All the borders of the Philistines.</span> Literally, all the <span class="accented">circles</span> (Geliloth) of the Philistines. The expression is found in several places in this book (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10, 11</a>). We may compare the expression the <span class="accented">circles</span> of Swabia, Franconia, <span class="accented">etc</span>., in the history of Germany. The expression here may have more affinity with what is known as the "mark system" in the history of ancient Germany, and refer to the patch of cultivated ground which extended for some distance round each city. But this is rendered improbable by the fact that one circle only retained its name (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>), and is still known as Galilee (see notes on these passages). Galilee was too large a district to have been originally a clearing round a town. <span class="cmt_word">Geshur</span> (see note on Joshua 12:5). Ewald (see also Hitzig,' Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) conjectures that these Geshurites were the aboriginal inhabitants of the country (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>), and were the same as the Avites or Avvites. See next verse, where the Avvites are distinguished from the five lords of the Philistines. It is worthy of remark that the name Talmai, the name of one of the "sons of Anak" (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>), comes in again as the name of a king of Geshur (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a> 13:37). It occurs, however, as a Hebrew name in Bartholomew, or Bar-Tolmai, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the son of Talmai, or Tolmai, one of the twelve apostles. Ewald supposes that these aborigines were dispossessed by the Canaanitish tribes, and that the old name of Geshur was still applied to those regions on which this primitive race had retained its hold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">From Sihor, which <i>is</i> before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, <i>which</i> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Sihor.</span> This word, which has the article in Hebrew, is literally <span class="accented">the black river.</span> This has been thought to be the Nile, known to both Greeks and Latins by that title.

The LXX. translates by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The phrase which is "before" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) Egypt seems to exclude the idea of the Nile, since the Nile flowed through the centre of Egypt, and it is impossible to make <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>. As Drusins remarks, moreover, the Nile is always called either <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> or "the river of Egypt." The interpreation which has found most favour of late, therefore, refers this expression to a small river that flows into the sea at the extreme southern border of Palestine. This river was known as the "river of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and is now called the <span class="accented">Wady-el-Arisch</span> (cf. also <a href="../../par/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4, 47</a>, as well as <a href="../../par/numbers/34-5.htm">Numbers 34:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/27-12.htm">Isaiah 27:12</a>, where the word is <span class="accented">nahal</span>, or <span class="accented">winter torrent</span>, a word inapplicable to the Nile). For Sihor, or Shichor, see <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-3.htm">Isaiah 23:3</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>, and especially <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>, which seems decisive against the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">Which is counted to the Canaanite.</span> These words are connected by the Masorites with what follows: <span class="accented">The five lords of the Philistines are reckoned to the Canaanite.<span class="cmt_word"></span> The five lords of the Philistines.</span> The Philistines (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>. Cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-12.htm">1 Chronicles 1:12</a>) are supposed to be of Egyptian origin. Ewald (also Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' p. 20) believes Caphtor to be Crete, and supposes the Cherethites and Pelethites who formed David's body-guard (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) to be Cretans and Philistines (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>). But this opinion is disputed by many commentators of note, and is far from probable in itself. They were David's most trusted and faithful troops, and it seems hardly probable that so truly national a monarch would have assigned the post of honour around his person to the hereditary enemies of his race. Ritter, however, believes the Cherethites and Pelethites to be Philistines, and appeals to <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>, and still more forcibly to <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4, 5</a>. It should be remembered, too, that Ittai was a Gittite, or native of Gath (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>). The term here used, translated <span class="accented">lords</span> (<span class="accented">satraps</span>, LXX.), is peculiar to the Philistines. It is to be found also in <a href="../../par/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>, <span class="accented">etc</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-30.htm">1 Kings 7:30</a> the word means an <span class="accented">axle</span>, or perhaps the outside plating of the wheel, and in the kindred languages it signifies a wheel. The expression is remarkable in connection with the phrase "circles of the Philistines." <span class="cmt_word">The Eshkalalonites.</span> The inhabitants of Ashkelon, as the Gittites are of Gath. <span class="cmt_word">Also the Avites.</span> Literally, "and <span class="accented">the Avites."</span> There is no "also" in the original, though the Avites or Avim are supposed (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>, and note on Geshuri in the last verse)to have been aborigines preceding the Canaanites, and dispossessed by the Philistines. Keil, however, disputes this view, and holds that we have no evidence that any but a Canaanitish people dwelt in southwestern Palestine. This Canaanitish tribe, he thinks, was driven out by the Philistines. Some few of the Avites, or rather Avvites, continued to dwell among their conquerors. But the coincidence between <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22, 23</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>, makes strongly for Ewald's view above. And Keil and Delitzsch, in their later joint work, incline to it. See Introduction III. The word Avvim, like Havoth, or Havvoth (see ver. 30), is supposed to mean villages, or inhabited enclosures. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-4.htm">Joshua 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that <i>is</i> beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the south.</span> The LXX. and the best modern commentators connect these words with what precedes. This gives a better sense than joining it to what follows. For the south was not "all the land of the Canaanites," but a large part of it belonged, as we have just seen, to a tribe not of Canaanitish origin, while the land of the Canaanites (see note on Joshua 3:10) extended far to the northward. Therefore we must understand the words "all the land of the Canaanites" to begin a fresh section, and to be descriptive of the territory extending from Philistia northward towards Sidon. So the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic. <span class="cmt_word">Mearah</span>. The margin has "the cave." But there is no article in the original The LXX. reads <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> for Mearah, having clearly, as Masius observes, substituted Zain for Resh. But this mistaken reading compels a mistranslation of the passage. Vandevelde supposes it to be a remarkable cave still existing near Sidon, which is mentioned by William of Tyre as having been fortified by the Crusaders. He speaks of it as <span class="accented">municipium quoddam</span>, and states that it was commonly known as the "cave of Tyre." "spelunca inexpugnabilis." It was afterwards "the last retreat of the Emir Fakkr-ed-Din" (Vandevelde, s.v. Mearah). There is a village now, north of Sidon, called Mog-heiriyeh, or the village of the cave. So also Kuobel. <span class="cmt_word">Beside the Sidonians.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">near</span>, or <span class="accented">in the direction of</span>, or <span class="accented">which belong to the</span> Sidonians. <span class="cmt_word">Aphek</span>. Or <span class="accented">Aphekah.</span> This (Knobel) was the northern Aphek (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-30.htm">Joshua 19:30</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31</a>), in the tribe of Asher, known later as Aphaca, and now as Afka. Not the Aphekah of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>, probably the Aphek of <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-1.htm">1 Samuel 4:1</a>. It is the same Aphek which in later times was captured by the Syrians, and was the scene of several decisive victories of Israel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>). It is doubtful which Aphek is meant in <a href="../../par/joshua/12-18.htm">Joshua 12:18</a>, though it is probably the southern Aphek. The situation is described as one of "rare beauty" (Delitzsch), "on the northwest slopes of Lebanon," amid exquisite groves (Conder). Here the Syrian Astarte was worshipped, and the ruins of her temple, dedicated to her as mourning for Tammuz, or Adonis, may still be seen. See Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' 310,311, and Mover's 'Die Phonizier,' 1:192. Perhaps it was never actually occupied by the Asherites, but remained in the hands of Syria, and as a place of great resort was the natural point to which the attacks of Israel would be directed. Vandevelde, however, believes in four and Conder in <span class="accented">seven</span> cities of this name, and they suppose the Aphek which was the scene of the battle with the Syrians to have been on the east of Jordan, from the occurrence of the word "Mishor" in the narrative in <a href="../../par/1_kings/20.htm">1 Kings 20</a>. The term "Mishor" is, however, applied to other places beside the territory east of Jordan (see Gesenius, s.v. Mishor). The Aphek in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a> cannot be identified with any that have been named. <span class="cmt_word">To the borders of the Amorites.</span> This can hardly be anything but the northern border of the kingdom of Bashan, in the neighbourhood of Mount Hermon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Giblites.</span> The inhabitants of Gebal, called Jebail (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, hill city, from <span class="accented">Jebel</span>) by the Arabs, and Byblus by the Greeks. This is Masius's idea, and other commentators have accepted it (see 1 Kings 5:32; <a href="../../par/psalms/83-7.htm">Psalm 83:7</a>; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>, where the LXX. translates by Byblus). In the first named passage the word is translated "stone squarers," in our version (where it is the 18th and not the 32nd verse). All the other versions render "Giblites" as here, and no doubt the inhabitants of the Phoenician city of Jebail are meant, since in the ruins of Jebail the same kind of masonry is found as is seen in Solomon's temple. Byblus (Kenriek, 'Phoenicia,' l.c. Movers, l.c. Lenormant, 'Manual of the History of the East,' if. 223) was the great seat of the worship of Tammuz, or Adonis. Here his father Cinyras was supposed to have been king, and the licentious worship, with its corrupting influences, was spread over the whole region of Lebanon and even Damascus. This territory was never actually occupied by the Israelites (see for this passage also <a href="../../par/joshua/11-8.htm">Joshua 11:8, 17</a>; and Joshua 12:7). <span class="cmt_word">Hamath</span>. The spies penetrated nearly as far as this (Numbers 42:21), and David reduced the land into subjection as far as the borders of this territory. But the Israelites never subdued it. Toi, king of Hamath, was an ally, not a tributary of David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-9.htm">2 Samuel 8:9</a>). The border of Israel is always described as extending "to the entering in of Hamath" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>), though Jeroboam II. is said to have "recovered" (v. 28) Hamath itself. This "entering in of Hamath" commences at the end of the region called Coele Syria, according to Robinson, 'Later Biblical Researches,' see. 12, at the northeast end of the Lebanon range. So Vandevelde and Porter. Vandevelde remarks that the expression refers to an "entrance formed by Nature herself," namely, the termination of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon ranges. The city of Hamath, which gave its name to the territory, is situated on the Orontes, and was known later as Epiphaneia, no doubt after Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria.

A large portion of the Sidonian territory was taken, but Sidon retained its independence (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-31.htm">Judges 1:31, 32</a>). It is clear, too, that the promise was conditional.

These two are probably the "cities of Aroer" referred to in <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a> (but see next note but one, where also <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> will be discussed). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> A city in Judah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-28.htm">1 Samuel 30:28</a>).

In <a href="../../par/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, instead of "the city that is in the midst of the river," we find simply "the middle (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5da;</span>) of the river." But as <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-5.htm">2 Samuel 24:5</a> stands in our version, the city referred to stood in the middle of the <span class="accented">river of Gad.</span> This would suggest the idea that the old derivation of Aroer by Wells and others from the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (city) doubled, with the signification of the <span class="accented">double city</span>, is nearer the mark than that of <span class="accented">wasteness</span>, or <span class="accented">desolateness</span>, or nakedness, as of a region bare of trees, which has found favour of late, and it is not without support in Hebrew forms. A city, moreover, in the midst of or "on the brink of" a winter torrent would be less likely to be waste or desolate than in other situations. But we are not yet at the end of our difficulties. The word Nahal, which comes before Gad in the passage of which we are now speaking, has the article. Thus the translation, "river of Gad" cannot be maintained. And besides, the enumeration of the people must have begun at the Arnon, or southern border of Israel beyond Jordan. It is possible that the text may be corrupt here, as it is in other parts of 2 Samuel, and possibly the meaning may be that the officers pitched in Aroer, passed through Reuben, and having come within the confines of Gad arrived at Jazer. This again is rendered doubtful by the close connection of Aroer and Jazer in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. It is of course, therefore, possible that the reference in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>. is to the Jabbok, not the Arnon ravine. A question, of such intricacy can only be Settled, if settled at all, by an investigation on. the spot. <span class="cmt_word">The plain.</span> The word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>.

Flat, and almost unbroken, even by trees, it was particularly adapted for grazing land (see also note above, and on ver. 4). <span class="cmt_word">Medeba</span>. This is mentioned in Scripture, together with Dibon, as here in <a href="../../par/numbers/21-30.htm">Numbers 21:30</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>. It was on the level ground before mentioned (see Gesenius, s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>). Dibon (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/48-18.htm">Jeremiah 48:18, 22</a>, called Dimon in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-9.htm">Isaiah 15:9</a>; but Dibon in <a href="../../par/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; see also <a href="../../par/numbers/33-45.htm">Numbers 33:45, 46</a>). It was one of the cities built by the children of Gad (<a href="../../par/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>). It is now called Dhiban, and is a short distance north of the Arnon. The Moabite stone, found at Dibon in 1868, mentions the occupation of Medeba by Omri, and implies that Dibon, the principal city in those parts, was also subject to him, but recovered finally by Mesha.

Like the clergy under the Christian dispensation, it was seen that they could not at once perform the duties of the priesthood, and act as instructors of the people, if they were burdened, like the rest, with the duty of carrying on war. Their place was supplied by the division of the tribe of Joseph into two, so that the inheritance of Israel was still divided among twelve tribes. Bahr, in his 'Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 2:48, 49, gives other reasons for the dispersion of the Levites throughout the land. If the Levites were to keep the Law and Word of God, to take measures for its being properly kept by the nation in general, to spread abroad a knowledge of the precepts of the religion of Israel, to stir up the tribes to a devout and religious life, it was not merely desirable, but absolutely necessary, that they should be scattered among the tribes. On the other hand, to secure a proper <span class="accented">esprit de corps</span>, a mutual sustaining influence, and a common action, too complete a dispersion would have been a mistake. Hence their collection into the Levitical cities, which, however (see note on Joshua 21:11), were not given up wholly to them. The Divine wisdom which dictated the provisions of the Mosaic law is clearly visible here. The instinct of the Christian Church in early times devised a similar provision for the evangelisation of the people in the organisation of the ancient and mediaeval cathedrals. <span class="cmt_word">As he said unto them.</span> This quotation of <a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20, 24</a> by a later writer would, under all ordinary circumstances, be regarded as a proof that the Book of Joshua was quoting one of the books of Moses. But the "Elohistic" and "Jehovistic" theory escapes this conclusion in the cumbrous fashion to which reference has been already made. Origen regards this passage as symbolical of the more spiritually earnest among the laity, who" so excel others invirtue of mind and grace of merits, as that the Lord should be called their inheritance." "How very rare," he says, "are those who devote themselves to wisdom and knowledge and preserve their mind clear and pure, and exercise their minds in all excellent virtues, who illuminate the way wherein they walk for simpler souls by the grace of learning, and thus attain to salvation. They are the true priests and Levites, whose inheritance is the Lord, who is wisdom" (Hom. 17 on Joshua). <span class="cmt_word">The Sacrifices.</span> The word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">fire.</span> It does not itself, as Keil asserts, <span class="accented">signify</span> <span class="accented">fire</span> in any place in Holy Writ, but it is used of the shewbread in <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-7.htm">Leviticus 24:7, 9</a>. It thus came to mean any sacrifice, whether offered by fire or not. And thus the tenth which (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21, 23, 24</a>) was given to the Levites, as being offered for God's service, might be reckoned as in some sense a sacrifice. With this passage we may compare various passages in the New Testament, where, in this respect at least, the Christian ministry stands on the same footing (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-11.htm">1 Corinthians 9:11, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6, 7</a>). Thus the maintenance of the Christian ministry is a kind of sacrifice - as we find such deeds called, in fact, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>. And an order of men who are set apart to the ministry of souls has a right to claim a sufficient maintenance at the hands of those to whom they minister - a point which in these days of affluence and clerical destitution combined ought to be more largely recognised than it is (see <a href="../../par/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). "For the law is entrusted to the priests and Levites, and they devote their energies to this alone, and without any anxiety are able to give their time to the Word of God. But that they may be able to do this, they ought to depend upon the support of the laity. For if the laity do not allow the priests and Levites all the necessaries of life, they would be obliged, to engage themselves in temporal occupations, and would thus have less time for the law of God. And when they had no time to spare for the study of God's law, it is thou who wouldst be in danger. For the light of knowledge that is in them would grow dim, because thou hast given no oil for the lamp, and through thy fault it would come to pass, what the Lord said, 'If the blind lead the blind, shall they not both fall into the ditch?'" (Orig., Hom. 17 on Joshua). These words are well worthy of attention now, when a multiplicity of worldly business and a weight of worldly cares are devolved upon God's ministers by a laity which has to too great an extent washed its hands of all cooperation in the work of God's Church.

This passage is an expansion of <a href="../../par/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33-42</a>. We learn from it that the Israelites actually took possession of this land. But in the reigns of the wicked kings Omri and Ahab the power of Israel declined, and after the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and the defeat and death of Ahab, the Moabites succeeded in shaking off the Israelitish yoke, and in wresting from Israel moreover a considerable portion of the territory of Sihon. In the next reign an attempt was made to regain possession of the lost territory. We learn from the Moabite stone that the important towns here mentioned, Medeba, Dibon, Baalmeon, Kiriathaim (or Kirjathalm, as it is here called), Ataroth, Nebo, Aroer, had fallen into the hands of Mesha at the rebellion, and that he had erected a citadel at Dibon, which had become his capital. Hence the endeavour to invade Moab from the south, recorded in <a href="../../par/1_kings/3.htm">1 Kings 3</a>, which, however, though successful as a military promenade, was attended with no permanent results. For Isaiah (ch. 15.)and Jeremiah (ch. 48.) mention most of these places, as well as Elealeh and Heshbon, the former capital of Sihon, as being strongholds of the Moabite power. Jahaz, too, the place where Sihon gave battle of the Israelites, is numbered by Mesha, as well as at a later date by Isaiah and Jeremiah, among the possessions of Moab; while Horonaim, mentioned among the Moabite cities by the two prophets, is incidentally noticed by Mesha as having been captured from the Edomites.

Such touches as this, which display the minute acquaintance of our author with his subject, are almost of a necessity lost in a translation.

With this passage compare <a href="../../par/numbers/31-8.htm">Numbers 31:8</a>. The Hebrew has no "with," so that the difficulty some have found in the passage need not have arisen. It is nowhere said that Moses smote the "princes of Midian" together with Sihon. All that is stated is that they, as well as Sihon, were smitten, as the history in Numbers tells us they were. Dukes of Sihon. According to Gesenius, Rosenmiiller, and others, the word here translated "dukes" is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> <span class="accented">to pour out</span>, means "anointed." See Psalm if. 6, where it is translated "set." But Keil rejects this interpretation, and says that the word never signifies to anoint. It is always used, he says, of <span class="accented">foreign</span> princes. But he has overlooked <a href="../../par/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> (Hebrews). See Knobel, who explains it of drink offerings, and regards these "dukes" as men pledged by a solemn treaty to be Sihon's allies, though not vassals. Kimchi thinks that Sihon, before his reverses at the hand of Israel, had held some authority in Midian, and these were his prefects, or under-kings. The term is applied to Zebah and Zalmunna in <a href="../../par/psalms/83-12.htm">Psalm 83:12</a> (in the Hebrew).

The LXX. translates, "And the borders of Reuben were the Jordan-border." This seems to be the meaning of the original. The phrase often occurs, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-12.htm">Joshua 15:12</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>. Knobel's explanation is probably the correct one, that the phrase means to refer to the natural boundary marked out by the river or sea and its banks. "The boundary of the children of Reuben was Jordan and the natural boundary thus formed." As Dean Stanley reminds us in his 'Lectures on the Jewish Church,' Reuben, as predicted by Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), sank at once into insignificance.

In the primitive villages of Servia, where wild beasts are not entirely extirpated, not only are all the homesteads enclosed, but a fence is placed across the road, and removed when a vehicle has to pass through. Or perhaps the primitive Jewish community was similar to the primitive Teutonic community as described by Marshall in his 'Elementary and Practical Treatise on Landed Property,' published in 1804, who described the early distribution of land in this country as follows: "Round the village lay a few small enclosures for rearing young stock. Further a field the best land for arable purposes was chosen, and divided into three parts, for the necessary, rotation of fallow, wheat or rye, and spring crops. The meadows near the water courses were set aside for the growth of fodder for the cattle or for pasturage for milch cows, <span class="accented">etc</span>. The irreclaimable lands were left for what we now call 'common' uses for fuel, and the inferior pasturage." These arrangements are found to exist in India (see Sir H. Maine, 'Village Communities,' sec. 4.). But there, as in Palestine, the necessity for water was the cause of important modifications.

While both inhabited a similar tract of country, a country from its open and pastoral character likely to develop a hardy and healthy race of men, the Reubenites were exposed to the seductions of the Moabitish worship of Chemosh, which, when combined with an ancestral temperament by no means prone to resist such influences (see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>), soon proved fatal to a tribe, itself not numerous (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>), and hemmed in on every side but the north by the unbelievers. The temperament inherited by the Gadites added to their more favourable situation and the nature of their pursuits, developed a hardy and warlike race ready to do battle, and fearless of their foes (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>). Of this tribe came the valiant Jephthah, and of it also came the brave soldiers of David, whose qualifications stir to poetry the sober chronicler of Judah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). We may see here the influence of circumstances on the character of a people. Originally (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18</a>) the Reubenites and the Gadites were alike. But the Reubenites, as we have seen, from unfavourable surroundings, lost the character which the Gadites, more favourably situated, were enabled to preserve. And the distinctions of tribes, producing as they did a separate <span class="accented">esprit de corps in</span> each tribe, will serve to explain why one tribe did not immediately succumb to influences which proved fatal to another. In the end, as we know, all the people of Gad fell victims to the temptations which surrounded them, and, save in the case of Levi, Judah, and Benjamin, and the few faithful Israelites who went over to them, irrevocably. The same phenomenon may be observed in the history of nations generally. As long as their manners were simple and their morals pure, they have preserved their liberty, and in many cases have acquired empire. As soon as their bodies were enervated by luxury, and their minds corrupted by vice, they fell a prey to foes whom formerly they would have despised. Thus fell the Greek and Boman republics, thus the Britons became an easy prey to the Saxons, and the Saxons to the Danes. In every instance the history of a tribe and of a nation serves to illustrate the maxim that "righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people."

Is it seriously contended that one half of this verse is taken from one author, and the other from another? Or is it possible that the writer of the book may actually have understood the language he was using, and meant to use the two words in somewhat different senses? Gesenius, it is true, would explain the words as being precisely synonymous. But his own etymological remarks are fatal to his theory. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> the latter of the two words, is a <span class="accented">bough</span>, or <span class="accented">shoot</span> (derived from a word signifying to <span class="accented">grow</span>), capable of throwing out blossoms (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a>). It refers, therefore, to the natural descent of the tribe from Manasseh their father. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is allied to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e4;&#x5d8;</span>; to judge, and the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the English <span class="accented">shaft</span>, and signifies a rod as the emblem of authority. Thus it is used in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, of a royal sceptre. So <a href="../../par/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a>, an iron sceptre, <a href="../../par/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6</a>. Thus the latter word has reference to the tribe as an organised community, the former to it in reference to its ancestral derivation. This view would seem to be supported by ver. 24, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> of Gad is further explained to mean his <span class="accented">sons and their families</span>, as well as by this verse, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5d8;</span> is used absolutely, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d8;&#x5d4;</span> in connection with the family

So we use the phrase "five," as synonymous with "dwell." Why the term is confined to these particular cities is not known. Gesenius regards it as equivalent to "nomadic encampment." But the ruins of the giant cities of Bashan, recently rediscovered in our own time (by Mr. Cyril Graham, in 1857), and displaying all the signs of high civilisation, dispose of this idea. These cities are mentioned in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-4.htm">Deuteronomy 3:4</a> as "threescore cities, all the region of Argob," and again in ver. 13, "all the region of Argob with all Bashan, which is called the land of giants." "To the east he (Abraham) would leave the barren and craggy fatnesses of the formidable Argob, still (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in Abraham's time, not Joshua's) the asylum of the fiercest outlaws; and would jealously avoid the heathen haunts in groves and on high places where smoke arose to the foul image, and the frantic dance swept round." (Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 69. See also note on 'Judah upon Jordan,' <a href="../../par/joshua/19-34.htm">Joshua 19:34</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Threescore cities</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a>). It was the martial character, as well as the half tribe of Manasseh, that qualified him to receive and subdue this important territory with its wide extent and teeming population. In the article on Manasseh in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' reference is made to the fact that, while Ephraim only sent 20,800, and Western Manasseh 18,000, Reuben, Gad, and Eastern Manasseh sent the immense number of 120,000, and this while Abner, the supporter of Ishbosheth, had his headquarters at Mahanaim. But the numbers are suspicious, especially when Judah, always a powerful tribe, comes below the insignificant tribe of Simeon in number. And a comparison of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a> with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-22.htm">1 Chronicles 12:22, 23</a>, would lead to the idea that the coronation of David after the death of Ishbosheth is the event referred to (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-38.htm">1 Chronicles 12:38-40</a>).

The question is of no great practical importance; but no doubt the contrivance was a very primitive one, as the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> a small pebble, used here, seems to imply. What is of more importance is the fact that the distribution of territory was the result of no one's caprice, or ambition, or intrigue. The whole matter was referred to God, and the leader of the Israelitish hosts and the high priest presided over the ceremony. It was a common belief among the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, that the use of the lot was to refer the matter to a Divine decision. So we read in the Proverbs, "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>; cf. 18:18). It is a strong evidence for the truth of this narrative that we read of no conflicts between the various tribes respecting the division of territory. Jealousies sprung up between the tribes, as the narratives in <a href="../../par/judges/8.htm">Judges 8, 9, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>, are sufficient to show. But in no one case was there any complaint of unfairness, any attempt to disturb the territorial arrangement made at the time of the original settlement in Palestine. There can be little doubt that Keil is right in supposing this original division to have been in outline merely. It is obvious from the onward course of the narrative (especially ch. 18.) that no very minute accuracy in detail could possibly have been arrived at. The country was roughly mapped out at first, and the complete adjustment of boundaries was a matter which would naturally be put off until the land were actually in possession.

The passage is a simple repetition of what we find in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14, 33</a>, and is added here to explain how the twelve tribes who actually divided the land were composed. <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs</span>. Rather, "pasture lands;" literally, places where the cattle were <span class="accented">driven out</span> to pasture (cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/13-2.htm">1 Chronicles 13:2</a>, where the Hebrew is "cities of driving out"). We may illustrate this phrase by the similar arrangements made by the Germanic tribes in early times. "The clearing," says Professor Stubbs, in his 'Constitutional History of England,' p. 49, "is surrounded by a thick border of wood or waste .... In the centre of the clearing the village is placed .... The fully qualified freeman has a share in the land of the community. He has a right to the enjoyment of the woods, the pastures, the meadow and the arable land of the mark.... The use of the meadow land is definitely apportioned .... When the grass beans to grow the cattle are driven out, and the meadow is fenced round and divided into as many equal shares as there are mark families in the village. For the arable land similar measures are taken although the task is somewhat more complex" (see note on Joshua 13:23). Some similar arrangement must have taken place in the primitive Jewish settlement of Palestine. For the rude huts of the Teutonic tribes we must substitute the more civilised "cities, walled up to heaven," of the Phoenician races; for the scanty supply of gram and pasture, provided by a northern climate, we must substitute the rich plenty of a land "flowing with milk and honey," and with all the produce of a southern sky. The area of land assigned to each of the Levitical cities was definitely marked out (see <a href="../../par/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4, 5</a>), and subdivided, as the hints in the narrative seem to imply that all the land was, into as many sections as there were "mark families" - that is, families of freemen exclusive of the servile classes in the town.

As far as we can make out from the genealogy in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2.htm">1 Chronicles 2</a>, Caleb and Kenaz were family names, for the Caleb or Calubi (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9</a>) the son of Hezron (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-18.htm">1 Chronicles 2:18</a>), the Caleb the son of Hur (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50</a>), and Caleb the son of Jephunneh (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>), could not have been the same persons. And Caleb was a Kenezite, or descendant of Kenaz; he had a grandson, apparently, of that name (so the LXX. and Vulgate translate, <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-15.htm">1 Chronicles 4:15</a>), and a brother, according to the most probable rendering of the Hebrew of both <a href="../../par/joshua/15-17.htm">Joshua 15:17</a> and <a href="../../par/judges/1-9.htm">Judges 1:9</a>. See also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-13.htm">1 Chronicles 4:13</a>. For Caleb was the son of Jephunneh, not of Kenaz. Hitzig, 'Geschichte des Volkes Israel,' 1:105, thinks that Caleb was a descendant of the Kenaz mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>; or, see 15. Some think he was a Kenizzite (see <a href="../../par/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19</a>). The Bishop of Bath and Wells, in his article in Smiths 'Dictionary of the Bible,' thinks that the view that he was not of Jewish origin agrees best with the Scripture narrative, and removes many difficulties regarding the number of the children of Israel at the Exodus. It certainly serves to explain why the tribe of Judah came with Caleb, when he preferred his request, and the statement in ch. 15:13, which seems to imply that Caleb was not one of the tribe of Judah by birth, but one of the "mixed multitude" that went up with the Israelites (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), and acquired afterwards by circumcision the rights of Israelites. If this be the case, it is an illustration of the truth declared in <a href="../../par/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/4-12.htm">Romans 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-7.htm">Galatians 3:7</a>. By his faithfulness to God he had well earned the reward which he now sought. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning me and thee.</span> And yet Knobel asserts that, according to vers. 8 and 12, Joshua was not one of the spies! He accordingly sees the hand of the "Jehovist" here. So accurate is the criticism which pretends to be able to disintegrate the narratives in the Hebrew Scriptures, and to assign each part to its separate author (see <a href="../../par/numbers/14-24.htm">Numbers 14:24</a>). As well might we conclude that this verse in <a href="../../par/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>. is by a different hand to vers. 30 and 38 in the same chapter, in spite of the obvious coherence of the whole narrative.

Houbigant and Le Clerc approve of this reading, but it seems quite out of keeping with the character of Caleb. He did not endeavour to accommodate his report to the wishes of any man, but gave what he himself believed to be a true and faithful account of what he had seen and heard (see <a href="../../par/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/14-7.htm">Numbers 14:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a>).

But this is not the fact, as a comparison of this passage with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-36.htm">Deuteronomy 1:36</a> will show. That either passage gives the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of Moses is unlikely. The main sense of the promise is given in each.

This remark has been made as far back as the time of Theedoret. Doubtless the apportionment of the land, and its occupation by the Israelites, was a long and tedious business (see also <a href="../../par/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even since.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">from the time when.</span>

In one of the hollows in this "hill country of Judaea" Hebron still nestles, but at a height which (see Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 102) is "only 400 feet lower than Helvellyn," the highest point but one in England. The Dean remarks on the fact that Palestine was a mountainous country, and that therefore in its history we may expect the characteristics of a mountain people. <span class="cmt_word">Whereof the Lord spake in that day.</span> There must therefore have been a promise made to Caleb, regarding which the Pentateuch, having to deal with matters of more general interest, is silent, that he should lead the forlorn hope, as it were, of the children of Israel, and that the task of subduing the mountain fastnesses of the most powerful tribes in Palestine should be assigned to him. That the original inhabitants reoccupied the districts round Hebron, while the Israelites were otherwise engaged, we have already seen (see note on Joshua 11:21). The final work was to be carried out by Caleb. Houbigant, it is true, thinks that here the same incident is referred to as in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21, 22</a>, and that Joshua is there credited with what was clone by Caleb at his command. But we read that that expedition followed close upon the battle of Merom, whereas seven years elapsed before the final expulsion of the Anakim by Caleb. It is important to notice that the author of the Book of Joshua has access to sources of information beside the Pentateuch. This, though not sufficient to disprove, does at least seem inconsistent with the "Elohist" and "Jehovist" theory. <span class="cmt_word">For thou heartiest in that day.</span> The LXX. and Vulgate avoid the difficulty here by referring these words to what goes before - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the promise made to Caleb. In that case we must render the second <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> "for," instead of "that," or "how." Joshua can hardly have heard for the first time that the Anakim were in Hebron if, as <a href="../../par/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22</a> appears to assert, he, in common with the other spies, had visited the place. But it is possible, though the narrative as it stands seems to suggest that they went together, that the spies went different ways, either separately or in pairs, and that Caleb visited Hebron, and that Joshua heard the account of it for the first time from Caleb's lips, as they brought their report to Moses, and that Caleb then asked and received the grant of Hebron. We may observe the minute agreement here in matters of detail between the Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua. The Pentateuch states that the spies visited Hebron. The Book of Joshua, without mentioning this, makes Caleb appeal to Joshua as a witness that a premise had been made to him, long before the entrance of Israel into the promised land, that this particular place should be allotted to him. The description of Hebron also in <a href="../../par/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>. agrees in every respect with what is stated here. <span class="cmt_word">Fenced</span>.

At the time of Joshua's invasion, however, it was known as Kirjath (or "the city of ") Arba, from a giant named Arba who had conquered the city. Hebron is known as Kirjath-arba in <a href="../../par/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>, but the way in which it is mentioned by Moses seems to bear out Hengstenberg's theory. The Rabbis translated "the city of four," and assert that the four patriarchs, Adam, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, were buried there. The word translated "man" here is Adam. The Vulgate follows this tradition, trans. lating "Adam maximus ibi inter Enacim situs est." And our own Wiclif literally translates the Vulgate "Adam moost greet there in the loond of Enachym was set." Rosenmuller renders the words translated "a great man" by "the greatest man." And certainly the words have the article; and this is also the way in which the superlative is expressed in Hebrew. It also adds to the force of Caleb's request. He desired the most important city of a warlike race. And the land had rest from war (see <a href="../../par/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 13"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 15"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/15.htm"><title>Joshua 15 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/15.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/15.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/15-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/14.htm" title="Joshua 14">&#9668;</a> Joshua 15 <a href="../joshua/16.htm" title="Joshua 16">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a></div><div class="verse"><i>This</i> then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; <i>even</i> to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward <i>was</i> the uttermost part of the south coast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot of the tribe of the children of Judah.</span> The first twelve verses of this chapter define the boundaries of Judah.

This wilderness was on the border of Edom (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>). Thence the border of Judah (which here includes the small portion afterwards allotted to Simeon) extended to the utmost limits of the south (see <a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>). A wall of mountains extends southwestward from the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, and formed the natural boundary of Judaea.

It is called the Lisan. Whoever was the writer of the Book of Joshua, these details prove him to have had an accurate acquaintance with the geography of Palestine. He was no priestly inventor of fables attached to the temple at Jerusalem. Canon Tristram gives a vivid description of the neighbourhood in his 'Land of Israel,' ch. 15. The ridge of Jebel Usdum - one large mass of rock salt - on the west of this "tongue" of water, the salt marsh of the Sebkha on the southwest, with its treeless waste - "not a plant or a leaf could be seen save just under the hills" - and its mirage like that of Sahara, the barren outline of the Lisan itself, to the eastward rising to an elevation of from five to six hundred feet, and the fertile oasis of the Ghor-es-Safieh at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea, give an unique character to this remarkable region. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a></div><div class="verse">And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim</span>.

The literal meaning of Maaleh-acrabbim is Scorpion Rise (see <a href="../../par/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a>). Keil thinks that it was a pass in the Mount Halak, or the Smooth Mountain, mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>. "De Saulcy suggests the Wady Zouara, and testifies to the scorpions found under every pebble" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 113). And Ainsworth, 'Travels in Asia Minor,' 2:354, says that some spots are almost uninhabitable in consequence. Knobel supposes it to be the pass es-Sufah on the road between Petra and Hebron. But the border of Judah seems to have gone in a southwesterly direction. <span class="cmt_word">To Zin.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">in the direction of</span> Zin. <span class="cmt_word">On the south side unto Kadesh-barnea</span>. Or, as above, <span class="accented">southward of Kadesh-barnea.</span> The exact position of Kadesh-Burnea has not been ascertained. It was between the wilderness of Zin and that of Paran (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>). Dean Stanley identifies it with Petra, which was about 30 miles in a northeasterly direction from the Gulf of Akaba on the Red Sea, and close to Mount Her. A more recent traveller (see Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' pp. 366-376) identifies it with Ain Gadis, about 60 miles to the westward of Petra, and he claims Winer, Kurz, Kalisch, and Knobel as supporters of his view. The latter founds his view on the discovery of Ain Gadis by Rowlands, and supports it by the authority of Ritter. Ritter, however, as his translator informs us, embodied the results of the investigations of Mr. Rowlands' while his work was preparing for the press, and did not give the matter that full consideration which he was accustomed to do. The chief objection to it is that (see vex. 1) Ain Gadis can hardly be described as on "the border of Edom." The general view is that it lay somewhat to the northeast of Hezron and to the northwest of Petra, at the foot of the range of mountains which form the southern boundary of Judesa. Here the spies brought their report to Moses (ch. 14:6, 7; <a href="../../par/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>). Here Miriam was buried, and where Moses incurred the wrath of God from his mode of working the miracle which supplied the Israelites with water (<a href="../../par/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>.). It was "a city in the uttermost border" of Edom (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>), and it was some distance from Mount Hor, for we find it described as a journey (<a href="../../par/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22</a>); and by passing from Kadesh to Mount Hor and thence by the way of the Red Sea, the Israelites "compassed the land of Edom" (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>), a fact which seems to prove that Petra and Kadesh-barnea were not the same place. Kadesh is supposed by M. Chabas to be the "Qodesh of the country of the Amaor," or Amorites, in the monuments of Seti I. and Rameses II. It is depicted as "on a hillside with a stream on one side," and is thus distinguished from Qodesh of the Kheta or Hittites, which is in a flat country beside a lake (Tomkins, 'Studies of the Time of Abraham,' p. 84). <span class="cmt_word">Fetched a compass to Karkaa.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">was deflected in the direction of Karkaa.</span> Nothing is known of the places here mentioned. Cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>, where Karkaa is not mentioned, but the deflection in the neighbourhood of Asmon is. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-4.htm">Joshua 15:4</a></div><div class="verse"><i>From thence</i> it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The river of Egypt</span> (see above, <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>). "Westward, as far as Egypt, there is a sandy, salt, barren, unfruitful, and uninhabitable waste" (Knobel). The land, he adds, is better near Gaza, but near the sea it is still pure waste. <span class="cmt_word">And the goings out of that coast were at the sea.</span> The word coast, derived through the French from the Latin <span class="accented">costa</span>, signifies, like it, a <span class="accented">side.</span> It is now used only of the border formed by the sea, but at an earlier period it had a wider signification. The Hebrew word is translated "border" in ver. 1. The meaning is that the boundary line of Judah ran as far as the sea. <span class="cmt_word">This shall be your south coast.</span> Or, <span class="accented">this shall be to you the southern bound</span>ary. The historian here quotes the directions given to Moses in <a href="../../par/numbers/34.htm">Numbers 34</a>, with the evident intention of pointing out that the south border of the children of Israel coincided with that of the tribe of Judah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the east border <i>was</i> the salt sea, <i>even</i> unto the end of Jordan.

It is still known as <span class="accented">Ain Hadjla</span> or <span class="accented">Hajla</span>, where, says Keil, a beautiful spring of fresh and clear water is to be found. The place lies about two miles from Jordan. Beth-hogla means "the house of the partridge." "Leaving the probable site of the ancient Gilgal and advancing southward along the pilgrims' route to the Jordan, an hour and a quarter brings us to the spring Kin Hajla, in a small and well-watered grove" (Ritter). He adds, "Robinson and Wilson both recognised in the name Hails the ancient Canaanitish city Beth-hogla." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-arabah.</span> Or "the house of the Arabah" or desert. Its site is not known (see ver. 61 and <a href="../../par/joshua/18-18.htm">Joshua 18:18, 22</a>).

The boundary of Benjamin in ch. 18, is mentioned in precisely reverse order, and since here the stone was on the ascent from Beth-araba, and there (ver. 17) it is described as on the descent from Geliloth, it must have been on the side of the declivity. Of Bohan nothing further is known. We must understand here, as in many other places of Scripture, <span class="accented">descendant</span> by "son" (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that <i>is</i> before the going up to Adummim, which <i>is</i> on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Toward Debir.</span> Not the Debir of ch. 10. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of Achor</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>).

It is called Geliloth, or "circles," in <a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>, where the same place is obviously meant as here. The question is one of some difficulty. If it be not the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>, which is described as being eastward of Jericho, still less can it be Jiljiliah (see note on Joshua 9:6) which was near Bethel, and therefore on the northern border of Benjamin. In that case the only supposition that will meet the facts in this case is that Gilgal, which signifies a wheel or circle, was the common name given to all the Israelitish encampments. But there seems no reason to doubt that the Gilgal of <a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a> is meant. This is Ewald's view in his 'History of Israel,' 2:245. <span class="cmt_word">Adummim,</span> or "the red (places)," has been identified with Maledomim, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Maaleh Adummim, or Talat el Dumm (Conder), on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho. Jerome explains it as "ascensus ruforum sen rubentium propter sanguinem qui iltic erebro a latronibus funditur." Every one will at once call to mind the narrative in St. <a href="../../par/luke/10.htm">Luke 10</a>, which has no doubt suggested this explanation. But at one particular point in the route from Jerusalem to Jericho a "large mass of purplish rock" is found (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 424, note). It was called "terra ruffa," "the red earth," from the colour of the ground, and recent travellers state that it is called the "red field" still, from this cause. Conder tells us the name is derived from "the brick-red marks here found amid a district of red chalk (see also Mr. Tyrwhitt Drake in Pal. Expl. Fund Quart. Paper, April, 1874). So Knobel speaks, on the authority of numberless travellers of "der rothen Farbe des dortigen gesteins." And the Quarterly Paper just quoted mentions the "bright limestone and marl." <span class="cmt_word">Which is on the south aide of the river.</span> The <span class="accented">Nahal</span>, or summer torrent, in the original; "the Wady Kelt, south of Riha" (Knobel). <span class="cmt_word">The waters of Eu-shemesh,</span> or the fountain of the sun, supposed to be Kin Hand, or the "Apostles' well," near Bethany. There is an <span class="accented">Arak</span> (cave) <span class="accented">esh Shems</span>, about two miles off. All these places have been identified on or near the pilgrims' route to the Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Enrogel</span> (see ch. 18:17). It was close by Jerusalem, and was where Jonathan and Ahimaaz lingered to gain tidings for David, and where Adonijah repaired to hold the great feast when he endeavoured to obtain the kingdom. "Now Kin Um ed Deraj in the Kedron Valley" (Conder). Vandevelde supposes it to be Bir Eyub, Joab's well, at the point where the Kedron Valley meets the Gai Hinnom. This seems most probable. <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the son of Hinnom.</span> The word here for valley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) signifies properly a deep cleft in the rock, through which no water flows. The valley of Hinnom has been generally taken to be the deep valley running from west to east, and lying to the west and south of Jerusalem, described by Tobler as forked at its northwestern end, bending to the southward about its middle, and joining the valley of Jehoshaphat at its eastern extremity. In the Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund for October, 1878, however, it is contended that the now partially filled up Tyropceon Valley, running through the city, is the valley or ravine of Hinnom. The manner in which this is demonstrated reminds the reader somewhat of a proposition in Euclid, and the question arises whether Euclid's method be exactly applicable to a point of this kind. The arguments used are not without force, but no notice is taken of the peculiar position of the valley of Rephaim (see next note but one), which, we learn from the sacred historian, was so placed that its extremity coincided with the mountain which closed the ravine of Hinnom at its western side. If the Tyropoeon Valley answers to this description, it may be accepted as the true valley of Hinnom, but not otherwise. Mr. Birch incorrectly cites Gesenius in favour of his theory; and the most recent discoveries appear to have thrown discredit upon it. The most weighty argument in favour of his theory is that a comparison of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-63.htm">Joshua 15:63</a> with <a href="../../par/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3-8</a>, leads to the supposition that Jerusalem was partly in Benjamin and partly in Judah (see, however, <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-30.htm">Nehemiah 11:30</a>). This valley, called sometimes Tophet, and sometimes, by a corruption of the Hebrew, Gehenna, whatever its situation may have been, is conspicuous in the after history of Israel. This deep and retired spot was the seat of all the worst abominations of the idol worship to which the Jews afterwards became addicted. Here Solomon reared high places for Moloch (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-7.htm">1 Kings 11:7</a>).

There the carcases of animals were east to be burned, and hence it is used by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>) as the type of the utmost wrath of God. It is hardly possible to suppose that there is no allusion to Tophet and its fiery sacrifices in <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-33.htm">Isaiah 30:33</a>, in spite of the different form of the word, to which some scholars, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Gesenius, assign an Aryan rather than a Semitic origin, and in spite of the fact that the LXX. suspects no such allusion there.

The city lay on the borders of Judah and Benjamin (see note on Joshua 10:1). <span class="cmt_word">The valley of the giants.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>). The word here translated valley is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>. In the former part it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (see note on last verse). The word here used signifies originally <span class="accented">depth</span>, and is applied to wide valleys embosomed among lofty hills. Such were the valley of Elah (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-2.htm">1 Samuel 17:2, 19</a>); the King's Dale (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-18.htm">2 Samuel 18:18</a>); the valley of Siddim (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-3.htm">Genesis 14:3</a>), of Jezreel (<a href="../../par/judges/6-33.htm">Judges 6:33</a>). "The word Emek shows that this was neither a winter torrent nor a narrow, dry ravine, and it is best identified with its traditional site, the shallow basin west of the watershed south of Jerusalem, now called el Bukei'a" (Conder). We read of this valley in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18, 22</a>. From these passages we may gather a confirmation of the view above expressed, that the valley here meant is an open valley, since only in such a valley could the Philistine army take up a position. It gradually narrows towards the southwest. On the south it extends as far as Bethlehem. The range of mountains which lie to the west of the valley of Hinnom from the northern boundary of the plain or valley of Rephaim. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which <i>is</i> Kirjathjearim:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was drawn.</span> Or, <span class="accented">extended. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The fountain of the waters of Nephtoah.</span> If these be identified with En Etam, as is done by the Rabbis (whom Conder follows), and if we suppose it to have supplied Jerusalem with water by the aqueduct which ran from a point southwest of Betlehem to Jerusalem, we must place it south of Bethlehem, and imagine that the border ran directly south here. Far more probable is the notion of Vandevelde, which places it northwest of Jerusalem, at Ain Lifta. Conder's view is dominated by the situation he has assigned to Kirjath-jearim (see note on Joshua 9:17). If the view there given in these notes is sound, the border now ran in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem to within five miles of Gibeon (see also note on Joshua 18:14). <span class="cmt_word">Kirjath-jearim.</span> See <a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>. To the authorities mentioned there in favour of Kuriet el Enab we may add Knobel, Ritter, and Tristram, in his last book, 'Bible Lands.' The view taken above corresponds to the minuteness of detail with which the boundary is given. To place Nephtoah south of Bethlehem and Kirjath-jearim at 'Arma would make the boundary far less distinct. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/15-10.htm">Joshua 15:10</a></div><div class="verse">And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which <i>is</i> Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Compassed</span>. Or, deflected (see ver. 4). This is in accordance with the view taken above. The border line which had run northwest from Jerusalem now bent backwards in a southwesterly direction, and followed the ridge towards Chesalon (see note on Chesalon). Mount Seir. Not the dwelling place of Esau, afterwards the country of the Edomites (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-3.htm">Genesis 32:3</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>), but a range running southwestward from Kirjath-jearim, part of which is still known as Sairah, or Saris, "auf welchem <span class="accented">Saris</span> und <span class="accented">Mihsir</span> liegen" (Kuobel). Since Kirjath-jearim means the "city of the forests," and Seir means "hairy," we may conjecture that the name was given to the ridge on account of its wooded character. This also is implied by "Mount Jearim." <span class="cmt_word">The side of Mount Jearim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">the shoulder</span> (see above, ver. 8). <span class="cmt_word">Which is Chesalon.</span> This is identified with <span class="accented">Kesia</span>, a point on the summit of the ridge stretching southwest from Kirjath-jearim. The fact that the border passed northward of Chesalon is a confirmation of the view taken above. We learn from <a href="../../par/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a> (cf. ver. 33 of this chapter), that the border passed by Zorah and Eshtaol in the Shephelah, through a neighbourhood described in Conder's Handbook as "an open corn country." <span class="cmt_word">Beth-shemesh.</span> The "house of the sun," identified with the modern Ain (or fountain of) Shems. It is called Irshemesh in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-41.htm">Joshua 19:41</a>. It was close to the border of the Philistines, and was the scene of the transactions recorded in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>. The propinquity to the Philistines appears to have affected the principles of its inhabitants, and their conduct contrasts most unfavourably with that of the inhabitants of Kirjath-jearim. This was the more disgraceful, in that Beth-shemesh (<a href="../../par/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) was a priestly city, and being inhabited by those whose "lips should keep knowledge," might have been expected to set a better example. It was required to furnish Solomon's household with provisions (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-9.htm">1 Kings 4:9</a>), it witnessed the defeat and capture of Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-11.htm">2 Kings 14:11-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-21.htm">2 Chronicles 25:21</a>) by Joash, king of Israel. It fell into the hands of the Philistines at the time of the decay of the Jewish power under Ahaz (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>). The name, like Baal-Gad and Ashtaroth-Karnaim, is worthy of remark, as pointing to the character of the early Phoenician worship. <span class="cmt_word">Timnah.</span> Sometimes called Timnath in Scripture (see <a href="../../par/judges/14-1.htm">Judges 14:1-6</a>), and Timnatha in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-43.htm">Joshua 19:43</a>.

This important Philistine city (see <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>) lay close to the northern border of Judah. As a matter of fact, however, the tribe of Judah never succeeded in permanently occupying this territory, which only fell under their yoke during the reigns of David and Solomon. The cities of the Philistines were, it is true, most of them captured (<a href="../../par/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>), but we soon find the Philistines once more in possession of them (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Northward</span>.

It has been argued from the variations that the one passage was not copied from the other, but that both were derived from a common document. No such conclusion, however, can be safely drawn from the text. For first, the present narrative deals exclusively with this portion of the history of Caleb. That in Judges, down to ver. 12, deals more generally with the subject, including the exploits of Caleb, under the general history of the progress of Judah. But from the time that the history becomes that of Caleb in particular, the agreement between the two narratives is verbal, including the very unusual word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e0;&#x5d7;</span>, with one or two most insignificant exceptions. Thus we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> interpolated in <a href="../../par/judges/1-13.htm">Judges 1:13</a>, and Othniel (or Kenez) is spoken of as the <span class="accented">younger</span> brother of Caleb. But unless we hold that it was a sacred duty of the writer in Judges to reproduce every single word of the narrative in Joshua, there is nothing whatever that can support the conclusion that the writer in Judges was not copying the earlier narrative. The variations are such as would naturally happen where a writer was transferring, a narrative to his pages with a desire to give the exact sense of the original without tying himself to every particular word. Since the use of inverted commas has been introduced we can find multitudes of instances where a writer, when professing to quote another accurately, has introduced far more variations into his quotation than are to be found here, where the writer, though quoting the Book of Joshua, and quoting it correctly, does not say that he is doing so. No one doubts that Jeremiah in ch. 48. is quoting <a href="../../par/isaiah/15.htm">Isaiah 15</a>, although the passages are not verbally coincident. We may safely regard this quotation of the Book of Joshua in that of Judges, as under all ordinary laws of criticism an evidence that the former book was in existence when the latter was written, just as the quotations of Deuteronomy in Joshua may naturally be taken as evidence that the Book of Deuteronomy was in existence when that of Joshua was composed. <span class="cmt_word">The son of Jephunneh.</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/14-6.htm">Joshua 14:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A part.</span> Literally, a <span class="accented">lot. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Among</span>.

The word Negeb signifies dry (see note on Negeb, <a href="../../par/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>). It must be remembered that it became the word for south, because the south of Palestine was an arid tract. Therefore Achsah must be understood as saying, "Thou hast given me a dry country, give me also a reservoir of water." The Vulgate translates Negeb twice over, "australem et arentem" (arentem only <a href="../../par/judges/1-15.htm">Judges 1:15</a>). The LXX. translates both Negeb and Gulloth as proper names.

Though the south country was in the main an arid region, yet its intersection by numerous wadys, with their attendant streams, provided fertile spots at intervals, where the traveller might rest, cattle might be watered, and corn and other produce raised. The only places of any importance in Scripture history mentioned here are Beersheba (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a>), and Hormah (see <a href="../../par/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/21-3.htm">Numbers 21:3</a>; and cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/12-14.htm">Joshua 12:14</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/19-4.htm">Joshua 19:4</a>; and <a href="../../par/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>).

These cities of the Philistines had, like Gibeon, daughter cities dependent on them, and must therefore have been, like Gibeon, "great cities as the royal cities" (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). They do not appear to have come under regal government till later times (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8, 11</a>, with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>). "Around it (Gezer) and along the sides were distributed a series of small isolated centres of agglomeration .... This disposition to scatter itself, of which Gezer surely does not offer us the only specimen, explains in a striking manner the Biblical phrase, 'the city and her daughters'" (Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1874). This explanation, however, is doubtful (see <a href="../../par/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>). According to Knobel, this passage cannot have been written by the Elohist, because he confines himself to the description of the cities the Israelites actually possessed. Why a lair writer, writing presumably when Israel's fortunes were at a lower ebb, should have added a description of the territory Israel <span class="accented">did not</span> possess, he does not explain.

Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 100) descants on the home-like character of the scenery and vegetation to an Englishman, and remarks on the contrast between the life, activity, and industry displayed there, as contrasted with the desolation of the greater part of Palestine. A later traveller, who would not, of course, be so struck with the resemblance to English scenery, speaks of the fertility of the ground as a matter of possibility, rather than of fact. The rocky soil, when broken up by the combined influences of heat, rain, and frost, is, like the soil of other rocky districts, extremely susceptible of cultivation when laid out in terraces. He remarks how the signs of ancient cultivation in this manner are to be seen on all sides, and laments the misrule which has converted the "land flowing with milk and honey" into a wilderness (see Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' ch. 19, and note on Joshua 10:40). The time has not yet come for the Jews, now asserting their ancient greatness in statesmanship, literature, and art in every country in the civilised world, to return to their own land. Not till then, it is to be feared, will the prophecy in <a href="../../par/isaiah/35.htm">Isaiah 35</a>. be fulfilled, and "the desert rejoice, and the wilderness blossom as the rose, while waters break out in the wilderness and streams in the desert, the parched ground becoming a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water."

"That long line of hills was the beginning of the 'hill country of Judaea,' and when we began to ascend it the first answer to our inquiries after the route told us that it was 'Carmel,' on which Nabal fed his flocks, and close below its long ranges was the hill and ruins of Ziph," close above the hill of Maon, Wilson also ('Lands of the Bible,' 1:380) makes the same remark. Maon is to be remembered as David's hiding place from the enmity of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24-26</a>), and as the home of Nabal (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>).

It has been identified with Teku'a, two hours south of Bethlehem. Of Bethlehem itself, the home of Ruth and David, the birthplace of Jesus Christ, it is unnecessary to speak. But the incidents related concerning Bethlehem in <a href="../../par/judges/17.htm">Judges 17, 19</a>. (which seem to indicate that the author of the book had special information about Bethlehem), as well as the narrative of the Book of Ruth, lead us to suppose that the verse inserted here by the LXX. is genuine, since Bethlehem was, in early times, a town of sufficient importance to be noticed in a list like this, and that its omission in the Hebrew text is due to the mistake of some transcriber.

It is described by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 197) as "a wilderness, but no desert." Herbage is to be found there, but no trees, no signs of the cultivation formerly bestowed upon the hill country (see above, ver. 48). And the fewness of the cities in early times is a proof that its character has not been altered by time. The hills, says Canon Tristram, are of a "peculiar desolate tameness," and are intersected by the traces of winter watercourses, seaming the sides of the monotonous round-topped hills. Other writers describe this country in less favourable terms, denying it even the scanty herbage found there by Canon Tristram.

"The cluster of camphire" (or rather of henna, the plant with which Oriental women stained their nails - <a href="../../par/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>) may still be found there, and its perennial torrent dashes still into the Dead Sea.

This spring, which rises amid the nebek trees and the wheat fields, "springs from the earth at the eastern base of a little knoll; the water is sweet, clear, and agreeable, neither cold nor warm" (Ritter). It flows, he adds, into a basin nine feet broad, in which many fish may be seen playing. This border coincides with the northern border of Benjamin (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-11.htm">Joshua 18:11-20</a>). Ritter mentions another spring, nearer to the Kuruntul or Quarantania range, and adds that, "under the wise management of an efficient government, and with the security of the district from the depredations of predatory savages, the oasis of Jericho might unquestionably resume the paradisaical aspect it once bore." <span class="cmt_word">To the wilderness.</span> Or, by or <span class="accented">along</span> the wilderness.

The Syriac renders, "up to the mountain which goeth unto Bethel;" but we must understand this of a range of mountains, and then we can identify the border with the double rocky ridge which stretches from the Mons quarantania, of which we have already heard (ch. 2.), and from the pool of Ain es Sultan, just mentioned, as far as Bethel.

The border of Joseph is very slightly traced out by the historian. It is difficult to give a reason for this fact, when we remember that Joseph, consisting as it did of the preponderating tribe of Ephraim, together with half the tribe of Manasseh, constituted by far the most important portion of Jewish territory. See, however, Introduction for the bearing of this fact on the authorship of the book. It is by no means easy to define the boundaries of the tribes; but, with the utmost deference to the authority of one so long engaged in the actual survey of the Holy Land as Mr. Conder, I feel unable to accept the maps he has given us in his 'Handbook' as an accurate account of them. Sometimes, perhaps, an eager attempt at the identification of certain places may lead astray those who are most familiar with their subject. But there are certain plain statements of the Book of Joshua which cannot be lightly set aside. Thus the extremity (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span>) of the border of Ephraim is distinctly stated in ver. 8 to be the sea. To translate "westward" would rob the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> of all meaning, even if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> had not the article. Thus Dan can only have approached towards Joppa, but cannot have reached it. And it will be observed in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>, in accordance with this view, that the outgoings of the Danite border are not said to have been the sea. Next, it would seem that the Ataroth of ver. 2 (not of ver. 7) and Ataroth-addar are either the same place or close together, and that the present verse gives a small portion of the southeastern boundary as far as Beth-horon. Why the boundary is not traced out further ("the author only gives the western part of the southern border, and leaves out the eastern," Knobel) we cannot tell, but the natural translation of ver. 6 is, "and the western border ran to Michmethah on the north" (so Knobel). There was so small a portion of Ephraim on the sea that the line of the Wady Kanah in a northeasterly direction to Michmethah, near Shechem, might be called a western, as it certainly was a northwestern, border. Then the border deflected (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) and ran in a southwesterly direction to Jericho. Manasseh seems to have been bounded by Asher on the north and Issachar on the east, from the borders of Asher to Michmethah, and its western boundary the sea from the Wady Kanah to the neighbourhood of Dor. It seems impossible, with the distinct statement that Dor was in Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) - it could hardly have been in Issachar - and that Carmel was part of its western border (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>), to thrust a wedge of Zehulun between Manasseh and Asher, as Mr. Conder has done. The invention of an Asherham-Michmethah must not be allowed to set aside the plain statement (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a>) that Manasseh impinged (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d2;&#x5e2;</span>) upon Asher in a northerly direction - that is, was bounded on the north by that tribe. Then, as Asher was the northern, so it would seem from the passage just cited that Issachar was, as has been suggested, the eastern boundary, and that Issachar was bounded by the Jordan eastward, Manasseh westward, and by Ephraim to the southwest, and some distance further south than is usually supposed. Yet <a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a> must not he forgotten in fixing the boundary of Issachar (see note on Joshua 19:17-23). Its northern border, comprehending Jezreel, and bounded by Tabor, was thrust in between Zebulun and Naphtali. Tabor was evidently the border of these three tribes. It is with much diffidence that I venture to offer these suggestions, but they appear to have the sanction of the plain statements of the sacred writer. It would seem as though the comparative smallness of the territory assigned to Joseph led to the cession of some of the towns northward of the Wady Kanah by Manasseh to Ephraim, Manasseh receiving compensation by receiving Beth-shean, Ibleam, Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo from Issachar and Asher. The possession of Beth-shean by Manasseh may be due to the fact that the boundary of Manasseh ran along the chain of mountains bordering the great plain of Esdraelon, until it almost reached the Jordan. Additional reasons for entertaining these opinions will be given in the following notes. <span class="cmt_word">On the east side was Ataroth-addar.</span> It is hardly possible to avoid the conclusion that a passage has been omitted here by the transcriber. If so, it must have been at a very early period, since the LXX. shows no sign of it, save that some copies add "and Gezer." But this is probably added from ver. 3, and is in no sense an <span class="accented">eastern</span> border. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the border went out towards the sea.</span> Or, "and the western border." <span class="cmt_word">On the north side.</span> Or, "northward." Apparently a line is drawn from the sea, which (ver. 3) is given as the termination of the southern boundary to Michmethah, near Shechem (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-7.htm">Joshua 17:7</a>). Knobel thinks that Michmethah (the signification of which is perhaps <span class="accented">hiding place</span>) was upon the watershed, and thus served as a dividing point. <span class="cmt_word">Went about.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">deflected.</span> The border ran m a northeasterly direction to Michmethah. It then bent back and ran in a southeasterly direction to Jericho. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/16-7.htm">Joshua 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ataroth</span>. Another Ataroth, on the <span class="accented">northern</span> border of Ephraim.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/16-8.htm">Joshua 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea.

Tappuah seems to have been near Mich-methah, and on the border (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-8.htm">Joshua 17:8</a>) of Manasseh. According to Knobel, Tappuah signifies <span class="accented">plain</span>, which is a little inconsistent with his idea that Michmethah, close by, was the watershed. Tappuah elsewhere signifies <span class="accented">apple.</span> Unto the river Trench. The winter-bound torrent Kanah, so named from its reeds and canes, formed the border between Ephraim and Manasseh. And the goings out (literally, <span class="accented">extremities</span>) thereof were at the sea This is the only possible interpretation of the passage, in spite of the obscurity caused by the same word being used for "sea" and "west." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/16-9.htm">Joshua 16:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim <i>were</i> among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - And the separate cities. Literally, <span class="accented">and the cities divided off.</span> The word "were," in our version, is misplaced. It should be read thus: "And there were cities divided off and assigned to the tribe of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh" (see note on ver. 5). This fact, together with the compensation given to Manasseh, may serve to explain the cohesion of the ten tribes in opposition to Judah. The boundaries of the latter tribe were more strictly defined, her attitude more exclusive. We may almost discern this in the prominence given to Judah in the present book. Ephraim, already enraged at the passing away of the pre-eminence from itself, which had not merely been predicted, but, as <a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1-3</a> and Judges 12:1 show, had been actually enjoyed, was closely allied to Manasseh, and Manasseh to Issachar and Zebulun, by the arrangement we are considering. It would naturally be able, by its position and these circumstances, to combine together the rest of the tribe against the somewhat overbearing attitude of the tribe of Judah (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-43.htm">2 Samuel 19:43</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/16-10.htm">Joshua 16:10</a></div><div class="verse">And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they drave not out.</span> The Ephraimites soon grew slack in the fulfilment of the Divine command. There is a distinction, apparently, between this passage and ch. 15:63. There the tribe of Judah was unable to drive out the Jebusites from their stronghold, and no mention is made of tribute. Here the Ephraimites seem deliberately to have preferred the easier task of reducing the Canaanites to tribute to the sterner and more difficult task of destroying them utterly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/15.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 15"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 15" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/17.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 17"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 17" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/17.htm"><title>Joshua 17 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/17.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/17.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/17-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/16.htm" title="Joshua 16">&#9668;</a> Joshua 17 <a href="../joshua/18.htm" title="Joshua 18">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/17-1.htm">Joshua 17:1</a></div><div class="verse">There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he <i>was</i> the firstborn of Joseph; <i>to wit</i>, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There was also a lot.</span> The preferable translation is, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">the lot for the tribe of Manasseh - for he was the firstborn of Joseph - was</span> (<span class="accented">or fell</span>) <span class="accented">to Machir the son of Manasseh.</span> That is to say, the proper possession of the tribe of Manasseh fell to Machir and his descendants only, because of their warlike spirit, and possibly on account of their numbers also.

Some have thought that this is simply the denominative of Asher, to distinguish it from the tribe, and that for "Asher to Michmethah" we should read "Asher-ham-Michmethah." But this could hardly be the Yasir above, since it is opposite Shechem. <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span>. Now Nablous. This place is famous both in the Old and the New Testament. We first read of it, under the name of Sichem, in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. It was the abode of Shechem and Hamor his son, when Jacob abode in Canaan after his return from Padan-aram. It was situated between Gerizim and Ebal, and became an important city in the days of the Judges (<a href="../../par/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>.). It was destroyed by Abimelech (<a href="../../par/judges/9-45.htm">Judges 9:45</a>), but it seems to have recovered. It was thither that Rehoboam went to be crowned, and there that his injudicious answer alienated forever the ten tribes from his rule. Jeroboam made it his capital and is said to have "built" it (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>). He afterwards, however, abandoned it for Penuel, and Penuel again apparently for Tirzah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-17.htm">1 Kings 14:17</a>), and Tirzah for Jezreel, which remained the capital until Omri built Samaria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It is no doubt the Sychar mentioned in St. <a href="../../par/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Most travelers have admired the picturesque situation of Shechem. It has even extorted a tribute from Dr. Peterman, in his 'Reisen im Orient,' a work which, however full of valuable information regarding the condition and customs of the people, does not abound m description of scenery. He becomes almost poetical as he speaks of this town, resting on the slopes of Gerizim, a mountain fruitful to its summit, and having opposite the bare, stony el Ebal, its outline unrelieved by verdure, the haunt of jackals, whose howls, like the cry of wailing children in distress, disturb the silence of the night. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 470) thus describes the scene: "A valley green with grass, grey with olives, gardens sloping down on each side, fresh springs rushing down in all directions; at the end a white town embosomed in all this verdure lodged between the two high mountains which extend on each side of the valley; this is the aspect of Nablous, the most beautiful, perhaps it might be said the only beautiful, spot in Central Palestine. Thirty-two springs can be traced in different parts. Here the bilbul delights to sit and sing, and thousands of other birds delight to swell the chorus."

The LXX. adds Jariel, translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> (these) by terebinth, and omits the word "cities." The cities southward of the brook belonged of course to Ephraim. But what is meant here is that Ephraim had cities <span class="accented">north</span> of the brook. That the border of Manasseh lay to the northward of the brook is asserted twice over in the latter part of this and the next verse. These cities of Ephraim are among (literally, <span class="accented">in the midst of</span>) the cities of Manasseh (see <a href="../../par/joshua/16-9.htm">Joshua 16:9</a>). If exact and minute accuracy is found in this record, how is it that accusations of inaccuracy are so readily made against its author, when his narrative is clearly very much abbreviated, and where a fuller knowledge of the facts might possibly clear up what now appears obscure? Our present text has not the names of these cities. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10</a></div><div class="verse">Southward <i>it was</i> Ephraim's, and northward <i>it was</i> Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they met together.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">they</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Manassites) <span class="accented">impinged</span> (this is the very same word as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "touched upon." There has been great discussion concerning this passage. The literal meaning is clearly that Manasseh was bordered by Asher on the north, and Issachar on the east. The idea of an Asher-ham-Michmethah must be given up if we take this rendering of the Hebrew. Its only justification is the fact that if Michmethah be at once the northern border of Ephraim and Manasseh, the territory of Manasseh is cut almost in half. And, in fact, such a supposition makes confusion worse confounded. Is it probable that in vers. 7 and 10 Asher-ham-Michmethah is meant; that the town Asher is mentioned in similar terms to the tribe Issachar in the latter verse; and that in ver. 11, without a single intimation of the change of meaning, the tribes Issachar and Asher are mentioned? Again: if Dor - considerably to the south of Mount Carmel - was within the territory of Asher (ver. 11), how can we possibly, as Conder's 'Handbook' does, place the limits of Asher at Accho, and bring Zebulun to the sea  (which it never reaches, for "toward the sea," in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-11.htm">Joshua 19:11</a> clearly means "westward"), interposing a large strip of territory between Manasseh and Asher, placing Dor, in spite of ver. 11, far within the limits of Manasseh, and giving this last tribe, or rather half tribe, an extraordinarily disproportioned share of the land? (See the complaint in ver. 16). Zebulun, too, was on the eastern border of Asher (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), and it is by no means certain that Shihor Libnath (see <a href="../../par/joshua/19-26.htm">Joshua 19:26</a>) is not the Wady Zerka, south of Dor. This is the view of Knobel, a commentator by no means void of acuteness. This contraction of Manasseh's territory explains why cities had to be given to it out of Asher and Issachar, as well as the complaint in the latter part of this chapter. Issachar, <span class="accented">too</span>, must have stretched considerably southward. But the vagueness of the description of Manasseh's border, especially on the north, prevents us from assigning any limits to Issachar in this direction; while it is impossible, with a writer in the Quarterly Papers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, to suppose that it extended from Jezreel and Shunem and Endor on the north as far as Jericho to the south.

It was a "noble city" in the days of Eusebius and Jerome. Many travellers have remarked on its splendid situation, "in this vast area of plain and mountains, in the midst of abundant waters and exuberant fertility" (Robinson, 'Later Bibl. Res.' sec. 7). "Just beyond, and separated by a narrow ridge, is another stream, also perennial, and on the peninsular formed by these two, with a bold, steep brow overlooking the Ghor, stood the citadel of ancient Beth-shean - a sort of Gibraltar on a small scale - of remarkable natural strength, and inaccessible to horsemen. No wonder that it was long ere Israel could wrest it from the Canaanites. The eastern face rises like a steep cone, most incorrectly stated by Robinson to be 'black, and apparently volcanic;' and by Porter, 'probably a crater.' Certainly there are many blocks of basalt lying about, but the hill is simply a limestone bluff." (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 501). He goes on, "How clearly the details of the sad end of Saul were recalled as we stood on this spot" (the summit of the cone). "There was the slope of Gilboa, on which his army was encamped before the battle. Round that hill he slunk by night, conscience stricken, to visit the witch of Endor. Hither, as being a Canaanitish fortress, the Philistines most naturally brought the trophies of the royal slain, and hung them up just by this wall. By the Yasir, and across that plain below us, the gallant men of Jabesh-Gilead hurried on their long night's march to stop the indignity offered to Israel, and to take down the bodies of their king and his sons." Jabesh-Gilead was not far off, and though in full view of the mountain, yet the men of Jabesh could creep along the Ghor by night and climb the steep face of the rock unsuspected by the warriors above; while the roar of the brook would drown all the sounds they might make (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' p. 454). <span class="cmt_word">And her towns.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">daughters</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> LXX.; <span class="accented">viculi</span>, Vulgate. Canon Tristram remarks how each hill in some parts of Palestine is crowned by a village, a number of which still cluster, as of old, round the chief city of the district. So in Italy we may see how times of unsettlement led to a similar policy. The fear of the northern pirates led to the planting the mediaeval towns on hills, and the disturbed state of the country kept them there till a comparatively late period. But many of them are deserted in this more peaceful age. Ibleam. Only known as near the place where Jehu gave Ahaziah his death blow. It was near Megiddo (see <a href="../../par/2_kings/9-27.htm">2 Kings 9:27</a>). Dor (see above <a href="../../par/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). Keil thinks that Dor and all the cities after it are in the accusative to "could not drive out" in the next verse. But it is more probable that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> was an anacolouthon. Vandevelde ('Travels,' 1:333) says that he did not wonder that the fainthearted Manassites shrank from attacking Dor when he saw its formidable position, ruder. This, the abode of the famous witch, still bears the old name. It is four miles south of Mount Tabor, in a country honeycombed with caves, and it stands on the shoulder of Little Hermon. The word signifies the "fount of Dor," or "the dwelling." Taanach. For this and Megiddo see <a href="../../par/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>. Three countries. Rather, three <span class="accented">hills</span>, or elevated spots (Napheth, see note, ch. 11:2). Gesenius compares the name Temont. The reference is to Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo. Keil suggests <span class="accented">province</span>, but he does not explain how a derivative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> can have this latter signification (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>. Beautiful for its height (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>) is Mount Zion). The LXX. and Vulgate regard it as a proper name, and translate, "the third part of Nopheth." They are puzzled by the expression here, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>.

They were proud of their numerical preponderance over the remaining tribes. Thus they, and they only, ventured to remonstrate with Joshua about the inadequacy of the portion allotted to them. Such a sensitiveness was likely to degenerate into insolence when the authority of the great leader was removed. And the history of Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1-3</a>) and of Jephthah (<a href="../../par/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a>) shows that this was actually the case. Here, again, we have a sign of that deep undercurrent of consistency which underlies our history, and is a guarantee of its authenticity. <span class="cmt_word">Seeing I am a great people.</span> The tribe of Joseph, at the census described in <a href="../../par/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, outnumbered every tribe but that of Judah. At the census in the plains of Moab (<a href="../../par/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>.) the tribe of Joseph outnumbered them all, though the relative proportions of Ephraim and Manasseh were altered, the latter being now considerably the larger of the two tribes. The whole number of the fighting men of Israel underwent a slight diminution during the passage through the wilderness. But the demand of the tribe of Joseph seems to have been a little unbecoming, since Joseph had obtained <span class="accented">two</span> lots and <span class="accented">two</span> portions, since half the tribe of Manasseh had settled on the east of Jordan. Hence no doubt the covert sarcasm of Joshua's reply, for, as Delitzsch shows, Judah, and even Dan, considerably outnumbered Ephraim and the half tribe of Manasseh. Part, however, of their complaint was no doubt caused by the idea that Joshua, as one of themselves, ought to have taken more care of the interests of his own tribe. Joshua, however, as a true servant of God ought to be, was above such petty considerations, though many who live under a higher dispensation find it impossible to emancipate themselves from such bondage. <span class="cmt_word">Forasmuch as the Lord hath blessed me hitherto.</span> Or, <span class="accented">hath blessed me to this extent</span> (but see <a href="../../par/exodus/7-16.htm">Exodus 7:16</a>). There is doubtless here an allusion to Jacob's blessing (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/44-22.htm">Genesis 44:22-26</a>), the fulfilment of which would naturally make a deep impression on the minds of the children of Joseph. Blessing was the word reiterated over and over again by the dying patriarch as he gazed upon the children of his best-beloved son. Here, again, we have one of those delicate touches, impossible to a writer of fiction, which show that we have here an authentic record of facts. No doubt the consciousness of the enthusiastic language of Jacob, reiterated upon an almost equally solemn occasion by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-17</a>), coupled with the obvious fulfilment of these predictions, led the tribe of Joseph to demand as a right the leadership in Israel, and no doubt predisposed the other tribes to concede it. The rivalry of Judah, to which reference has already been made, and which culminated in the sovereignty of David, was calculated to produce a beach which it required the utmost tact to heal. Pity it was that the Ephraimites and Manassites forgot the fact that the blessing was conditional, and neglected to lay to heart the terrible warnings in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. But it is too often so with men. They expect the fulfilment of prophecies which predict their aggrandisement, and too often strive themselves to hasten the hand of God, while the warnings of God's Word, since they are less pleasant to the natural man, are permitted to pass by unheeded (see vers. 12, 13, which was the first step on the downward road). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/17-15.htm">Joshua 17:15</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua answered them, If thou <i>be</i> a great people, <i>then</i> get thee up to the wood <i>country</i>, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou be a great people.</span> As though Joshua would say, "You are ready enough to boast, but unwilling to act.

Whether this be the "wood of Ephraim" mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6</a> has been much disputed. For not only David is related to have crossed the Jordan, but Absalom also, in hot pursuit of his father (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>). Neither army is mentioned as having recrossed the river; and it is a question whether it is more probable that there happened to be a "wood of Ephraim" on the other side of Jordan, or that Joab and Absalom, with their respective armies, recrossed Jordan without a word being said of the fact by the historian; the more especially as David (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-17, 31</a>) remained on the other side Jordan, while yet it was possible for the Ethiopian attendant, as well as Jonathan, to run to him with tidings of the defeat and death of Absalom. For the wood country in this neighbourhood cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/132-6.htm">Psalm 132:6</a>. Ewald would regard the language here as figurative, and the wood as referring to the powerful Phoenician tribes in the neighbourhood. He regards this answer as a sign of Joshua's "wit."

Jezreel abutted on the great plain of Esdraelon, a name which is but a corruption of Jezreel (see note on Joshua 19:18), where the chariots of iron could be used with effect, a thing impossible in the mountain districts. Hence the fact that the hill country of Palestine was more rapidly and permanently occupied than the plains (see Ewald, 'History,' 22 C., and Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' 2:328. Cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>, and note on Joshua 11:6). Here, once more, we have a proof that we have real history before us, and not a collection of poetic myths.

Yet, in spite of the encouragement given by Joshua, the children of Joseph did not drive the Canaanites out, as vers. 11-13 show. The only reason of this was that they did not trust in Gad, but preferred an unworthy compromise with neighbours who, however rich in warlike material, were sunk in sensuality and sloth. Keil would render "because" for "though," and regard the very fact of the strength of the Canaanites as the reason that the sons of Joseph would subdue them. But <a href="../../par/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a> supply us with other instances of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. in the sense of although, which certainly is the best sense here. "Let it be remembered how long it was before the Saxons were firmly established in Britain, the Islamite Arabs in Egypt. Israel could look for no reinforcements from kindred left behind. So much the worse might afterwards be the position of the nation, left alone without hope of kindred auxiliaries to meet the repeated outbreaks of the half-subdued Canaanites" (Ewald, 'Hist. Israel,' 2 2. c.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/18.htm"><title>Joshua 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/17.htm" title="Joshua 17">&#9668;</a> Joshua 18 <a href="../joshua/19.htm" title="Joshua 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span>. The word signifies a body of persons gathered together at a spot before indicated. The LXX. renders by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span>. The idea is evidently that of an assembly gathered together for some specific acts of worship. This passage teaches the duty of a national recognition of religion. Whatever evils there might be in Israel at that time, the absence of a general and formal acknowledgment of God was not one of them. When that public acknowledgment of Him ceased, the downfall of the nation was at hand. It was the absence of such acknowledgment that was the ruin of Israel, while the hypocritical and purely external recognition of God by Judah was equally offensive in God's sight. <span class="cmt_word">Assembled</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">was summoned</span>; by whom, we are not told. But this general gathering to set up the tabernacle was at once an act of due homage to Him by whose power they had done so many great deeds, and also the establishment of a centre of national life. As long as the worship of God was maintained in its purity, the unity of Israel would be preserved, in spite of the twelve-fold division into tribes, and without the need to introduce the monarchical power. When fidelity to the outward symbol of Israelitish unity, the tabernacle at Shiloh, relaxed, then dissension and weakness crept in, and Israel became a prey to her enemies. A remarkable instance of an opposite character meets us in the history of our own country. The prey of various unconnected Teutonic tribes, the island was one vast scene of anarchy and confusion, until the great Archbishop Theodore came over and founded a National Church. It was this religious unity and cooperation which tended to harmonise the conflicting forces in the land and steadily pioneered the way to an union of the rival tribes under one head. Without attempting to say whose fault it is that this religious unity is lost, or how it may best be reestablished, it surely is the duty of every patriot and every Christian to cooperate to the best of his ability and knowledge, with all the forces that he sees tending towards unity, and both pray and labour for the coming of the day when men may once more "with one mind and with one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ," and be willing to meet together "with one accord in one place." <span class="cmt_word">Shiloh</span>. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 14</a>, we find God prescribing that only in a place chosen by Himself shall the public worship of the congregation be paid to Him. Thither were all the males to resort three times a year. It is obvious how such a regulation tended to keep alive national feeling among the Israelites. The reason for the choice of Shiloh (which was probably made by Urim and Thummim, the case being important enough for such a decision) is to be found in its central position, five hours south of Shechem, and eight hours north of Jerusalem. Its situation is minutely described in <a href="../../par/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>. It is difficult to understand why; since Shiloh must have been well known to all the dwellers in Israel at that time, unless it was to explain to those who were not acquainted with the localities in the tribe of Benjamin the reason for the selection of Shiloh, namely, that it lay close by the road between Bethel and Shechem (see, however, note on Joshua 24:1). The place has been identified. It is the modern Seilun, but only a few ruins remain to mark the place once so famous in the history of Israel, where Eli abode, where Samuel spent his early years. Rejected by God Himself, as the Jewish Psalmist relates with patriotic pride (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60, 67-69</a>), it fell into utter neglect, and even in the days of Jeremiah it seems to have become a by word (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/26-6.htm">Jeremiah 26:6, 9</a>. Also Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Paper, Jan., 1873, where an account, with a plan, is given of the place in its present condition. There are a few rock-hewn tombs there). Whether it was named Shiloh on account of the word used in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>, it is impossible to say. The name appears to signify <span class="accented">rest</span>, and was an appropriate name to be given to the visible symbol of rest from warfare which Joshua had obtained for Israel (see <a href="../../par/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/22-4.htm">Joshua 22:4</a>). The difficult passage in <a href="../../par/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> is not of course included in this interpretation of the meaning of the word Shiloh. <span class="cmt_word">Congregation</span> The word here differs slightly from the word translated "congregation" in the first part of the verse, but it comes from the same root. <span class="cmt_word">And the land was subdued before them.</span> That is, the land in which the tabernacle was set up. We know from the next verse that the land as a whole was not subdued. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/18-2.htm">Joshua 18:2</a></div><div class="verse">And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance.</div><div class="comm">

The exhortation needs repeating to every generation, and not less to our own than any other, since the prevalence of an external decency and propriety blinds our eyes to the impiety and evil which still lurks amid us unsubdued. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/18-4.htm">Joshua 18:4</a></div><div class="verse">Give out from among you three men for <i>each</i> tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come <i>again</i> to me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Give out from among you.</span> Calvin enlarges much upon the boldness of these twenty-one men in venturing upon the task of the survey, rightly supposing that the difficulty of the task was enhanced by the number who undertook it (see note on Joshua 14:12). And here it is impossible to come to any other conclusion than that the twenty-one commissioners went together, for the object of their selection was to obviate complaints of a kind which, as we have already seen, the Israelites were not slow to make (see <a href="../../par/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14-18</a>). But the Israelites had inspired quite sufficient awe into the inhabitants of the land to make such a general survey by no means a difficult task. Nor is it probable that the commissioners were unprovided with an escort. <span class="cmt_word">Three men for each tribe.</span> Literally, for <span class="accented">the</span> tribe. This selection, which was intended to secure an impartial description of the country, would render impossible all future complaints, since the boundaries would be settled according to reports sent in by the representatives of each tribe.

That is to say, a written report was to be brought up in seven parts, a fair and equal division of the land having previously been agreed upon among the commissioners. This report having been accepted, division was afterwards made (ver. 10) by lot. Bishop Horsley and Houbigant here, as elsewhere, would rearrange the chapter, supposing it to have been accidentally transposed. But there seems no ground for the supposition. The repetition, with its additional particulars at each repetition, is quite in the style of the author (see ch. 2 and notes). <span class="cmt_word">That I may cast lots.</span> Or, <span class="accented">and I will</span> cast a lot.

The division was made <span class="accented">by cities.</span> These cities had been taken and destroyed by Joshua, and now it was the intention of the Israelites to be guided by the ancient political system of the country, to occupy those cities, and to cultivate the adjacent land, as the Phoenicians had done before them. Thus, not so much the area of the land, as the size and importance of its cities, was to be the leading principle of the division. And not unwisely. The Israelites were about to relinquish their nomad life, and if they settled in Palestine, how, without walled cities, could they hold their own against the powerful nations round about them? <span class="cmt_word">And came again to Joshua.</span> "The result of this examination, which was unquestionably a more careful one than that made by the spies of Moses, was that the unsubdued territory was found to be too small for the wants of seven tribes, while that apportioned to Judah was seen to be disproportionately large. To remedy this difficulty a place was found for Benjamin between Judah and Ephraim, and the portion of Simeon was taken out of the southern portion of Judah, while both Judah and Ephraim had to give up some cities to Dan" (Ritter).

Almost certainly the same as "Gibeah of Saul" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/11-4.htm">1 Samuel 11:4</a>).

It was near Saul's home, at the time his temporary refuge, that the Philistines encamped when Jonathan (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>.) made his daring attack on them. It was the scene of the terrible outrage recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. Lieut. Conder has identified it with Jeba, not far from Miehmash, situated on one of the branches of the precipitous Wady Suwaynit.

Only by narrow passes along deep torrent beds could access be obtained to this mountainous region. Thus it was that the otherwise inexplicable resistance to all Israel in arms, recorded in <a href="../../par/judges/20.htm">Judges 20, 21</a>, was maintained. In a country like this the skill of the Benjamites with the sling (<a href="../../par/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>) and the bow (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>) could be used with terrible effect upon foes powerless to come to a hand-to-hand conflict.

Simeon, at the last census (<a href="../../par/numbers/26-14.htm">Numbers 26:14</a>), was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, a fulfilment of the prophecy of Jacob, and possibly the result of the command given in <a href="../../par/numbers/25-5.htm">Numbers 25:5</a>, since the Simeonites were the chief offenders on that occasion (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-14.htm">Numbers 25:14</a>; see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/4-27.htm">1 Chronicles 4:27</a>). The distribution of territory was in accordance with this, and it is possible that the lot only determined the priority of choice among the tribes. The territory of Judah seems to have been recognised as too large, in spite of the importance of the tribe. They therefore willingly gave up a portion of their territory to the Simeonites.

On the other hand, Keil has remarked that in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-32.htm">Joshua 15:32</a> the number of names does not correspond to the whole number of cities given; and we have a Shema, probably a mistake for Sheba, in <a href="../../par/joshua/15-26.htm">Joshua 15:26</a>, mentioned before Moladah among the cities of Judah.

Dr. Pusey mentions a tribe still existing in the south, professing to be of the sons of Israel, and holding no connection with the Arabs of the neighbourhood, and supposes them to be the descendants of the five hundred Simeonites who took possession of Mount Seir in the days of Hezekiah. No border seems to have been given of Simeon.

This seems to have been a middle point, from which the border is traced eastward and westward, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>, and perhaps in ver. 32.

Knobel, however, says that if the Kishon had been meant it would have been called by its name, and that we must therefore understand the Wady-el-Mil'h. But this is by no means a safe conclusion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-12.htm">Joshua 19:12</a></div><div class="verse">And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Chisloth-Tabor.</span> The loins or flanks of Tabor. Tabor (the name signifies either quarry - see note on Shebarim, probably a kindred word, <a href="../../par/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a> - or navel), is one of the most conspicuous mountains of Palestine. Like Soracte, above the Campagna of Rome, "the cone-shaped figure of Tabor can be seen on all sides," though it rises only 1,750 feet (French) above the level of the sea, 800 above the plain at its northeastern base, and 600 above Nazareth on the north-west (Ritter, 2:311). Chisloth-Tabor was on the northwest side of the base of Tabor. Tabor has been supposed to have been the scene of the Transfiguration. But Ritter points out that from the time of Antiochus the Great, 200 years before Christ, to the destruction of Jerusalem, the summit of Tabor was a fortress. And he notices that while Jerome and Cyril mention this tradition, Eusebius, who lived 100 years earlier, knows nothing of it.

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e1;&#x5d1;</span> is here used transitively. The meaning is that the border makes a curve round the city of Neah. Neah seems to have been the extreme eastern border. Methoar is supposed to be the Pual participle, and has been freely translated, "which is marked out," or, "which belongs to," Neah. But the passage is obscure. Knobel could alter the reading, in view of the grammatical difficulty. Yet this, perhaps, is not insuperable in view of <a href="../../par/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14</a> (see Gesen, 'Grammar,' sec. 108, 2. c.). <span class="cmt_word">Valley</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>.

This name, signifying the "house of bread," would naturally enough be given to a place in a fertile situation. We are not to suppose that it was "Bethlehem-Ephratah, among the thousands of Jadah" (<a href="../../par/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). It is now Beit-lahm, about eight miles in a westerly direction from Nazareth.

Possibly the fact that the "lines" of this tribe had "fallen in pleasant places," had tended to induce sloth. Certain it is that we hear but little of this tribe in the after history of Israel. They were not, like Reuben, absent from the great battle of Tabor, for there we read that, like Issachar, they "jeoparded their lives unto the death" for their homes and liberties. Yet though they seem thenceforth to have slackened in their zeal, theirs was a fair portion. It bordered on the slopes of Tabor, and seems (though the fact is not mentioned here) to have extended to the Sea of Galilee, as we may gather from <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-17.htm">Joshua 19:17</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.</div><div class="comm">

The valley (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>) of Jezreel, known in later Greek as the plain of Esdrsela or Esdraclon (Judith 1:8 Judith 7:2; 2 Macc. 12:49) was "the perennial battlefield of Palestine from that time to the present" (Cooper, 'Egyptian Obelisks,' p. 33). Lieut. Conder ('Quart. Paper, Pal. Expl. Fund,' Jan., 1873), however, takes exception to this statement. "The great battles of Joshua," he says, "were fought far to the south." We presume he would make an exception on behalf of the action by the waters of Merom, and that he does not wish us to forget that the majority of Joshua's other "battles" were sieges. "David's wars were fought with the Philistines," he continues, "while the invasions of the Syrians were directed to the neighbourhood of Samaria." But here, again, he would seem to have forgotten <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>, <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-26.htm">1 Kings 20:26</a>, <a href="../../par/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>, 25, while he expressly admits that the great battles of Gilboa and Megiddo, in which Saul and Josiah were defeated and met their deaths, were fought here. And we have already seen that twice did the Egyptians invade Syria by this plain. One of these invasions took place while Moses was in Egypt, under Thothmes III. The other was the famous expedition of Rameses II. against Syria, about the time of Deborah and Barak. If we add to these the victory of Gideon over the Midianites and the overthrow of Sisera, we shall have reason to think that the epithet "the battlefield of Palestine" applied to this plain is not altogether misplaced, especially if, with a large number of critics, we regard the Book of Judith as founded on fact, but relating to events of some other time than that of Nebuchadnezzar. "Well may it be fertile," exclaims Mr. Bartlett ('From Egypt to Palestine,' p. 478), "for it has drunk the blood of the Midianite, the Philistine, the Jew, the Roman, the Babylonian, the Egyptian, the Frenchman, the Englishman, the Saracen, and the Turk. It is a singular group to summon up to the imagination, Gideon, Saul, and Jonathan, Deborah, Barak, and Sisera, Ahab, Jezebel, Jehu, Josiah, Omri, and Azariah, Holofernes and Judith, Vespasian and Josephus, Saladin and the Knights Templar, Bonaparte and Kleber." The list is a striking one. But certain it is that the plains of Jezreel have been noted as the highway of every conqueror who wished to make the fertile fields of Palestine his own. The Israelitish invasion alone seems to have been decided elsewhere than on that plain, stretching as it does from the foot of Carmel in a southeasterly direction, and divided in the direction of Jordan by Mount Gilboa and Little Hermon into three distinct branches, in the midst of the southernmost and most extensive of which stands the famous city of Jezreel - God's acre, or sowing ground, as the name indicates. Here Barak and Deborah fell upon the hosts of Jabin (<a href="../../par/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>), descending suddenly from the heights of Tabor with 10,000 men upon the vast and evidently undisciplined host that lay in the plain. Here Gideon encountered the vast host of the Midianites (<a href="../../par/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a>), who, after laying waste the south country, finally encamped in this fertile plain (accurately called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;</span>in <a href="../../par/judges/6-38.htm">Judges 6:38</a>), and with their leaders Oreb and Zeeb, and their princes Zebah and Zalmunna, were swept away in one of those sudden and irrational panics so often fatal to Eastern armies. Here Saul, hard by Jezreel, dispirited by his visit to the witch of Endor, on the north of Gilboa, gathered his men together as a forlorn hope, to await the attack of the Philistines, their numbers at first swelled by a number of Israelites whom Saul's tyranny and oppression had driven into exile (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/29.htm">1 Samuel 29</a>). Advancing to Jezreel, the Philistine host carried all before them, and drove the Israelites in headlong flight up the steeps of Gilboa, where Saul and his sons fell fighting bravely to the last (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/30.htm">1 Samuel 30</a>.). In the later and sadder days of the Israelitish monarchy, when the ten tribes had been carried into captivity by the Assyrian conqueror, Josiah courted disaster by a rash onslaught upon the Egyptian troops as they marched against Assyria. No details of this fight at Megiddo are preserved, save the fatal fire of the Egyptian archers, who marked Josiah as their victim, and drove, no doubt, his leaderless troops from the field (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-22.htm">2 Chronicles 35:22</a>). At Jezreel, too, Ahab made his capital. Hither Elijah, when "the hand of the Lord was upon him" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-46.htm">1 Kings 18:46</a>), ran after the wondrous scene on Mount Carmel, when he alone, in a strength not his own, withstood the "prophets of Baal, even four hundred and fifty men." Here Jehoram stood on the hill, with its commanding view, watching with an uneasy distrust the furious rush of Jehu with his troop from the other side Jordan, and here, in the plat of Naboth the Jezreelite, so fatal to Ahab and his house, did the vengeance decreed overtake the unhappy monarch (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>), The spot may be still identified. It is the modern Zerin. Ritter describes it (and so does Robinson) as standing on the edge of a precipice 100 feet high, and commanding a fine view of the plain of Beth-shean on the east, and of Esdraelon on the west. There is a tower here which commands the same view as the watchmen of Jehoram commanded, bearing witness to the accuracy of the historian. So in <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>, the mention of Taanach, Megiddo, and the region of Beth-shean, as <span class="accented">beneath</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5b7;&#x5e5;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>). Jezreel is another instance of topographical detail which marks the correctness of the record. Another point is that we read in the narrative above mentioned of "chariots." Wilson ('Lands of the Bible,' 2:303) was surprised, on leaving the rugged heights of the hill country, to find how easily, if the civilisation of Palestine permitted, excellent roads might be made throughout this region; and Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 421) has remarked on the desolate appearance now presented by that fertile region, the result of the insecurity for life and property which is so commonly remarked by all who have travelled in the East. Here, where under a better rule would be the abode of peace and plenty, no cultivator of the land dare venture to pass the night, exposed to the depredations of the wild tribes that infest the country. Only a mountain fastness, hard to climb and comparatively easy to defend, affords a secure retreat for those who would live peaceably in that once favoured land. Shunem. Now Sulem: the place of the encampment of the Philistines before they "pitched in Aphek" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-4.htm">1 Samuel 28:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>). It was "five Roman miles south of Mount Tabor" (Vandevelde) and an hour and a half (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> about six miles) north of Jezreel (Keil and Delitzsch). Here Abishag the Shunammite lived (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-3.htm">1 Kings 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-17.htm">1 Kings 2:17, 21</a>), and here Elisha lodged, and afterwards restored the son of his entertainers to life (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4, 8</a>.).

For we read (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-10.htm">Joshua 17:10, 11</a>) that Asher met Manasseh on the north, whence we conclude that it must have cut off Issachar from the sea, and that as Dor was among the towns which Manasseh held within the territory of Issachar and Asher, it must therefore have been within the boundaries of the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Shihor-libnath.</span> For Shihor see <a href="../../par/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. Libnath, which signifies white or shining, has been supposed by some to mean <span class="accented">the glassy river</span>, from its calm, unbroken flow, though this appears improbable, since Shihor means turbid. It is far more probable that the current was rendered turbid by a quantity of chalk or limestone which it carried along in its course, and hence the name "muddy white." Keil thinks it to be the Nahr-el-Zerka, or crocodile river, of Pliny, in which Beland, Von Raumer, Knobel, and Rosenmuller agree with him. But when he proceeds to argue that this river, being blue, "might answer both to <span class="accented">shihor</span>, black, and <span class="accented">libnath</span>, white," he takes a flight in which it is impossible to follow him. Gesenius, from the glazed appearance of burnt brick or tiles (<span class="accented">l'banah</span>), conjectures,that it may be the Belus, or "glass river," so called, however, in ancient times because the fine sand on its banks enabled the manufacture of glass to be carried on here. But this, emptying itself into the sea near Acre, has been thought to be too far north. Vandevelde, however, one of the latest authorities, as well as Mr. Conder, is inclined to agree with Gesenius. The difficulty of this identification consists in the fact that <span class="accented">Carmel</span> and <span class="accented">Dor</span> (<a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>) are said to have been in Asher (see note on Joshua 17:10). The Nahr-el-Zerka has not been found by recent explorers to contain crocodiles, but it has been thought possible that they have hitherto eluded observation. Kenrick, however ('Phoenicia,' p. 24), thinks that as <span class="accented">crocodilus</span> originally meant a lizard, the <span class="accented">lacertus Niloticus</span> is meant, the river being, in his opinion, too shallow in summa to be the haunt of the crocodile proper (see also Tristram, 'Land of Israel.' p. 103, who believes it possible that the crocodile may be found there, though no specimen has as yet been produced). The Zerkais described in Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Paper, January, 1874, as "a torpid stream flowing through fetid marshes, in which reeds, canes, and the stunted papyrus grow." When it is added, "and where alone in Palestine the crocodile is found," no evidence is given in favour of the statement. It empties itself into the sea between Dor and Caesarea, a few miles north of the latter.

But the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> here and <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in <a href="../../par/joshua/21-30.htm">Joshua 21:30</a>. The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;</span> are so much alike that there is no doubt that the mistake has arisen earlier than the time when that translation was made. It is true that the lists of Levitical cities in <a href="../../par/joshua/21.htm">Joshua 21</a>. and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6.htm">1 Chronicles 6</a>. do not entirely correspond. But the resemblance here between the names is too striking to allow of the supposition that two different cities are meant. Great Zidon. This city, as well as Tyro, remained unsubdued, although assigned by Joshua to Asher. The boundary of Asher appears to have been traced first towards the west, then eastward, from a middle point on the southern border (see note on ver. 11), then to have been carried northward from the same point (the <span class="accented">left hand</span> usually means the north; see note on Teman, <a href="../../par/joshua/15-1.htm">Joshua 15:1</a>), on the east side till it reached Cabul. Then the northern border is traced westward to Sidon. Then the border turned southward along the sea, which is not mentioned, because it would seem to be sufficiently defined by the mention of Ramah and Tyre. Between Hosah and Achzib there would seem to have been a greater paucity of cities, and therefore the sea is mentioned. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-29.htm">Joshua 19:29</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>then</i> the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The strong city Tyre.</span> Rather, the <span class="accented">fortified</span> city. The general impression among commentators appears to be that the island city of Tyre, afterwards so famous, had not as yet come into existence. And the word here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> seems to be more in accordance with the idea of a land fortress than of one so exceptionally protected as an island fortress would be. This expression, like "great Zidon" above, implies the comparative antiquity of the Book of Joshua. The island city of Tyre, so famous in later history, was not yet founded. The city on the mainland (called Ancient Tyre by the historians) was "the chief seat of the population till the wars of the Assyrian monarchs against Phoenicia" (Kenrick, 'Phoenicia,' p. 344). He adds, "The situation of Palae-Tyrus was one of the most fertile spots on the coast of Phoenicia. The plain, is here about five miles wide; the soft is dark, and the variety of its productions excited the wonder of the Crusaders." William of Tyre, the historian of the Crusades, tells us that, although the territory was scanty in extent, "exiguitatem suam multa redimit ubertate." The position of Tyre, as a city of vast commercial importance and artistic skill in the time of David and Solomon, is clear enough from the sacred records. It appears still (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-6.htm">2 Samuel 24:6, 7</a>) to have been on the mainland, for the successors of Rameses II., up to the time of Sheshonk, or Shishak, were unwarlike monarchs, and the Assyrian power had not yet attained its subsequent formidable dimensions. We meet with Eth-baal, or Itho-baal, in later Scripture history, remarkable as the murderer of the last of Hiram's descendants, and the father of the infamous Jezebel, from which we may conclude that a great moral and therefore political declension had taken place since the days of Hiram. The later history of Tyre may be inferred from the prophetic denunciations, intermingled with descriptive passages, found in <a href="../../par/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>, and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26.htm">Ezekiel 26, 27</a>; Joel (Joel 3:3-8) and Amos (Amos 1:9) had previously complained of the way in which the children of Israel had become the merchandise of Tyre, and had threatened the vengeance of God. But the minute and powerful description in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27.htm">Ezekiel 27</a>, shows that Tyre was still great and prosperous. She was strong enough to resist the attacks of successive Assyrian monarchs. Shalmaneser's victorious expedition (so Alexander tells us) was driven back from the island fortress of Tyre. Sennacherib, in his vainglorious boast of the cities he has conquered (<a href="../../par/isaiah/36.htm">Isaiah 36, 37</a>.), makes no mention of Tyre. Even Nebuchadnezzar, though he took and destroyed Palae-Tyrus, appears to have been baffled in his attempt to reduce the island city. Shorn of much of its ancient glory, Tyre still remained powerful, and only succumbed, after a resistance of seven months, to the splendid military genius of Alexander the Great. But Alexander refounded Tyre, and its position and its commercial reputation secured for it a large part of its former importance. The city continued to flourish, even though Phoenicia was for a long period the battleground between the Syrian and the Egyptian monarchies. To Christian readers, the description by Eusebius of the splendid church erected at Tyre by its Bishop Paulinus will have an interest. He describes it as by far the finest in all Phoenicia, and appends the sermon he preached on the occasion. Even in the fourth century after Christ, St. Jerome ('Comm. ad Ezekiel,' 26:7.) wonders why the prophecy concerning Tyre has never been fulfilled. "Quod sequitur, 'nee aedificaberis ultra,' videtur facere quaestionem quomodo non sit aedificata, quam hodie cernimus nobilissimam et pulcherrimam civitatem." But the present state of Tyre warns us not to be too hasty in pronouncing any Scripture prophecy to have failed. Even Sidon is not the wretched collection of huts and ruined columns which is all that remains of the once proud city Tyre. <span class="cmt_word">And the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">and the western extremity is from Hebel to Achzib.</span> Hebel signifies a region or possession, as in ver. 9.

Keil and Delitzsch make the journey a three hours' one. But Manndrell, who also corroborates St. Jerome in the distance (nine Roman miles), states that he performed the journey hence to Acre in two hours.

The natural advantages of the territory must have been great. Not only was it described prophetically by Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-20.htm">Genesis 49:20</a>) and by Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-24.htm">Deuteronomy 33:24, 25</a>), but the prosperity of the two great maritime cities of Tyro and Sidon was due to the immense commercial advantages the neighbourhood afforded. St. Jean d'Acre, within the territory once assigned to Asher, has inherited the prosperity, so far as anything under the Turkish rule can be prosperous, once enjoyed by her two predecessors. Maundrell, the acute English chaplain at Aleppo, who visited Palestine in 1696, describes the plain of Acre in his day as about six hours' journey from north to south, and two from west to east; as being well watered, and possessing "everything else that might render it both pleasant and fruitful. But," he adds, "this delicious plain is now almost desolate, being suffered, for want of culture, to run up to rank weeds, as high as our horses' backs." Asher, however, never employed the advantages its situation offered. They never subdued the Canaanites around them, but, unquestionably at a very early date (see <a href="../../par/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>) preferred a life of compromise and ignoble ease to the national welfare. But it would be incorrect to suppose that because the tribe is omitted in the list of rulers given in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>, it had ceased to be a power in Israel. For Gad is also omitted in that list, while among the warriors who came to greet David when he became undisputed king of Israel, Asher sent 40,000 trained warriors, a number exceeding the men of Ephraim, and those of Simeon, of Dan, and of the half tribe of Manasseh (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12.htm">1 Chronicles 12</a>.), and far exceeding the numbers of Benjamin, which had never recovered the war of almost extermination waged against it, in consequence of the atrocity at Gibeah (<a href="../../par/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>.). Possibly the reason why so few are mentioned of the tribe of Judah on that occasion is because so many were already with David. There seems no ground for the idea of Dean Stanley, that the allusion to Asher in <a href="../../par/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a> is any more contemptuous than the allusion to any other tribe.

It has been supposed to lie northwest of Lake Huleh, the ancient Merom, whence we find that the scene of that famous battle was assigned to the tribe of Naphtali. The border of Naphtali is more lightly traced than any previous one, and is regarded as being sufficiently defined, save toward the north, by the boundaries of the other tribes.

We have it here clearly stated that Naphtali was bordered on the south by Zebulun, on the west by Asher, and on the east by "Judah upon Jordan." To Judah. These words have caused great trouble to translators and expositors for 2,000 years. The LXX. omits them altogether, rendering, "and the Jordan to the eastward." The Masorites, by inserting a disjunctive accent between them and the words that follow, would have us render, "and to Judah: Jordan towards the sun rising," or, "is towards the sunrising," a rendering which gives no reasonable sense. They unquestionably form part of the text, since no version but the LXX. omits them. A suggestion of Von Raumer's has found favour that the cities called Havoth Jair, which were on the eastern side of Jordan, opposite the inheritance of Naphtali, are meant. Jair was a descendant of Judah by the father's side, through Hezron. So Ritter, 4:338 (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21-23</a>). It would seem that the principle of female inheritance, having once been admitted in the tribe of Manasseh, was found capable of further extension. But to the majority of the Israelites this settlement would no doubt be regarded as an offshoot of the tribe of Judah.

Naphtali sent a goodly number of warriors to welcome David as "king over all Israel" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-34.htm">1 Chronicles 12:34</a>). The inheritance of Naphtali was in the main fertile, but there was a large mountain district, known as the mountain region of Naphtali (<a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). Some of the mountains rose to the height of more than 3,000 feet.

The LXX. and Vulgate have Joppa here, and it is unfortunate that our translators, in this instance only, should have adhered to the Hebrew form. Joppa appears to have been an important city in the time of the Maccabees (see 1 Macc. 10:75, 76; and 2 Macc. 4:21). Its mention in the New Testament as the place where St. Peter's vision occurred will be known to all. The name signifies "beauty," though Joppa does not seem to be distinguished above all other places in Palestine by the beauty of its situation. But according to Hovers, Japho signifies in Phoenician, "high place." It is certainly built on a range of terraces above the sea, but the term "high place" would seem unsuitable. The soil is very productive, and it is "the only harbour in Central Palestine" (Ritter). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a></div><div class="verse">And the coast of the children of Dan went out <i>too little</i> for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went out too little for them.</span> The Hebrew is, went out <span class="accented">from them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either went out beyond their own borders, or went out too small a distance to be sufficient for them. The first is the explanation of Masius ("extra se migrasse"), the second of Jarchi. Houbigant suggests for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> "and it went out" <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;</span> "and it was narrow." But the LXX, has the same reading as ourselves, and the explanation given above is quite consistent with the fact. The border of Dan did "go out" far beyond the borders originally assigned to the tribe, in fact to the extreme northern limit of Palestine. The account of the taking of Laish, or Leshem, is given more fully in <a href="../../par/judges/18.htm">Judges 18</a>. The inheritance assigned to Dan was extremely small, but it was also extremely fertile. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-48.htm">Joshua 19:48</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 48.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the inheritance of the children of Dan.</span> We read little of Dan in the after history of Israel.

It was only when his work was done, and Israel had received her allotted territory, that Joshua thought it right to take his own inheritance. Calvin remarks that it was "a striking proof of the moderation of this servant of God" that he "thought not of his own interest until that of the community was secured." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a></div><div class="verse">According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, <i>even</i> Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The city which he asked.</span> He asked for a city, certainly. But the law of the inheritance was not to be set aside for him any more than for the meanest in Israel. Timnath-serah was in his own tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Timnath-serah.</span> Called Thamna by Josephus and the LXX., and Timnath-heres, or Tinmath <span class="accented">of the sun</span> by a transposition of the letters, in <a href="../../par/judges/2-9.htm">Judges 2:9</a>. Rabbi Solomon Jarchi gives a singular reason for the latter name. It came to be so called because there was a representation of the sun upon the tomb of him who caused the sun to stand still. Timnath-serah must not be confounded with Timnah, or Timnathah, in the tribe of Dan (ver. 48). For a long time its site was unknown, but within the last 40 years it has been identified with Tibneh, seven hours north of Jerusalem, among the mountains of Ephraim. Dr. Eli Smith was the first to suggest this, and though it was doubted by Robinson, it has since been accepted by Vandevelde and other high authorities. Tibneh seems to have anciently been a considerable town. It is described in Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine' as a gentle hill, crowned with extensive ruins. Opposite these, on the slope of a much higher eminence, are excavations like what are called the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem. Jewish tradition, however, points to Kefr Haris, some distance south of Shechem, as the site of Joshua's tomb, and several able writers have advocated its claims in the papers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, on the ground that on such a point Jewish tradition was not likely to be mistaken. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a></div><div class="verse">These <i>are</i> the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 51.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> The lots were drawn under Divine sanction. The ruler of the State and the ruler of the Church combined in this sacred act, hallowed by all the rites of religion, and confirmed by the presence and approbation of the heads or representatives of all the tribes. Accordingly, as has been said above, we hear of no murmurings or disputings afterwards. However much the Israelites may have quarrelled among themselves, there is not a hint of dissatisfaction with the final distribution of territory. Three points may be noticed here - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The authenticity of the narrative is confirmed by these evidences of the internal agreement of its parts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> We learn the value of mutual consultation, of open and fair dealing, from this narrative. The parcelling out of the inheritance of Israel under God's command was carried out in such a manner as to preclude the slightest suspicion of partiality. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The duty of hallowing all important actions with the sanctions of religion, of uniting prayer and a public recognition of God's authority with every event of moment, whether in the life of the individual or of the body politic, finds an illustration here. An age which, like the present, is disposed to relegate to the closet all recognition of God's authority, which rushes into wars without God's blessing, celebrates national or local ceremonials without acknowledging Him, contracts matrimony without publicly seeking His blessing, receives children from Him without caring to dedicate them formally to His service, can hardly plead that it is acting in the spirit of the Divine Scriptures. A well known writer in our age declares that we have "forgotten God." Though the external and formal recognition of Him may be consistent with much forgetfulness in the heart, yet the absence of such recognition is not likely to make us remember Him, nor can it be pleaded as proof that we do so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/18.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 18"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 18" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/20.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 20"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 20" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/1.htm"><title>Joshua 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../deuteronomy/34.htm" title="Deuteronomy 34">&#9668;</a> Joshua 1 <a href="../joshua/2.htm" title="Joshua 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now after the death of Moses</span>. The form of the Hebrew is the usual historical one for the continuation of a narrative before commenced. The Book of Joshua is thus shown to be, and to be intended to be, a continuation of the Book of Deuteronomy, which ends with the death of Moses (see Speaker's Commentary <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). This link of connection is lost in the English version. The question forces itself upon the critic, At what time was this consecutive narrative written, as is admitted, in various styles, in the language of obviously distinct periods - first composed and palmed off upon the Jews as the genuine work of a writer contemporary, or nearly contemporary, with the events he describes? <span class="cmt_word">The servant of the Lord.</span> This term (Keil) is applied to the heavens and the earth (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-91.htm">Psalm 119:91</a>), to the angels (<a href="../../par/job/4-18.htm">Job 4:18</a>), to the prophets (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>, etc.), to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to the Jewish people (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>), to Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>), and even to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, etc.), as the appointed minister of God's wrath, and to pious men in general (Gesenius; see Psalm 34:23, etc.). It is also applied to the Messiah (<a href="../../par/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>; comp. the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> similarly applied in <a href="../../par/acts/4-27.htm">Acts 4:27</a>). It originally implies the position of a <span class="accented">slave</span>, whether born in the house or bought with money (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39</a>; and <a href="../../par/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3, 14</a>). In all cases it expresses a closer and more familiar relation than the term <span class="accented">minister</span> below. Keil says that it is applied so frequently to Moses that it has become almost his "official title" (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>, and the Book of Joshua <span class="accented">passim</span>, and cf. <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>). It is, however, still more frequently applied to David. But it suits well with the special and peculiar mission which Moses had above the rest of mankind. He was, as it were, the household servant of the Most High, His steward and representative, ruling over the family of God in His name, and giving to them the directions of which they stood in need. <span class="cmt_word">That the Lord spake unto Joshua.</span> Either by <span class="accented">Urim and Thummin</span>, which seems at least probable (see <a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>, and <a href="../../par/joshua/9-14.htm">Joshua 9:14</a>). But the great majority of commentators prefer the idea of an inward revelation, since the words are frequently used in this Book of God's revelations to Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>, etc.). The manner of these inward revelations is also a matter on which much difference of opinion exists. They, no doubt, were frequently made through a vision or dream, as to Abraham at Sodom (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>), Jacob at Bethel, and Joshua him. self (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13</a>). But it is by no means clear that they were <span class="accented">always</span> so. The voice of God in answer to prayer is recognised by Christians in a strong inward persuasion of the desirability or necessity of a particular course. Of this kind would seem to be the answer to St. Paul's prayer in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>. And it is quite possible that in passages such as <a href="../../par/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, 22:1, 2, nothing more is meant than that the persuasion, by God's permission or inspiration, was strongly felt within. And so it is possible that one so specially and divinely commissioned as Joshua discerned in a strong and apparently irresistible conviction, the voice of God (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-17.htm">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>). <span class="accented">Joshua's</span> name was originally <span class="accented">Hoshea</span> (like the prophet and the Israelitish king of that name). The name originally meant <span class="accented">salvation</span>, or <span class="accented">deliverance</span>, but it was changed, either when he entered into Moses' service, or when he was about to fight the Amalekites (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-44.htm">Deuteronomy 32:44</a>), into Jehoshua, or Joshua (either "God shall save," or "God's salvation"). It is not stated in Holy Writ <span class="accented">when</span> the name Joshua was given. In <a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>, where Joshua is named for the first time, he is called by the name Moses gave him, and is mentioned incidentally as a person well known to the writer and his readers. The reader need hardly be reminded that in the form Jeshua (Gr. <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>) it was the name of our Blessed Lord Himself, and that the Name which is now above all other names is used of Joshua in two places in the New Testament, in <a href="../../par/acts/7-45.htm">Acts 7:45</a>, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>. It was a common name in later times, as <a href="../../par/colossians/4-11.htm">Colossians 4:11</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a> will serve to show. In later Hebrew, as in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>, Joshua is called Jeshua, and the names of Joshua and Jeshua are given indiscriminately to the high priest, the son of Josedeeh, who was contemporary with the building of the second temple. For Joshua as a type of Christ the reader may consult a deep passage in 'Pearson on the Creed,' Art. II., from which some of the most striking parts are here quoted: - "First, it was he alone, of all which passed out of Egypt, who was designed to lead the children of Israel into Canaan, which land, as it is a type of heaven, so is the person which brought the Israelites into that place of rest a type of Him who only can bring us into the presence of God, and there prepare our mansions for us. Besides, it is further observable, not only what Joshua did, but what Moses could not do. The hand of Moses and Aaron brought them out of Egypt, but left them in the wilderness. Joshua, the successor, only could effect that in which Moses failed. Moses must die that Joshua may succeed (<a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20-22</a>). The command of circumcision was not given to Moses, but to Joshua; nor were the Israelites circumcised in the wilderness under the conduct of Moses and Aaron, but in the land of Canaan under their successor. Which speaketh Jesus to be the true circumciser, the author of another circumcision than that of the flesh (<a href="../../par/romans/2-29.htm">Romans 2:29</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>). If we look on Joshua as the 'minister of Moses,' he is even in that a type of Christ, 'the minister of the circumcision for the truth of God.' If we look on him as the successor of Moses, in that he represented Jesus, inasmuch as 'the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.' If we look on him as judge and ruler of Israel, there is scarce an action which is not predictive of our Saviour. He begins his office at the banks of Jordan, where Christ was baptized and enters upon the public exercise of His prophetical office; he chooseth there twelve men out of the people to carry twelve stones over with them, as our Jesus thence began to choose His twelve apostles, those foundation stones in the Church of God (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-14.htm">Revelation 21:14</a>). Joshua smote the Amalekites and subdued the Canaanites, By the first making way to enter the land, by the second giving possession of it. And Jesus in like manner goeth in and out before us against our spiritual enemies, subduing sin and Satan, and so opening and clearing our way to heaven; destroying the last enemy, death, and so giving us possession of eternal life." Pearson quotes Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Theodoret, and others as justifying his view of the history. Theodoret, moreover, in his 'Questions on Joshua,' remarks on the coincidence between <a href="../../par/joshua/1-17.htm">Joshua 1:17</a> and <a href="../../par/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>. And Origen, in his first 'Homily on Joshua,' remarks on the fact that the first time the sacred name meets us in the Book of God, it is as the leader of an army (<a href="../../par/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9</a>). Another way in which Joshua was a type of Christ is this. Under Moses there are constant murmurings and disputings, for "the law made nothing perfect" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/7-19.htm">Hebrews 7:19</a>). Under Joshua all is confidence and triumph, for "by one offering Jesus hath perfected forever them that are sanctified" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/10-14.htm">Hebrews 10:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Moses' minister.</span> This word is principally used of service in the house of God.

Some commentators have suggested the word <span class="accented">aide de camp</span>, but this would be equally incorrect in the opposite direction, since Joshua's services (see <a href="../../par/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>) were clearly not rendered only in time of war.

The word fitly describes the headlong current of the river, which, according to Mr. Macgregor ('Rob Roy on the Jordan,' p. 282), has a fall of fifteen feet per mile, and if we subtract the Lake of Gennesareth and the lake and attendant marshes of Huleh, of thirty feet. Between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea, however, the average fall is much less. Just after leaving the Sea of Galilee its fall is over forty feet. (Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 216). It may be interesting to compare with this the average inclination of some of our own English rivers. The swiftest is the Dee, in Aberdeenshire, which has a fall of 16.5 ft. per mile. The Tweed and Clyde have a fall of 16 ft. and 14 ft. respectively, while the Severn has but 26.5 in., the Thames 18 in., and the Shannon 9 in. per mile. This comparative table will give the best idea of the rapidity of the Jordan. The various explorers bear testimony to the swiftness of its current. Thus Robinson, in his 'Biblical Researches,' says, "The current was so strong that even Komeh, a stout swimmer of the Nile, was carried down several yards in crossing." "It was so swift," says Dr. Bartlett ('Egypt and Palestine,' p. 452), "that a gentleman of another company, who went to bathe, was not suffered by his friends to do so without a rope most un-romantically attached to his person." This was in March, at the time of the overflowing (see chap. 3.), and he adds, "the turbid stream rushed along like a mill ace." Canon Tristram, visiting it in April, describes it as "rushing with tremendous force." It rises among the snows of Hermon, dashes down headlong into the lake Huleh, the Merom of the Book of Joshua, and thence, with a descent of 60 ft. per mile, into the Sea of Galilee. Thence it shapes its course, as we have seen, with greatly diminished velocity into that strange depression where the Dead Sea lies, at a level of 1,290 ft. beneath the level of the Mediterranean. <span class="cmt_word">I do give,</span> literally, <span class="accented">I am giving</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at this moment, when you are preparing to enter it.

The conquest was intended to be complete. Not a foot's breadth was to rest in the hands of its former owners. But here, as elsewhere in Holy Writ, we may mark the way in which man's sin and want of faith has marred the purposes of God. In the Book of Judges we read that the Canaanites were not only not driven out, but that the children of Israel made marriages with them, worshipped their gods, and practised their abominations. Jerusalem remained in the hands of the Jebusites until the time of David, while the Philistines remained in possession of their portion of Palestine until it was reduced under the power of the king of Babylon. We may observe that, according to all the ordinary laws of criticism, this citation of Deuteronomy is a proof that that Book existed when the Book of Joshua was written. For the cumbrous scheme of Elohists, Jehovists, Deuteronomists, and the like, by which this natural conclusion is overruled, see Introduction. Have I given it. The preterite here denotes God's purpose (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/1-29.htm">Genesis 1:29</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the wilderness and this Lebanon.</span> The words suppose a line to be drawn from the desert of Arabia on the south and the range of Lebanon on the north, to the River Euphrates on the one hand and the Mediterranean Sea on the other, including the land of the Hittites (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-26.htm">2 Chronicles 9:26</a>). Tiphsah, the later Thapsacus, was far north of the utmost limits of Palestine, and almost in the latitude of Antioch. Azzah is generally termed Gaza in our version. See note on Joshua 11:22. The land of the Hittites here (Keil) seems to be taken for the land of Canaan in general (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-3.htm">Ezekiel 16:3</a>), but extending far beyond their border, and including Syria, Moab, Ammon, the land of Bashan, and part of Arabia. This was never actually in the hand of the Israelites save during the reigns of David and Solomon, when these regions were either tributary to them, or had been actually reduced under their immediate sway. "The promise," says Theodoret, "was not undefined, but if ye shall keep my commandments and ordinances" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22, 23</a>). But they, inasmuch as they immediately transgressed the law, did not obtain the perfect promises. The Divine Apostles, on the contrary, not only conquered those places on which they set their foot, but even those in which their all wise writings were read; and the land that was before a desert they displayed as a Divine Paradise." <span class="cmt_word">This Lebanon.</span> This expression is no doubt used because Lebanon was visible from the spot where Joshua was standing. There is nothing surprising in this. We learn from travellers that its range, which there is no doubt included that of Anti-Lebanon, with its lofty peak Hermon, the highest point in Palestine, is visible from all parts of the Holy Land, even from the depths of the Jordan valley near the Dead Sea. Dr. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p, 2) says that it is visible from Cyprus. Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 609) tells how he had seen Hermon from Type, Sidon, Carmel, Gerizim, from the neighbourhood of Jerusalem, from Gilead, from Nebo, and from the Dead Sea. The name Lebanon, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> to be white, like the Arabic <span class="accented">lebanon</span>, milk, is supposed by Robinson to have been given from the whitish colour of the chalk or limestone rock (so Conder, 'Handbook,' p. 206). But it is at least equally probable that it derives its name, like Mont Blanc in Savoy, from its snowy peaks. Hermon is still called by the Arabs Jebel-el-Thelj, or "the snowy peak." The Jordan, the river of Palestine <span class="accented">par excellence</span>, derived its copious and ever-flowing streams, so essential in that "thirsty land," from the Anti-Lebanon range. "Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus," as well as the Orontes, and the Litany or Leontes, derive their waters from the same source (see Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' chap. 25; Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 172, 173). We have a vivid description of the region of Lebanon and the adjacent range of Anti-Lebanon and Hermon, in the spring, at the time of the melting of the snows, in the 42nd Psalm. There David, recalling to mind his sojourn in the "land of the Jordan," and of Hermon, speaks of the "deep calling unto deep," of the noise of the cataracts as they dashed from rock to rock and foamed along the mountain sides; and he describes his sorrows as overwhelming him by their number and magnitude, just as the multitudinous torrents that rose in that snowy region threatened to engulf the unwary traveller in their onward sweep. The far-famed cedars of Lebanon are indigenous to this region, and to it alone, but the climatic changes which Palestine has undergone have reduced their number largely, and comparatively few specimens now remain, in a wild condition, of that noble tree, once the pride of the dwellers in the land. "We cannot study all the passages in the Old Testament which refer to the cedar, without feeling certain that in ancient times it was a far more conspicuous feature in the landscape than it is now" (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 631). <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates.</span> <span class="accented">Das grosse Wasser Phrath</span> (Luther). The Hebrew name is as Luther gives it. The Greeks added the euphonic syllable at the commencement, according to those who assign to the word a Semitic derivation. Others, however, derive it from an Aryan source, and regard it as equivalent to "the flowing river." This mighty stream, especially after its junction with the Tigris, far transcended in size any other with which the Israelites were acquainted. The plains of Mesopotamia, even as far as Nineveh and Babylon, were destined to have been occupied by the Jewish race, had not their impiety and rebellion prevented; and the world empire obtained by Nineveh and Babylon might, and had they been obedient would, have been theirs. <span class="cmt_word">All the land of the Hittites.</span> The Hittites, or Chittites, seem to have been the most considerable of the tribes which inhabited Canaan. We find them in possession of Hebron in the time of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>.), but their more usual dwelling place was in the valley. They appear from the narrative above quoted to have been a peaceable people. We have records of them in Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions. Thus we hear of the Khita in the inscriptions of Rameses II., who reigned between 1383 and 1322, B.C.; that is, about the time of Deborah and Barak ('Records of the Past,' 2:67-78; 4:25-32). They were the inhabitants, however, of a region further to the northward, beyond the borders of the Holy Land, on the banks of the Orontes. So a Mohar, or scribe, of Rameses II., in an account of a tour in Palestine, in which he mentions Kirjath Anab, Achsaph, Megiddo, and the land of Hamath, describes Khita as to the north, bordering on this latter territory ('Records of the Past,' 2:106). The various translators of the Assyrian inscriptions of Assur-bani-pal, Tiglath Pileser, Shalmaneser, and Sennacherib recognise the Hittites in the people mentioned as dwelling to the north of Palestine (<span class="accented">ibid</span>. 3:52; 5:21, 32, 33; 7:61), though Ewald thinks that the Khatta there mentioned must be sought still further north. Prof. Sayce, in a recent lecture, regards the Hittites as having occupied a large portion of Asia Minor, and as having had great influence upon early Greek art, and adds, "Till within the last few years the Bible alone has preserved the name of a people who must have had almost as great an influence on human history as Assyria or Egypt." Shalmaneser mentions the kings of the Hittites, just as they are mentioned in the later narratives of Kings and Chronicles (see note on Joshua 3:10). Unto the great sea. As the Euphrates was the greatest river, the Mediterranean was the greatest sea, known to the Jews. Unlike the race they displaced, the Canaanites - or, to call them by a title by which they are better known to profane history, the Phoenicians - the Jews were no sailors. It may have been even before the conquest of Canaan under Joshua that the Phoenician fleets sailed out beyond the pillars of Hercules, and brought back tin from the British isles. For Canaan, or Phoenicia, was a powerful and civilised country when conquered by the Jews. But whether it were before this period that Britain was discovered, or whether the fleets of Tyre and Sidon first sailed thither at a later period, to the Jews the Mediterranean still remained the great sea. They knew nothing of the vaster ocean into which it flowed. It seems strange that, with the example of Tyre and Sidon before them, the Israelites should have been so indifferent to navigation. Even in the time of David, it was Hiram's ships that brought him his treasures and building materials. The later navies of Solomon and Jehoshaphat did but coast along the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to Ophir, which has been identified with India, or more probably with Arabia. <p> CHAPTER 1:5-9.

There was a "book of the law" in Joshua's time, according to this early testimony, and we may conclude from vers. 3-7 that Deuteronomy formed a part of it (see also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-19.htm">Deuteronomy 17:19</a> for a similar precept.

Different ideas have been entertained of their duties. Keil, Jahn (<span class="accented">Hebrew Commonwealth</span>), and others believe that they were genealogists; but it seems more probable that their original duties were to keep processes and minutes, and that, like our Indian "writers" and the "Master of the Rolls" at home, they exercised some kind of judicial functions, with which, moreover, active duties were sometimes combined. The idea that they were genealogists is contrary, as Gesenius shows, to the context in many places. Thus in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6-19</a>, they seem to have had to see that the specified tale of bricks was delivered up; and we know from the recently deciphered Egyptian inscriptions that very accurate registers of such matters were kept. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/23-2.htm">Joshua 23:2</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, etc.) they appear to have exercised judicial functions in connection with the <span class="accented">"princes"</span> (not <span class="accented">"captains,"</span> as in our version, which would lead to the idea that they were military officers). In <a href="../../par/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> they are connected with the elders. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/26-29.htm">1 Chronicles 26:29</a> they seem again to have exercised judicial functions, whereas in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a> their duty appears to have been to keep the muster rolls. In <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-7.htm">Proverbs 6:7</a> we find them once more with active duties as in the text. The LXX. equivalent; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, is rendered in <a href="../../par/acts/19-35.htm">Acts 19:35</a> by "town clerk," an officer with active as well as merely secretarial duties. Here they seem to have acted as officers of the commissariat, civil and military functions being naturally largely interchangeable in the then condition of the Israelitish people, just as they were in the early days of our Indian empire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prepare you victuals.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">game</span>, the term being applied to meat obtained by hunting. Thus it is applied by Isaac to Esau's venison in <a href="../../par/genesis/27.htm">Genesis 27</a>. Here it means <span class="accented">food of any kind</span>, but especially animal food. It is therefore obvious that the miraculous supply of manna was soon to cease (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/5-12.htm">Joshua 5:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Within three days.</span> Much difficulty has been created here by the fact that another three days are mentioned in chap. 3:2 as elapsing after the return of the spies, which has been supposed to have taken place between this command and the period then mentioned. Three more days were spent (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-22.htm">Joshua 2:22</a>) by the spies in eluding the pursuit of the men of Jericho - one day in going thither, and one more in returning to Moses. Consequently eight days, if not more (see <a href="../../par/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7</a>), must have elapsed between this proclamation and the actual crossing of the Jordan. But when we remember that the Hebrew language possesses no pluperfect tense, that there are many instances, such as (very probably) <a href="../../par/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, and more certainly <a href="../../par/genesis/3-1.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/20-18.htm">Genesis 20:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18, 32</a>, where the Hebrew narrative has clearly departed from the chronological order, and that the chronology is obscured by this chasm in the Hebrew linguistic system, we may suppose that the narrative in the second chapter is parenthetical, and relates to events which occurred before the occasion now spoken cf. This is the view taken by Josephus and the Rabbis, and our translators have adopted it in the margin - a proceeding which, as their preface shows, may frequently be held to imply that in their opinion it is the preferable interpretation. It is energetically impugned by Keil, who maintains that there are insuperable difficulties in the way of this arrangement. He does not, however, make out a very powerful case against the simple explanation of Cornelius a Lapide, that the spies left the camp on the 3rd Nisan, returned on the 6th, that Joshua gave his order on the 7th, and that on the 10th (<a href="../../par/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) the crossing was effected. Stripped of all verbiage, Keil's argument appears to amount simply to this, that it was not likely that the account of the narrative would be thus interrupted by an account of a transaction out of its proper chronological order. It may be added that it seems doubtful whether we must not render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> in ver. 12, by the pluperfect, for it seems very probable that the word of command to the two tribes and a half who had obtained their inheritance beyond Jordan had been given before this, and that therefore it may have preceded the command given to the spies, in which case one of Keil's chief objections fails to the ground. Other explanations than that of Cornelius a Lapide have been suggested. Thus Kimchi supposes that the spies left on the 5th Nisan and returned on the 8th; while Masius supposes that they were sent out simultaneously with these orders. Augustine's explanation, that Joshua did not speak by revelation, but was influenced by human hope, is noticeable, as proving that the early fathers did not always take the strictest view of inspiration.

We have here a remarkable instance of undesigned agreement between the various books of the Old Testament: one of those signs of the genuineness of the narrative which would be almost impossible to a compiler of fictitious records. We are told in the passage just cited that the reason why these particular tribes desired an inheritance on the other side Jordan was because they were particularly rich in cattle. Now we learn from other passages that this region was - and travellers tell us that it is to this day - a region particularly suited for pasture. The 'Jewish Chronicle,' in December, 1879, mentions a scheme projected by Mr. Laurence Oliphant for colonising this district for agricultural purposes under the auspices of a company. The "fat bulls of Bashan" were almost proverbial in Scripture. Mesha, king of Moab, was a "sheep master," we read (<a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>), and his tribute, rendered in sheep to the king of Israel, was a very large one; especially when we remember that Moab was at that time but little larger than an ordinary English country (see also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/39-18.htm">Ezekiel 39:18</a>). The land to the east of Jordan bore the name Mishor, or level land, as contrasted with the rocky region on the other side of Jordan.

In the first cited of these passages it has given rise to much discussion among those whose studies have been confined to the text of the English Bible, excluding even the margin.

The former refers to the parallel passage in <a href="../../par/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17</a>, where for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> we find <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5e1;</span> <span class="accented">quick.</span> The first interpretation is rendered probable by <a href="../../par/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>, where the order of march is described as a fivefold order, and by the similarity of the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> five, and is not excluded by <a href="../../par/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>, where the army, though disorganised, may have still been arranged in its fivefold divisions. The fact that there is an Arabic word, almost precisely similar, which is applied to the fivefold division of an army, makes it almost certain that this is the true meaning. But some scholars prefer to render it "brave," or "eager for war" (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> <a href="../../par/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>).

But we read in <a href="../../par/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a> that 40,000 only of them went over. Above 70,000 must have remained behind to guard their women, children,and flocks, a precaution both reasonable and necessary. So indispensable, in fact, was it, that in this apparent discrepancy we may find one of the strongest proofs of the genuineness of our narrative. For, as Calvin remarks, in a country not yet pacified, all the women and children would infallibly have been massacred had they been left unprotected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 1:16-18.

Obedience is easy when all goes well with us, and when it makes no demand upon our faith. The Israelites murmured when the promise was as yet unfulfilled. They rebelled against God when obedience entailed serf sacrifice. But now all was hope and eagerness.

Here, again, Joshua is represented as aware of the existence of the Pentateuch. It must, therefore, have existed in something like its present shape when the Book of Joshua was written.

Knobel notices that the first of these expressions is found in <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>, and the second in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">Deuteronomy 4:42</a>. The latter is "superfluous," and therefore a "filling up of the Deuteronomist." The "Deuteronomist" must have been very active in his "filling up." If he were really so lynx-eyed in a matter of style, it is a wonder that he was so careless, as we are told he is, in matters of fact. To more ordinary minds it would seem as if the author, familiar with the books of Moses, was quoting Deuteronomy for the precept, and Leviticus for the nature of the offence. <span class="cmt_word">The avenger of blood.</span> The Hebrew word is worthy of notice. It is Goel; that is, literally, <span class="accented">redeemer</span>, one who buys back at the appointed price what has fallen into other hands, as a farm, a field, a slave, or anything consecrated to God. Hence, since the duly of such redemption, on the death of the owner, devolved upon the nearest relative, it came to mean "blood relation." Thus Boaz (<a href="../../par/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1, 6, 8</a>) is called the Goel of Elimelech and his widow. In the present passage, the phrase "the redeemer (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> next of kin) of the blood" signifies the exactor of the only penalty which can satisfy justice, namely, the death of the murderer. So we are taught in <a href="../../par/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-17.htm">Leviticus 24:17, 21</a>. This duty, which in civilised society belongs to the government, in uncivilised tribes is usually left to the relatives of the murdered man. Hence the terrible blood feuds which have raged between families for generations, and which are not only to be found among savage nations, but even in countries which lay claim to civilisation. In Ireland, for instance, it is not so long ago since one of these blood feuds in the county Tipperary had acquired such formidable proportions that the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church there were compelled to resort to a mission in order to put an end to it. A man had been killed nearly a century before in an affray which commenced about the age of a colt. His relatives felt bound to avenge the murder, and their vengeance was again deemed to require fresh vengeance, until faction fights between the "Three-Year-Olds" and the "Four-Year-Olds" had grown almost into petty wars. A thrilling story written by the late Prosper Merimee turns upon the Corsican <span class="accented">vendetta</span>, and so true is this story to life that in the very year (1879) in which these words were written an occurrence precisely similar, save in its termination, was reported in the daily journals to have taken place in that island. The only way in which the feud could be terminated was by summoning the representatives of the two families before the authorities and exacting an oath from them that they would cease their strife. It is no small corroboration of the Divine origin of the Mosaic law that we find here a provision for mitigating the evils of this rude code, and for at least delivering the accidental homicide from the penalty of this law of retaliation. Yet for the offence of wilful murder the penalties enjoined by the Jewish law were terribly severe. A deliberate violation of the sanctity of human life was an offence for which no palliation could be pleaded. No right of sanctuary was to be granted to him who had wantonly slain a fellow creature. "No satisfaction" was to be taken for his life (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>). "The land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, save by the blood of him that shed it" (ver. 33). Such provisions might be expected of a lawgiver who had laid down as the fundamental principle of humanity that man was created "in the image of God," after His likeness; that God had "breathed the breath of life" into him, and man had thus "become a living soul" (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). Such inward harmony is there between Moses' inspired revelations concerning God's purpose in creation, and the precepts he was commanded to deliver to the children of Israel.

The former was not designed to save the criminal from the penalty he had deserved, but only the victim of an accident from consequences far exceeding the offence. The Greeks and Romans, on the contrary, provided the real criminal with a mode of escape from a punishment which he had justly merited. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, <i>and</i> until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Until he stand before the congregation.</span> That is, until he had had a fair trial.

This is clear from <a href="../../par/numbers/35-24.htm">Numbers 35:24, 25</a>. Why the period of the death of the high priest should have been fixed upon is not easy to explain. Keil thinks it is because the death of the high priest was typical of the death of Christ, and refers to <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14, 15</a>. But the reference is not to the point. The high priest's death was in no sense typical of the death of Christ. His yearly entrance into the holy place once a year, on the Day of Atonement, was so typical. It might have been supposed that this yearly atonement would have been regarded as a propitiation for all the sins committed during the year. Certainly the fact that the high priest died the common death of all men, and the inauguration of his successor to fill his place could in no way be regarded as an atonement for sin. There is more force in Bahr's suggestion in his 'Symbolik' (2:52). The high priest, on this view, is the head of the theocracy, the representative of the covenant. He concentrates in his person (so Bahr puts it in another place - see vol. 2:13) the whole people of Israel in their religious aspect. His death, therefore, stands in a connection with the life of Israel which that of no other man could do. "It is," says Maimonides ('Moreh Nevochim,' 3.40), "the death of the most honoured and beloved man in all Israel. His death plunges the whole community into such distress that private sorrow is lost in the general affliction." Thus the covenant in a way recommences with the inauguration of the new high priest. Bahr complains that Philo has carried this view to an extravagant and fanciful extent. Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' vol. 2, sec. 3, p. 258) takes the same view as Maimonides, that the high priest's death was "a great calamity," affecting the whole nation.

It is not likely that in the later times of Jewish history, when the law had been forgotten (<a href="../../par/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>) and its precepts had long been in abeyance, that the institution of the city of refuge remained in full force. But we find three cities selected on each side of Jordan. Those on the west were in the tribe of Naphtali on the north, of Ephraim in the centre, and of Judah in the south. The same is the case with those on the other side Jordan. Thus every little detail of the narrative, when closely scrutinised, does but show more entirely how free this narrative is from the reproach so hastily cast upon it of being a loose and inaccurate compilation, attempted by a man who had not the slightest literary fitness for the task he had undertaken. A corroboration of this view may be found in the fact that all these cities were Levitical cities. Thus, as the crime of homicide was looked upon under the Mosaic law as a crime apart from all other crimes, inasmuch as it was an offence against the life which was God's gift, and man, who was God's image, so the offender who pleaded extenuating circumstances for his offence was placed, until his trial could be held, under the special protection of the Divine law. For "the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and men should seek the law at his mouth." It was the special privilege of the tribe of Levi to possess the "key of knowledge." It was to them that the duty of ascertaining the wilt of God by Urim and Thummim was assigned (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>). Thus a special acquaintance with the law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>), and a special fitness for deciding the difficult questions sometimes arising out of it, would naturally be found in the elders of those cities which had been set apart as cities of refuge. <span class="cmt_word">In Galilee.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Hag-Galil</span>, the circle. Here we have the masculine, as in Joshua 13:2; 17:17; 22:10, 11, the feminine form. This is the first place in Scripture in which the word Galil, or Galilee, is applied to this region. Gesenius regards it as having been originally a district of twenty towns round Kedesh in Naphtali. Such a region of twenty towns is mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11</a> (see also Isaiah 8:23; or, Isaiah 9:1 in our version). Kedesh has already been noticed (see also <a href="../../par/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/20-8.htm">Joshua 20:8</a></div><div class="verse">And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By Jericho eastward.</span> Or, eastward of Jericho.

Our version, by its renderings, obscures the beautiful precision with which our historian never fails to hit off the physical geography of the country. Thus, the plain of Bashan, Gilead, and Reuben is always the Mishor; the strip of land between the mountains and the Mediterranean is always the Shephelah; the depression of the Jordan Valley and the country south of the Dead Sea is invariably the Arabah; wide plains shut in between ranges of hills or situated on their slopes are distinguished by the title of Emek; while narrow waterless ravines are known by the name of Ge. We may quote here the emphatic words with which Canon Tristram concludes his 'Land of Israel,' "While on matters of science the inspired writers speak in the ordinary language of their times (the only language which could have been understood), I can bear testimony to the minute truth of innumerable incidental allusions in Holy Writ to the facts of nature, of climate, of geographical position - corroborations of Scripture which, though trifling in themselves, reach to minute details that prove the writers to have lived when and where they are asserted to have lived; which attest their scrupulous accuracy in recording what they saw and observed around them; and which, therefore, must increase our confidence in their veracity, where we cannot have the like means of testing it. I can find no discrepancies between their geographical or physical statements and the evidence of present facts. I can find no standpoint here for the keenest advocate against the full inspiration of the scriptural record. The Holy Land not only elucidates but bears witness to the truth of the Holy Book." <span class="cmt_word">Ramoth in Gilead.</span> See <a href="../../par/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>, where it is called Ramoth Mizpeh; also <a href="../../par/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>. All these cities of refuge were Levitical cities. It is famous as the headquarters of Jehu's rebellion, in which he clearly had the support of the priestly party (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9</a>.). The key to his subsequent conduct is found in this fact. His "zeal for the Lord," displayed so ostentatiously to Jonadab, who we may suppose, as being of the "family of the scribes," to have become identified with the Levites (cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a> with <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>, and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-32.htm">1 Chronicles 27:32</a> with <a href="../../par/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="../../par/jeremiah/8-8.htm">Jeremiah 8:8</a>), was simply a stroke of policy, to bind to his interest the sacerdotal party, to whom,with the army, he owed his throne. Just such a policy commended itself to the worldly wisdom of our own Lancastrian princes, and led to the enactment of the infamous statute de <span class="accented">heretico comburendo in</span> the fifteenth century. Jehu, we find, was contented with the one vast sacrifice of idolaters, for whom he cared nothing, and gave himself no further trouble to secure purity of worship for his people. The one great value of the geographical and political details in the book of Joshua is that when carefully studied they supply us with the key to many a mystery in the after history of Israel, which, but for their aid, we should scarcely have unravelled.

Such a supposition is little in keeping with the devout spirit of him who now directed the affairs of the Israelites, who had been minister to Moses the Levite, and had but lately been concerned with Eleazar, the high priest, in making a public recognition of that God to whose service the Levites had been specially set apart. The delay in appointing to the Levites their cities arose from the nature of the arrangement which had to be made for the Levitical cities. The prophecy which threatened (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>) to "scatter them in Israel" was to be fulfilled for the benefit of the whole people. Instead of a portion for himself, Levi, as we have been repeatedly informed (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-33.htm">Joshua 13:33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>), was to have "the Lord God of Israel for his inheritance." Since, therefore, their cities were to be assigned them within the limits of the other tribes, it was impossible to apportion them until the other tribes had been provided for. <span class="cmt_word">Unto Eleazar the priest.</span> The close connection between the military and the sacerdotal power is kept up throughout the book. Warned by his one act of neglect in the case of the Gibeonites, Joshua never again appears to have neglected to have recourse to the high priest, that he might ask counsel of God for him, as had been prescribed in <a href="../../par/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>. Eleazar is placed first here, because, as the acknowledged head of the tribe, he was the proper person to prefer its request to the leader. But the whole history shows how entirely Joshua and Eleazar acted in concert. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Joshua the son of Nun.</span> In a matter of ecclesiastical organisation the ecclesiastical took precedence of the civil leader. <span class="cmt_word">And unto the heads.</span> The position of Joshua was that of a chief magistrate ruling by constitutional methods. The representatives of the tribes were invariably consulted in all matters of moment. Such appear to have been the original constitution of all early communities, whether Aryan or Semitic. We find it in existence among Homer's heroes. It meets us in the early history of Germanic peoples. It took a form precisely analogous to the Jewish in the old English Witan where the chief men in Church and State took counsel with the monarch on all matters affecting the commonweal of the realm; and the remains of this aristocratic system still meet us in our own House of Lords. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/21-2.htm">Joshua 21:2</a></div><div class="verse">And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At Shiloh.</span> Another instance of exact accuracy. Shiloh was now the place of assembly in Israel (see <a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord commanded.</span> The command is given in <a href="../../par/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>. We have here, therefore, another quotation from the books of Moses. If we refer to it we find how exactly the precepts were carried out. First, the six cities of refuge were to be appointed, and then forty-two more were to be added to them. Calvin, not noticing this, has complained that this narrative is not in its proper place, and that it should have been inserted before the details in ch. 20. The very reverse is the fact. These cities of refuge are included, in what follows, among the number of forty-eight cities in all, assigned to the Levites. <span class="cmt_word">Suburbs</span>. See <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>. And so throughout the chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/21-3.htm">Joshua 21:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Out of their inheritance.</span> Out of that of Israel (see note on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">These cities.</span> The number was forty-eight, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, four times twelve. Bahr ('Symbolik des Alten Testaments,' 1:221) remarks on the symbolical meaning of this number. He compares it, first, to the twelve tribes marching in four detachments, the ark of God and its guard in the centre (see <a href="../../par/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>.). Four, he says, is the number of the world, and three the sign of God, and twelve of the combination of the two. Thus we are reminded of the heavenly city which "lieth four-square," which has "twelve foundations of precious stones," "twelve gates of pearls, and at the gates twelve angels," and the names of "the twelve tribes of Israel" written thereupon, and wherein was "the tree of life," with its "twelve manner of fruits," which were "yielded every month" (<a href="../../par/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12, 14, 16, 19, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/21-4.htm">Joshua 21:4</a></div><div class="verse">And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, <i>which were</i> of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the lot came out.</span> As in the distribution of the land among the tribes, so in the division of the cities among the tribes of Levi, the whole matter was referred to the judgment of God. Thus solemnly placed in His hands, the division would not afterwards become the occasion of jealousy or dispute. The division was first made between the descendants of the three sons of Levi, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari (see <a href="../../par/exodus/6-16.htm">Exodus 6:16-25</a>), and then, as regards the Kohathites, between the priests, the descendants of Aaron, and the rest of the Levites. We have remarked above (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-50.htm">Joshua 19:50</a>) on the disinterestedness of Joshua. We have now to remark on the same characteristic as displayed by Moses. There was no attempt on the part of Moses to "found a family," the object of ambition with most men, whether kings or private persons possessed of wealth. No special privileges belonged to his descendants. They merged in the undistinguished herd of the Levites generally. In this Moses contrasts favourably with most public men in our own day; he stands out prominently before nearly all the great leaders and conquerors before or even after the Christian era. The same may be said of Joshua, his successor. Cincinnatus may be in some measure compared with them, but as a dictator simply in time of danger, his power was by no means so absolute, nor were his temptations so great as those of the two successive leaders of the Israelites. <span class="cmt_word">Thirteen cities.</span> It has been contended by Maurer and others that this number of cities was largely in excess of what could possibly be required for the descendants of Aaron in so short a time. But we have to consider <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the cities were probably not, at least at first, inhabited exclusively by the priests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Israelites multiplied rapidly, and that the number of descendants in the fourth generation would probably be nearly a thousand, and in the fifth, above five thousand; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that all the cities were not, as yet, actually taken from the Canaanites at all, and so therefore were in all probability only intended as an eventual possession of the priests, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that the cities themselves were probably not of any very great size. It may be worthy of remark, as a proof of the accuracy of the writers of the Old Testament, and as a means of approximately ascertaining the date of the Book of Joshua, that Nob, mentioned as a priestly city in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-11.htm">1 Samuel 22:11, 19</a>, is not found in the list given here. For the number of priests being sure to increase, it is not surprising that in the course of time additional cities should be assigned to them. And since Nob is not mentioned here, we have good grounds for concluding that the Book of Joshua was not a compilation put together after the reign of Saul Calvin does not fail to remark on the prescience of God here demonstrated. He had fixed upon Jerusalem as the place where he would "put His Name." He therefore directed that the lot of the priests should fall within the limits of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, on whose borders Jerusalem stood. Simeon is also mentioned, but the territory of that tribe (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-1.htm">Joshua 19:1, 9</a>), was contained within the borders of Judah. <span class="cmt_word">For theirs was the first lot</span>. Not because Kohath was the firstborn, for this Gershon appears to have been, but because to Aaron and his sons had the priesthood been reserved.

We are not necessarily, therefore, to suppose that the land was mapped out into divisions analogous to our fields. Our word "land" would more accurately represent the meaning of the original, which refers to the arable and pasture land in the neighbourhood of the city, with the agricultural villages or homesteads dotted about it. Keil contends that the Levites only received as many houses within the city as they needed, and that the rest belonged to Caleb. Bahr, moreover ('Symbolik,' 2:49), supposed that the Levites dwelt with the other inhabitants of the city, and that the pasture land within the distance of 2,000 paces from the city was reserved for them, the rest of the land belonging to the inhabitants of the tribe (see note on Gezer, ch. 10:33). This seems the most probable explanation. The land in general was owned by the descendants of Caleb. But the Levites had certain pastures reserved for them, whither they drove their cattle (see note on suburbs, <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). The special information about Hebron here again is worthy of notice. It is copied by the author of 1 Chronicles in ch. 6.

They gave to him the city for which he asked, Thamnath Sarach gave they him in Mount Ephraim, and Joshua built the city, and dwelt in it. And Joshua took the stone knives, with which he had circumcised the children of Israel, which were in the way in the wilderness, and he placed them in Tamnath Sarach." The repetition is very much in the manner of the sacred historian, and it is possible that we have here an authentic passage, which some copyist has omitted in the Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">All the land.</span> As has been before remarked, the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5dc;</span> must not be pressed to mean literally "all." Yet, in a sense, the word is true here. The land had been put in their power. They had only to exert themselves to complete its conquest. This they failed to do, and not only so, but violated the conditions under which the land was granted them. Thus they soon fell under the dominion of those who had been their own vassals. Ritter thinks (vol. 3. 187-189) that the Asherites and Danites submitted to the inhabitants of the land in consequence of being allowed equal citizen rights with them. He draws this inference from <a href="../../par/judges/5-17.htm">Judges 5:17</a>, supposing that these tribes addicted themselves to the commercial and maritime life for which the Phoenicians were so famous. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord gave them rest.</span> LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. The student of Scripture will not fail to recall the passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="../../par/joshua/4-8.htm">Joshua 4:8</a>) in which reference is made to this passage, and especially to the LXX. version of it. The word signifies rather rest from wandering than rest from toil, though in some passages (e.g. <a href="../../par/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-14.htm">Deuteronomy 5:14</a>) it has the latter signification (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Round about.</span> Or, <span class="accented">from</span> round about, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the assaults of the surrounding nations. <span class="cmt_word">According to all that he sware</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">There stood not a man of all their enemies before them</span>. This was true, as far as the present history is concerned. We read that the Ephraimites did not, or "could not," drive out their enemies, and that the other tribes also failed to obtain complete possession of the land. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we are not told that this was in the time of Joshua, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is intimated that this was their own fault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How could it be otherwise? Had the same faith been theirs which caused the Jordan to dry up, and the towers of Jericho to fall down at their march, which discomfited one vast confederacy at Beth-horon, and annihilated another vast confederacy, even better supplied with munitions of war at Lake Merom, they could not have failed to root out the scanty remnant of their humiliated and disheartened foes. As has already been remarked (see <a href="../../par/joshua/11-23.htm">Joshua 11:23</a>, note), it was from no neglect on Joshua's part that this was not done at once, for it had been God's own command that it should not be done, lest the country should become a desert (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>). Calvin concludes a similar argument with the words, "nothing but their own cowardice prevented them from enjoying the blessings of God in all their fulness."

Thus a tribe, as has been before remarked, or even a family (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>), is spoken of frequently as a single individual (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/17-14.htm">Joshua 17:14, 15, 17, 18</a>). It seems probable that this chapter occurs in strict chronological order, and that the soldiers of the two tribes and a half remained under the national banner at Shiloh until the work of survey and appointment was completed. But this cannot be affirmed with certainty. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> with which the chapter commences, is not the usual word for chronological sequence, though it does not preclude it (see note on Joshua 8:30). And the time during which these soldiers must in this case have remained separated from their wives and families was a very long one. Some have even supposed that it lasted fourteen years (see ver. 3). On the other hand, the words "gathered together to Shiloh," in ver. 12, implies that the tribes west of Jordan had left Shiloh. Nor did there seem to be the least need for their services after the battle of Merom. We must be content to leave the matter in uncertainty, with the remark that if the armed men of the two tribes and a half did remain during this long period away from their homes, our sense of their ready obedience must be greatly enhanced, as also of the personal influence of the leader at whose instance they did so. <span class="cmt_word">The half tribe of Manaseh.</span> Some cities read <span class="hebrew">&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span> here for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, and as the tribe is spoken of in a political and not in a genealogical point of view, the reading, as far as internal considerations go, would seem preferable. The two words, however, are not always used with complete strictness, but are sometimes regarded as synonymous (see note on Joshua 13:29). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-2.htm">Joshua 22:2</a></div><div class="verse">And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you:</div><div class="comm">

The expression in the original implies more, a <span class="accented">great many</span> days, the usual expression for a period of considerable length. Thus the military service of these tribes must under any circumstances have been a prolonged and arduous one, and they well deserved the encomiums which Joshua here lavishes upon them. It is a remarkable and almost inexplicable fact, that while the sojourn in the wilderness is represented as one long catalogue of murmurings, not one single complaint (unless we may call the gentle expostulation of the tribe of Joseph, in ch. 17, a complaint) disturbs the peace of the tribes while Joshua led them. This remarkable consistency of the narrative throughout, so great a contrast to what precedes and what follows, and felt to be so by the writer (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>), is of itself no small pledge of the trustworthiness of the whole. A collector at random from various narratives, themselves to a considerable extent fictitious, could hardly have managed to cull portions which would form an harmonious whole. A writer who was inventing his details would hardly have thought of making his history so great a contrast to the rest of the history of Israel, save with the idea of exalting the character of his hero. But there is no attempt to set Joshua above Moses, or any other Jewish leader. In fact, it is an argument for the early composition of the hook that there is no reference, not even an allusion, to any later events in the history of Israel. Why there was this marked difference between Israel under Joshua, and Israel at any other time, is a question somewhat difficult to determine. Yet we may believe that it was the evidence of visible success. While the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they felt keenly, as men accustomed to a civilised and settled life, the inconveniences of a nomad existence. By their mingled impatience and cowardice they had forfeited their claim to God's protection. Even the observance of their feasts, and still further the rite of initiation into the covenant itself, were in abeyance (see notes on Joshua 5:2-8). So uncertain, humanly speaking, was their future, that it was as difficult a task, and one the successful accomplishment of which was above unassisted human powers, for Moses to keep them together in the wilderness, as it was for Joshua to lead them to victory in the promised land. And it is one of the commonest of Christian experiences, both in the history of individuals and of the Christian Church, that times of prosperity are times of content and outward satisfaction. It is the times of adversity that try men's faith and patience. As long as the Israelitish Church was subduing kingdoms, winning splendid victories, experiencing the encouragement derivable from God's sensible presence and intervention, there was no discontent, discouragement, or wavering. But the trials of the long wandering, as well as those incident to the quiet, unostentatious discharge of duty, were fatal to their faith and patience.

It is worthy of remark, that while beginning with the love of God, Joshua does not end there. The best proof of love is our conduct towards the person loved. If love be genuine, it is the practical principle which produces diligent service, punctual obedience, faithful attachment, the devotion of the heart and soul. <span class="cmt_word">Commandment and law.</span> The first of these words, derived from a root signifying to <span class="accented">set up</span>, has rather the force of what we call a <span class="accented">positive</span> precept, referring to single acts.

Four times (in <a href="../../par/joshua/13-8.htm">Joshua 13:8</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-3.htm">Joshua 14:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/18-7.htm">Joshua 18:7</a>, and here) does he repeat that the tribe of Manasseh was divided into two, and had its inheritance on either side Jordan. The same kind of repetition occurs in the narrative of the passing of the Jordan. It has been before remarked to be a characteristic of the style of the Old Testament generally, but nowhere is it found to a greater degree than in the Book of Joshua. Yet this, to which critics of the analytical school have objected as a sign of spuriousness, is in fact one of those peculiarities of style which mark the individuality of the writer. It is to inspired history what the Gospel and Epistles of St. John are to inspired theology. The form belongs to the author; the matter, at least as regards its general purport, belongs to God. A Hebrew writer, we are reminded in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' does not quote or refer to what has been already stated. If it is necessary to make his narrative clear, he repeats it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-8.htm">Joshua 22:8</a></div><div class="verse">And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Riches</span>.

And here, as elsewhere, we may observe the strict and scrupulous integrity of Joshua. The division of the spoil by other leaders has often been the cause of heart burnings and even of mutiny. Here each man has his due, and no room is left for reproach or dissatisfaction.

Bishop Horsley, however, would render a great altar <span class="accented">in appearance</span>, supposing that what is meant is that it only looked like an altar, and was not intended to be used as one. One of the most valuable results of the Palestine exploration movement has been the discovery of the site of this altar, which seems probable, in spite of Lieutenant Conder's abandonment of the theory in his 'Tent Work in Palestine,' 2:53. The reasons for the identification are as follows. The altar must be near one of the fords of Jordan. It must be on this side of Jordan (see note on vers. 24, 25). It must be in a conspicuous position, as we have just seen. Now Kurn Sartabeh or Surtubeh (see note on Joshua 3:16), visible from a great distance on all sides, from Ebal, from near Gennesaret, thirty miles off, from the Dead Sea, from the eastern high lands, and from the Judaean watershed (see Quarterly Paper of the Palestine Exploration Fund, Oct. 1874), fulfils all these conditions. Dr. Hutchinson replies (Quarterly Paper, Jan. 1876) that the altar is stated by Josephus to have been on the east side of Jordan, and that it was improbable that the two and a half tribes would have erected the altar on the cis-Jordanic territory, or so near to Shiloh, because Ephraim would have resented this. Moreover, the words, "a great altar <span class="accented">to be seen,"</span> would imply that it was to be visible from a long distance, so that the two tribes and a half might see it from their side of Jordan. It must be confessed that the evidence for the identification is but slight, but so also are the arguments against it. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus is not infallible, and the Hebrew text seems to assert the very opposite of what he says. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the other tribes <span class="accented">did</span> resent the erection of the altar. Lieutenant Conder now admits that it is possible that the words stating that the tribes crossed "by the passage of the children of Israel "(ver. 11, but see note there) leads to the idea that the ford by Jericho is meant, and not the Damieh ford by Kurn Sartabeh. See, however, the translation given below. The fact that the Arabs call the place the ascent of the father of Ayd, which has a close resemblance to the Hebrew word <span class="accented">Ed</span>, "witness," does not appear conclusive, though it lends some degree of probability to the theory. On the other hand, it might be contended that if the Reubenites and Gadites had not erected the altar on their own territory, it would not have excited the wrath of the remaining tribes. But as the best authorities are content to leave the matter uncertain, it must be left uncertain here.

We have before remarked (note on ver. 3) upon the singular obedience of the Israelites during the life of Joshua. The present incident is another exemplification of the fact. It is not Joshua who summons the children of Israel, it is they who voluntarily gather themselves together. The solemn provisions of the law have been infringed, they hasten at once, if necessary, to put the law in execution. The vivid sense of the triumphs they had enjoyed under Joshua, and the safety in which they now were enabled to dwell, filled their hearts with a strong, if short-lived, feeling of gratitude to Him who had done so great things for them, and of indignation against his foes. We may here observe two points which demonstrate the consistency of the narrative, and are evidences for its genuineness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The children of Israel were not remarkable for their obedience to the law, or to heaven-sent leaders. Both their previous and subsequent history forbid us to predicate for them the quality of obedience. Whence, then, comes this new born and ephemeral "zeal for the Lord," which displays itself in such a remarkable manner on the present occasion? Whence, but from the long catalogue of splendid victories and wonderful Divine interpositions recorded in this book, and from the sense of security arising out of them? Whence, but from the great fear of the children of Israel that had fallen upon the inhabitants of Canaan, so that, to use the striking expression of our historian in <a href="../../par/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a>, "none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The offence and its penalty are recorded in the book of t. he law, and especially in the Book of Deuteronomy. Unless, therefore, we are to conclude that all this history, in spite of its natural and life-like character, was entirely the invention of later ages, we can scarcely avoid the conclusion that Deuteronomy, as well as the other books of the Pentateuch, was in existence when these events occurred. For if not, where was the offence of the two tribes and a half? How was its gravity to be determined? What induced the rest of Israel, including apparently the other half of the tribe of Manasseh, to prepare for war with their brethren? The only rational explanation of the history is that the tribes beyond Jordan had contravened the provisions of the law of Moses, contained in the Book of Deuteronomy, and that the rest of Israel were preparing to inflict the punishment decreed in that law against such contravention. And these provisions and that punishment we find in the five books of that law as it is at present handed down to us. Our only alternatives, then, would seem to be, to reject the history, or to accept the law <span class="accented">in tote.</span> And if we take the former, we have to explain how it is that the law and the subsequent history, though entirely fabulous, came to be arranged into so harmonious and consistent a whole. <span class="cmt_word">To go up to war against them.</span> Calvin blames the Israelites a little unjustly here. They did not act rashly, as he asserts. Though they prepared to visit the offence with instant chastisement, they gave their brethren an opportunity of explanation. And when that explanation was given, it proved so entirely satisfactory that all hostile intentions were laid aside. "Not onely wisdom, but charitie moved them to this message. For grant they had been guilty, must they perish unwarned? Peaceable meanes must first be used to recall them, ere violence be sent to persecute them" (Bp. Hall). It is to be feared that Christians have not always so restrained their impetuosity when the cry that the faith was in danger has been raised, and that the zeal, so well tempered by discretion, of the Israelitish congregation at this time, is an example of both qualities which puts many Christians to shame. Even Masius cautions us here that we should not "temere moveamur suspicionibus." But he derives hence an argument, and cites St. Augustine in favour of it, for the doctrine that heretics may be proceeded against by the civil sword. Knobel's remark upon this verse is a perfect gem of the "destructive criticism." The account of all Israel gathering together to war against the two tribes and a half "is unsuitable to the circumspect and mild Elohist." Are all writers of history, except those who have no battles or sieges to describe, rash and savage by nature? And even the "circumspect and mild Elohist," or a member of the Peace Society itself, might venture to describe a gathering which, though at first it assumed a warlike form, ended in mutual explanations and a perfect understanding. Of a very different stamp is Bp. Hall's apostrophe, "O noble and religious zeale of Israel! Who would think these men the sonnes of them that danced around the molten calf?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-13.htm">Joshua 22:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest.</span> Their messenger was well chosen. He was the representative of the high priest, whose duty it was to call attention to all infringements of the law. He had proved his own fiery zeal for the purity of Israelitish faith and life by his conduct at a critical moment of his countrymen's history, when Balaam's miserable intrigues had brought the Israelites to the brink of destruction (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>). Such an envoy, if the trans-Jordanic tribes had indeed disobeyed God's command, was well qualified to bring them to a sense of their sin. Once again we find him in his proper position, at the head of the children of Israel (<a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>), and that was when they were once more assembled to avenge the atrocious crime of the men of Gibeah.

The actual head of each tribe accompanied him; that is, the head of the family, as we should call it, in each tribe. This seems preferable to Keil's idea, that some tribes were represented by a prince, and some by heads of families, which seems inadmissible from the fact that the Hebrew states that each tribe was represented in the same manner, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>. What is doubtless intended here is to emphasize the weight and importance of the deputation sent with Phinehas, a weight and importance befitting an embassy which might have to announce the determination to exterminate the two and a half tribes as completely as Jericho had been exterminated. The mention of <span class="accented">ten</span> princes shows that the cis-Jordanic half tribe of Manasseh was represented. Tribes.

The Hebrew word signifies to act deceitfully or faithlessly. It was an act of ingratitude towards the God who had established them in the good land in which they now found themselves. Such ingratitude and desertion of God was equivalent to rebellion, the term used immediately afterwards. The embassy clearly assumed that the fault had been committed, and that it would be necessary to proceed to extremities. Yet, deeply moved as they were, they did not refuse to listen to reason, and rejoiced that it was not necessary to inflict the fearful vengeance which otherwise would have been their duty. How great a contrast is this to the readiness, nay, even the eagerness, which many owning the Christian name have displayed to destroy the body, and the soul also, if that were possible, of their brethren in Christ, who have been overtaken, or have been supposed to be overtaken, in a similar fault!

It was Phinehas who had avenged the iniquity of Peer, and arrested the judgment for that offence as it was about to fall. How natural that the occurrence should be, as it were, branded upon his memory with a hot iron, and that the mention of it should spring at once to his lips when he saw his brethren, as he thought, upon the verge of a similar offence! Peor is, of course, a contraction for Baal-Peor (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-3.htm">Numbers 25:3</a>). This god derives his name probably from Mount Peer, or "the cloven mountain" (<a href="../../par/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From which we are not cleansed until this day.</span> Here we have the expression of the feeling which was never removed until Christ came. It was not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats could take away sin. No ceremonial lustrations could "cleanse us from its guilt and power." No destruction of the prime mover of the offence, though it may avert the wrath of God, can remove the moral reproach which lies upon the sinner. Not even the destruction of twenty-four thousand persons (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>) can purify Israel from the taint of pollution. In the eyes of a sincere servant like Phinehas, the stigma rests upon Israel still, nor could anything avail to take it away. Truly, the law was, indeed, "our schoolmaster, to bring us to Christ." What Keil says of Calvin's explanation, that "the remembrance was not yet quite buried, nor the anger of God extinct," is unsatisfactory. His own explanation, that "the heart of Israel still delighted in their sin," is even more so, since we have no evidence whatever that this was the case at the time of which we are speaking. We have here again to remark that the history in Numbers is here presupposed, and an allusion to an incident in Numbers is here placed in the mouth of one of the chief actors in it. How natural, if the history be a veracious one! How marvellously ingenious, if it he not! The circumstance is mentioned again in Hosea, in the time of Jotham or Hezekiah, and again in <a href="../../par/psalms/106.htm">Psalm 106</a>, which would appear to have been written during the captivity. Thus we have a chain of testimony concerning it which makes it difficult to assign a time for the invention of the story, if it be invented, since all references to it in Scripture are perfectly consistent with each other, and display none of the signs of gradual growth which we invariably find in the case of legends. <span class="cmt_word">A plague.</span> The original is noticeable, the plague; a natural mode of speech for one who well remembered it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-18.htm">Joshua 22:18</a></div><div class="verse">But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, <i>seeing</i> ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But that ye must turn.</span> The original has the imperfect, of an action not completed, "<span class="accented">and</span> ye <span class="accented">are</span> turning." There is no need to give the adversative sense to! The ye also is emphatic. "<span class="accented">Ye</span> are turning against the Lord today, tomorrow ye will involve the whole congregation in calamity." That tomorrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. This passage also is quite consistent with the circumstances and with the position of the speaker. Not merely anger but fear is visible throughout - fear of His wrath who had manifested His power so signally of late. There was no longer any temptation to rebel against Him. The Israelites were no longer suffering the daily pressure of comparative privation and distress, such as it was impossible to avoid in the wilderness. While, on the contrary, there was every reason to remember His power Who had driven the heathen out before them and planted them in, Who had not failed to punish them when they deserved it, and Who, by the fate of their enemies, had made it clear that His hands were not waxen short. Thus the heads of the tribes, and Phinehas especially, were alarmed lest Israel should forfeit the prosperity they at present enjoyed, and exchange it for those terrible woes that God had shown He could inflict when His people rebelled against Him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-19.htm">Joshua 22:19</a></div><div class="verse">Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession <i>be</i> unclean, <i>then</i> pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If the land of your possession be unclean.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">be defiled</span>, either by the idolatrous nations around, or by being cut off from the worship of the true God at Shiloh. The only satisfactory explanation of this somewhat difficult passage which has yet been given is that of Masius, who explains it of a possible belief on the part of the two and a half tribes, that they were cut off by Jordan into another land, a land which had no title to the promises and privileges of Israel, no share in the worship of the one true God at Shiloh. If they entertained such an idea, then, however unfounded their conviction, it were better far to abandon the land, how suited to their circumstances soever it might be, and come across the Jordan, and dwell in the midst of their brethren, and under the protection of the tabernacle of the Lord. Beside. That is, <span class="accented">separate from</span>, suggesting the idea of an exclusion of those who committed such an act from the worship of the Lord. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-20.htm">Joshua 22:20</a></div><div class="verse">Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Did not Achan the son of Zerah.</span> Here again the reference to the past history of Israel is suited to the speaker and the circumstances, and this appeal, therefore, strengthens our conviction that in the history of Achan we have fact and not fiction. The case of Achan is even more in point than that of Peer. In his case the Israelites had a clear proof that "one man's sin," unless completely and absolutely put away, brought God's dis. pleasure on "all the congregation" (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-22.htm">Numbers 16:22</a>). The repulse at Ai, fresh as it must have been in the memory of all, was sufficient evidence of this. How much more then would His displeasure fall upon Israel, if they condoned this act (as it seemed) of gross and open rebellion against the Lord who had brought them out of Egypt, and had put them in possession of the land He had promised them? <span class="cmt_word">Commit a trespass</span> (see note on ver. 16). <span class="cmt_word">In the accursed thing</span> (see note on Joshua 7:1). <span class="cmt_word">And that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">and he, one man, did not expire in his iniquity.</span> The Vulgate has, "and he was one man, and would that he had perished alone in his iniquity." The sense is the same as in our version. Achan did not perish alone, for not only did he involve his family in his ruin, but the loss of life at the first assault of Ai lay also at his door (see <a href="../../par/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-21.htm">Joshua 22:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thousands.</span> See above, ver. 14. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/22-22.htm">Joshua 22:22</a></div><div class="verse">The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if <i>it be</i> in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord God of gods.</span> The double repetition of this adjuration is suited to the greatness of the occasion. No words can suffice to express the horror and detestation of the two and a half tribes at the sin of which they have been supposed guilty. Nor does our version at all approach the majesty of the original form of oath. The Vulgate and Luther approach nearer to it when they render the one, "fortissimus Deus Dominus," and the other, "der starke Gott, der Herr." But no translation can do justice to the vigour of the original. The three names of God, El, Elohim, and Jehovah, are each twice repeated in their order. El representing the earliest Hebrew idea of God, strength (as that of the Aryans was splendour) comes first. Then Elohim, with its <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span>, suited to a nation whose theological holizon was expanding, and suggesting the manifold ways in which El the mighty one displayed His greatness, as the source of all power, mental, moral, and physical, in heaven and in earth. Then came the name by which He had revealed Himself to Moses, Jehovah, the Self-existent One, the author of all being, He whose supreme prerogative it was to have existed from all eternity, and from whose will all things were derived. It was impossible for any Israelite to have devised a more awful formula by which to clear themselves from the charge of rebellion against God. The same striking phrase is adopted by Asaph in the fiftieth Psalm, when he desires to give especial emphasis to the words of God which follow. Some of the Babbis interpret Elohim here of angels, and explain, "the God of angels." Dr. Perowne, on <a href="../../par/psalms/50-1.htm">Psalm 50:1</a>, prefers the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Lange, on this passage, translates feebly, "God, God Jehovah," but he abandons this in his commentary on <a href="../../par/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>. for the interpretation given above. Ewald prefers the LXX. rendering. Vaihinger suggests, "the mighty God Jehovah." But the majority of recent commentators prefer the rendering given above, and it is supported by Jewish authorities of credit (cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-14.htm">Jeremiah 32:14</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-32.htm">Nehemiah 9:32</a>). He knoweth. These words are in the strictest Hebrew form of the present tense. It is not merely implied that "God knows" as a general fact, but He is called to witness in the most emphatic manner. "He is at this moment aware that we are speaking the truth." Save us not this day. These words are not parenthetical, as in our version, but in their eagerness to clear themselves (another fact of vivid narration not to be lost sight of, as indicating that the information came originally from an eyewitness) they change the construction. "El Elohim Jehovah, El Elohim Jehovah, He is witness, and Israel shall know - if in rebellion, and if in transgression against the Lord, mayest Thou not save us this day - to build an altar to us, to turn from after the Lord." The whole sentence betokens the strong agitation of those who uttered it - "ex vehementissima animi perturbatione effundunt illi potiusquam pronuneiant" (Masius) - and to whatever period we may attribute the composition of the Book of Joshua, there can be little doubt that he had access to authentic documents, written by eyewitnesses of the scenes that are described. Rosenmuller discusses another interpretation, which regards these words as an address to Phinehas; but while admitting that it is a possible one, rejects it as less suitable to the context. Besides, it may be remarked that "save us" can only be addressed to God. To man, "spare us" would have been said.

The word here translated "anxiety" (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) is applied to the sea, and is translated "sorrow" in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-23.htm">Jeremiah 49:23</a>. It is translated "heaviness" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/12-25.htm">Proverbs 12:25</a>. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-18.htm">Ezekiel 12:18, 19</a>, it is translated "care," "carefulness," and is applied to eating food. It obviously refers to agitation or anxiety of mind, and the proper translation here is, "we did it out of anxiety, for a cause." So Masius and Rosenmuller, who render the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> here by <span class="accented">sollicitudo.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What have you to do with the Lord God of Israel? For the Lord hath made Jordan a border.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">What to you and to Jehovah the God of Israel, since He hath given a border between us and between you, sons of Reuben and sons of Gad, even the Jordan.</span> Thus the reason for the erection of the altar was the very converse of what it had been supposed to be. So far from considering themselves as shut out from the communion of Israel by the natural boundary formed by Jordan, the two and a half tribes were resolved that no one else should ever think so. If the descendants of the remainder of the Israelites should ever venture to assert anything of the kind, there was the altar, erected in a conspicuous position on the west side of Jordan, left as a perpetual memorial of the great struggle in which Reuben, Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh had taken part, and which had resulted in the final occupation of the land of Canaan. Keil and Delitzsch remark that there was some reason for this anxiety. The promises made to Abraham and his posterity related only to the land of Canaan. For their own advantage these tribes had chosen to remain in the trans-Jordanic territory conquered by Moses. It was quite possible that in future ages they might be regarded as outside the blessings and privileges of the Mosaic covenant. For the present, at least, they value those blessings and privileges, and desired to have some permanent memorial of the fact that they had a right to share them. <span class="cmt_word">From fearing.</span> It may be worth while to notice, as a sign of later, or at least of different authorship, that the Pentateuch employs a different (the feminine) form of the infinitive for the form found here.

The existence of an exact reproduction of the altar in Shiloh, erected on Canaanitish ground by the two and a half tribes before their departure across Jordan, was an incontestible proof of their original connection with Israel. And the fact that they had erected it, not on their own territory, but on that of their brethren, was, though they do not use the argument, proof positive that it was not intended to be used in contravention of the precepts of the law. The nature of the <span class="accented">facsimile</span> is explained by <a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>, where the precise form of altar seems to have been presented as a contrast to the stone altars employed by the heathen.

So Keil, Gesenius, and Knobel. <span class="cmt_word">That we should rebel against the Lord.</span> The embassy had the effect not only of eliciting an explanation, but of showing how earnest, at that time at least, the tribes of Israel were in the service of God. And we may learn here, as Robertson remarks of St. Paul's frank and explicit vindications of himself, the value of explanations. Many a misunderstanding would be averted, many a feeling of rankling displeasure, culminating in an inexcusable explosion of anger, might be avoided, nay, many an unjust suspicion against a fellow Christian's honesty and sincerity of purpose might be dispelled, if men would but follow the example of the ten tribes on this occasion, or lay to heart the words of our Lord in St. <a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>, "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."

Had they been actuated by jealousy or party spirit, they would have admitted no defence, or have endeavoured out of the clearest exculpation to find some new topic for complaint. So religious party spirit has been wont to inflame men's minds in later times, so that they desired rather victory over a supposed antagonist than the discovery that no offence at all bad been committed. True religious zeal is slow to anger, and easy to be appeased, when it appears that no harm has been intended. It might have been contended in this case, if controversy rather than truth had been the object, that the action had a dangerous tendency; that though the altar was not intended for sacrifice, it might be used for that purpose; that it was unwise to put a temptation in the way of future ages to substitute worship there for worship in the tabernacle. Such arguments are not unknown even to Christian zealots. Israel was satisfied that no harm was intended. It was not thought necessary to point out possibilities which were not likely to be realised.

This word is not in the original. It is found in some late MSS. and in the Syriac and Arabic versions, but not in the LXX. or Chaldee. Even in the MSS. which have it, the word is found sometimes before and sometimes after the Hebrew word signifying "altar." This may either be because, once omitted, it was conjecturally supplied, but it is more probable that it was never there at all. The passage may be rendered, "And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad gave a name to the altar, 'for it is a witness between us.'" But it seems more likely that the word "Ed," though not expressed, is in. tended to be understood. The LXX. and Vulgate give incorrect renderings of the passage. The Lord is God. Rather, as in <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-39.htm">1 Kings 18:39</a>, Jehovah is the God; that is, the one true God.

But this refers to a more advanced age still, when the patriarch felt his powers failing him, and desired, as far as his influence went, to preserve the Israelites in the path in which they had walked since their entrance into Canaan. Calvin has some good remarks on the "pious solicitude" shown by the aged warrior for those whom he had led in time of war and guided in time of peace. He seems to have sent for the chief men in Israel to his home at Timnath-Serah, where apparently he had led a retired and peaceful life, only coming forward to direct the affairs of the nation when necessity required. His address is simple and practical. He reminds them that they will soon lose the benefit of his experience and authority, and of the work that he had done, under God's direction, in settling them in the land. Then he proceeds to urge strict obedience to the law of God, reminding them that victory is assured to them, if they will but be true to themselves and their calling as the servants of God, but that as certainly as they neglect to do so, wrath and misery will be their portion. He emphasizes his words by reminding them how amply God had fulfilled his promise, and concludes with a picture of the evil which will befall them if they rebel against God.

This, however, need not of necessity be imputed to them as a sin. For, as we have seen, the conquest was to be gradual. No doubt there was enough to be done in consolidating the conquests already made, in settling the tribes in their possessions, to occupy all the days of Joshua, and even possibly a longer period. At least we may he sure that, as long as Joshua lived, the heathen settlements were kept distinct from the Israelitish community, that intermarriages were not allowed, nor rights of citizenship granted to any but the Gibeonites. <span class="cmt_word">Cut off.</span> Joshua's speech here exactly agrees with the statements in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/8-26.htm">Joshua 8:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28-41</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-11.htm">Joshua 11:11, 14, 21</a>. Here at least, if Joshua's speech and the history were taken from two different sources, neither of them precisely accurate, the first postulate of the destructive criticism, we might have expected some slight discrepancy. But Joshua uses a word which implies total extermination, a feature, be it observed, of the campaigns of Moses and Joshua only, and not of the later Israelitish history. <span class="cmt_word">Westward</span>.

It seems incredible that such a book should have been invented at a time when the precepts it contained were lightly regarded, and should have been represented as the proper standard of conduct when every one knew that it could never have been anything of the kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-7.htm">Joshua 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear <i>by them</i>, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That ye come not among these nations</span> (see note on ver. 4).

The Hebrew has the signification <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to bring to remembrance, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to praise or celebrate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The former is the better idea here, "let them not be named among you, as becometh saints," let them be quite forgotten, as though they had never been heard of; and this not with a purely theological, but with an ethical purpose, since "fornication and all uncleanness and greediness" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; see <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-3.htm">Ephesians 5:3</a>) were the first principles of their rites (see Introduction). <span class="cmt_word">Nor cause to swear by them.</span> These words are found in connection with what follows in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>. So with "serve" and "bow down" (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-19.htm">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>, etc.). Here again we have Joshua quoting Deuteronomy as the book of the Law of Moses. According to the "Deuteronomist" theory, the quotation is an audacious fiction, manufactured by the person who was at that moment forging the book from which he pretended to quote. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-8.htm">Joshua 23:8</a></div><div class="verse">But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But cleave unto the Lord your God.</span> Or, <span class="accented">ye shall cleave unto Jehovah</span> your God. The phrase denotes the intimate union between God and the soul (see above, and <a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-9.htm">Joshua 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but <i>as for</i> you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord your God hath driven out.</span> So the Masora and the LXX. The Vulgate and the margin of our version translate by the future. So Luther also. The next verse is undeniably future. An appeal to their experience, which did not fail (see <a href="../../par/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a>) to be effective as long as the memory of these things was fresh in their minds. So in the Prayer Book of the Church of England we find the appeal, "O God, we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have declared unto us, the noble works that thou didst in their days, and in the old time before them." And the passage (<a href="../../par/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1-3</a>), from which the idea of this petition is taken, is an allusion to this speech of Joshua. And we often, in times of faintheartedness or sloth, need to be thus reminded of the moral and spiritual victories of the true Israel, under the true Joshua the Saviour, over the enemies with whom we are forbidden to make a compromise. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a></div><div class="verse">One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he <i>it is</i> that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One man of you shall chase a thousand.</span> A quotation from the song of Moses (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-11.htm">Joshua 23:11</a></div><div class="verse">Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take good heed to yourselves.</span> This is quoted from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-15.htm">Deuteronomy 4:15</a>, word for word. The Hebrew is, <span class="accented">take heed exceedingly to your souls</span>; but the meaning is either "as you value your lives" (Gesenius), or "with all your soul" (Keil). The former appears preferable. A third interpretation, however, "guard your souls diligently," is suggested by a comparison of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9, 15</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-12.htm">Joshua 23:12</a></div><div class="verse">Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, <i>even</i> these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go back.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">return.</span> Cleave. A word (see ver. 8) signifying close and intimate relationship. And the intimacy of the relationship is indicated, as in ver. 8, by the use of the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Make marriages with them.</span> No closer or more intimate relationship is possible than this. Nothing, therefore, would be more certain to draw the Israelites away from their allegiance to God, and to seduce them and their children into the false and corrupt worship of the nations around them. "Unde deprecor vos qui fidelis estis, ut ita vitam vestram et conversationem servetis, ne in aliquo vel ipsi scandalum patiamini vel aliis scandalum faciatis; sit in vobis summi studii, summaeque cautelae, ne quis in hanc sanctam congregationem vestram pollutus introeat" (Orig., Hom. 21 on Joshua). Go in unto them. Rather, <span class="accented">go among them.</span> Spoken of the familiar intercourse of friendship. It is equivalent to our words "associate with them." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-13.htm">Joshua 23:13</a></div><div class="verse">Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out <i>any of</i> these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Snares and traps.</span> Perhaps, rather, <span class="accented">nets and snares.</span> The LXX., where our translation has snare, has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and for traps has incorrectly <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. The snare or <span class="accented">pach</span> was evidently (<a href="../../par/amos/3-5.htm">Amos 3:5</a>) laid upon the earth; but there is no evidence for Gesenius' idea that the <span class="accented">mokesh</span> which follows, there as here, means the stick of the trap, which when displaced involved the bird in the net. As the primary signification of this latter word, which is akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> a bow, seems to mean something curved, it is probably a noose or springe. And the word and its cognates are used of involving, or catching, people by its use. Furst's Lexicon confirms this view, which has been independently arrived at. <span class="cmt_word">Scourges</span>. The Hebrew word is in the singular. It is translated <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, nails, in the LXX., and <span class="accented">offendiculum in the</span> Vulgate. <span class="cmt_word">In your sides.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">on</span> your sides. The words here are very similar to those in <a href="../../par/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>. Moses, however, does but use two of the similes of which here we have four. He has, moreover, a different word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) for thorns, and the word here translated thorns is there substituted for scourges; "thorns in your sides." Joshua crowds together his similes "to describe the shame, and trouble, and oppression which they would bring upon themselves by joining in the idolatry of the Canaanites" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord your God.</span> Here, as elsewhere in this and many other passages, we have in the original, <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> your God. It is important to remember that the sacred writer is calling the God of Israel by His own proper name, that by which He was distinguished from the gods of the nations round about. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-14.htm">Joshua 23:14</a></div><div class="verse">And, behold, this day I <i>am</i> going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, <i>and</i> not one thing hath failed thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And not one thing hath failed thereof.</span> This is a good instance of the habit of repetition so common to Hebrew writers. It is to be remembered that they had no italics, no stops, and, owing to the want of copiousness in their language, a great want generally of the means possessed in more modern languages of emphasizing their words. They, therefore, had recourse to what is still a favourite rhetorical artifice, the practice of repetition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/23-15.htm">Joshua 23:15</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All good things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the good word.</span> That is to say, the prophecies of good had been fulfilled. Joshua uses this as an argument that the evil also will not fail to follow, if Israel provoke God to inflict it. But the memory of these words, and of the great deeds of Jehovah, faded quickly from their minds. And then, like the people of the earth before the flood, like the men of Sodom before it was destroyed, and like many other people since, they turned a deaf ear to the prophecies of evil which faithful souls foresaw and foretold. The warnings of the prophets are but a variation upon the predictions of Moses in <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-33</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-14.htm">Deuteronomy 29:14-28</a>, and of Joshua, here addressed to a generation who had brought some of the predicted evil upon themselves, and would not see that by refusing to listen, they would bring upon themselves yet more. How terribly have these predictions been fulfilled! First, the Babylonish captivity; then the disorders and anarchy in a territory which the Jewish people inhabited, but which they were not strong enough to rule; then the siege of and destruction of Jerusalem under Titus with its accompanying horrors. Then the dispersion of the Jews among all the nations, the barbarous and inhuman persecutions they met with in the Middle Ages from priest and monarch alike: the Inquisition in Spain, the contempt and hatred which continued to be felt for them among more enlightened nations, as evidenced in Marlowe's 'Jew of Malta,' and Shakespeare's 'Merchant of Venice,' in the days of our own Queen Elizabeth. Only in our own age has a brighter day begun to dawn on them, and three thousand years of oppression, relieved only by the brief glories of David and his dynasty, are beginning to be compensated by a share in the world's rewards and honours. <span class="cmt_word">All evil things.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">all the evil word</span>; or <span class="accented">thing</span>; every evil thing, that is, which had been foretold.

But there is not the slightest MSS. authority for the reading, and it is contrary to all sound principles of criticism to resort to arbitrary emendations of the text. Besides, the LXX. itself reads <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;</span>, in ver. 26, and adds, "before the tabernacle of the God of Israel," words implied, but not expressed in the Hebrew. We are therefore driven to the supposition that this gathering was one yet more solemn than the one described in the previous chapter. The tabernacle was no doubt removed on this great occasion to Shechem. The locality, as Poole reminds us, was well calculated to inspire the Israelites with the deepest feelings. It was the scene of God's first covenant with Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6, 7</a>), and of the formal renewal of the covenant related in <a href="../../par/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2-4</a> (see note on vers. 23, 26), and in <a href="../../par/joshua/8-30.htm">Joshua 8:30-35</a>, when the blessings and the curses were inscribed on Mount Gerizim and Ebal, and the place where Joseph's bones (ver. 32) were laid, possibly at this time, or if not, at the time when the blessings and curses were inscribed. And now, once again, a formal renewal of the covenant was demanded from Israel by their aged chieftain, before his voice should cease to be heard among them any more. Rosenmuller reminds us that Josephus, the Chaldee and Syriac translators, and the Aldine and Complutensian editions of the LXX. itself, have Sichem. Bishop Horsley makes the very reasonable suggestion that Shiloh was not as yet the name of a town, but possibly of the tabernacle itself, or the district in which it had been pitched. And he adds that Mizpeh and Sheehem, not Shiloh, appear to have been the places fixed upon for the gathering of the tribes (see <a href="../../par/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-11.htm">Judges 11:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> (cf. ver. 27); <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>).

Some additional probability is given to this view by the fact noticed above, that it is thought necessary to describe the situation of Shiloh in <a href="../../par/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>, and we may also fail to notice that the words translated "house of God" in <a href="../../par/judges/20-18.htm">Judges 20:18, 26</a> in our version, is in reality Bethel, there being no "house of God" properly so called, but only the "tabernacle of the congregation." The tabernacle in that ease would be moved from place to place within the central district assigned to it, as necessity or convenience dictated. Hengstenberg objects to the idea that the tabernacle was moved to Shechem that it would have led to an idea that God was only present in His Holy Place, to which it is sufficient to <span class="accented">reply</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that this does not necessarily follow, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that such a conception was entertained, though erroneously, by some minds. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Samaritan woman, for instance, supposed the Jews to believe that in Jerusalem only ought men to worship (<a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a>). When Hengstenberg says, however, that the meeting in the last chapter had reference to Israel from a theocratic and religious, and this one from an historical point of view, he is on firmer ground. The former exhortation is ethical, this historical. He goes on to refer to the deeply interesting historical traditions centering round this place, which have been noticed above. The oak in ver. 26, Hengstenberg maintains to be the same tree that is mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> (where our version has, erroneously, "plain"), and which is referred to both in <a href="../../par/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a> and here <span class="accented">as the</span> (<span class="accented">i.e</span>, the well known) terebinth in Shechem (see note on ver. 26). He has overlooked the fact that the tree in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> is not an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> but an <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. He goes on to contend that the terebinth was not merely "by" but "in" the sanctuary of the Lord, which he supposes to be another sanctuary beside the tabernacle, perhaps the sacred enclosure round Abraham's altar. But he is wrong, as has been shown below, (ver. 26), when he says that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> never signifies near (see Joshua 5:25). The question is one of much difficulty, and cannot be satisfactorily settled. But we may dismiss without fear, in the light of the narative in ch. 22, Knobel's suggestion that an altar was erected here on this occasion. If there were any altar, it must have been the altar in the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Other gods.</span> That the family of Nahor were not exactly worshippers of the one true God in the same pure ritual as Abraham, may be gathered from the fact that Laban had teraphim (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19, 30</a>). But recent researches have thrown some light on the condition of Abraham's family and ancestors. If Ur Casdim be identified, as recent discoverers have supposed, with Mugeyer, which, though west of Euphrates as a whole, is yet to the eastward of one of its subordinate channels (see 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Arebaeology,' 3:229; Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p. 4), its ruins give us plentiful information concerning the creed of its inhabitants. We may also find some information about this primeval city in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:15, and in Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries,' p. 233. The principal building of this city is the temple of the moon god Ur. One of the liturgical hymns to this moon god is in existence, and has been translated into French by M. Lenormant. In it the moon is addressed as Father, earth enlightening god, primeval seer, giver of life, king of kings, and the like. The sun and stars seem also to have been objects of worship, and a highly developed polytheistic system seems to have culminated in the horrible custom of human sacrifices. This was a recognised practice among the early Accadians, a Turanian race which preceded the Semitic in these regions. A fragment of an early Accadian hymn has been preserved, in which the words "his offspring for his life he gave" occur, and it seems that the Semitic people of Ur adopted it from them. A similar view is attributed to Balak in <a href="../../par/micah/6-5.htm">Micah 6:5, 6</a>, and was probably derived from documents which have since perished (see Tomkins, 'Studies on the Time of Abraham,' p 24). Hence, no doubt the Moloch, or Molech, worship which was common in the neighbourhood of Palestine, and which the descendants of Abraham on their first entrance thither rejected with such disgust (see also <a href="../../par/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22</a>, where Abraham seems to have some difficulties connected with his ancestral creed). Other deities were worshipped in the Ur of the Chaldees. Sumas, the sun god, Nana, the equivalent of Astarte, the daughter of the moon god, Bel and Belat, "his lady." "In truth," says Mr. Tomkins, in the work above cited, "polytheism was stamped on the earth in temples and towers, and the warlike and beneficent works of kings. Rimmon was the patron of the all-important irrigation, Sin of brickmaking and building, Nergal of war." A full account of these deities will be found in Rawlinson's 'Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1.

Until the vision to Moses, the God of Israel had no distinctive name. After that time Jehovah was the recognised name of the God of Israel, as Chemosh of the Moabites, Milcom of the Ammonites, Baal of the Phoenicians. Our translation, "the Lord," somewhat obscures this. <span class="cmt_word">Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">of the river.</span> Euphrates is meant, on the other side of which (see, however, note on last verse) lay Ur of the Chaldees. It is worthy of notice that there is no evidence of the growth of a myth in the narrative here. We have a simple abstract of the history given us in the Pentateuch, without the slightest addition, and certainly without the invention of any further miraculous details. All this goes to establish the position that we have here a simple unvarnished history of what occurred. The manufacture of prodigies, as every mythical history, down to the biographies of Dominic and Francis, tells us, is a process that cannot stand still. Each successive narrator deems it to be his duty to embellish his narrative with fresh marvels. Compare this with the historical abridgment before us, and we must at least acknowledge that we are in the presence of phenomena of a very different ruder. Professor Goldziher has argued, in his 'Mythology among the Hebrews,' that Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, and Jacob are solar myths, such as we find in immense abundance in Cox's 'Aryan Mythology.' Abraham (father of height)is the nightly sky. Sarah (princess) is the moon. Isaac (he shall laugh) is the smiling sunset or dawn. It would be difficult to find any history which, by an exercise of similar ingenuity, might not be resolved into myths. Napoleon Bonaparte, for instance, might be resolved into the rushing onset of the conqueror who was never defeated. The retreat from Moscow is a solar myth of the most obvious description. The battle of Bull's Run is clearly so named from the cowardice displayed there by the sons of John Bull. It is remarked by Mr. Tomkins that Ur, the city of the moon god, lends itself most naturally to the fabricator of myths. There is only one objection to the theory, and that is the bricks, still in existence, stamped with the words Urn, which compel us to descend from this delightful cloud land of fancy to the more sober regions of solid and literal fact (see 'Studies on the Times of Abraham,' pp. 205-207). In old time. Literally, <span class="accented">from everlasting, i.e</span>, from time immemorial, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The Rabbinic tradition has great probability in it, that Abraham was driven out of his native country for refusing to worship idols. It is difficult to understand his call otherwise. No doubt his great and pure soul had learned to abhor the idolatrous and cruel worship of his countrymen. By inward struggles, perhaps by the vague survival of the simpler and truer faith which has been held to underlie every polytheistic system, he had "reached a purer air," and learned to adore the One True God. His family were led to embrace his doctrines, and they left their native land with him. But Haran, with its star worship, was no resting place for him. So he journeyed on westward, leaving the society of men, and preserving himself from temptation by his nomad life. No wandering Bedouin, as some would have us believe (see Drew, 'Scripture Lands,' p. 18), but a prince, on equal terms with Abimelech and Pharaoh, and capable of overthrowing the mighty conqueror of Elam. Such an example might well be brought to the memory of his descendants, who were now to be sojourners in the land promised to their father. Guided by conscience alone, with every external influence against him, he had worshipped the true God in that land. No better argument could be offered to his descendants, when settled in that same land, and about to be bereft of that valuable support which they had derived from the life and influence of Joshua.

Add to this the fact that this speech is ascribed to Joshua, and that the historian, as we have seen, had access to authentic sources of information, and we cannot avoid the conclusion that the hypothesis of the existence of the written law of Moses at the time of the death of Joshua has a very high degree of probability. The word rendered "plagued" is literally <span class="accented">smote</span>, but usually with the idea of a visitation from God. <span class="cmt_word">And afterward I brought you out.</span> The absence of any mention of the plagues here is noteworthy. It cannot be accounted for on the supposition that our author was ignorant of them, for we have ample proof that the Book of Joshua was compiled subsequently to the Pentateuch. This is demonstrated by the quotations, too numerous to specify here, which have been noticed in their place. We can only, therefore, regard the omission made simply for the sake of brevity, and because they were so well known to all, as a sign of that tendency, noticed under ver. 1, to abstain from that amplification of marvels common to all mythical histories. Had Joshua desired to indulge a poetic imagination, an admirable opportunity was here afforded him.

Whatever may be said of the rest of the narrative, this speech of Joshua's must have been written subsequently to the appearance of the books of Moses in their present form. But is there any trace of the later Hebrew in this chapter more than any other?

The image is a lively and natural one, and it well expresses the dismay which, as we read, seized the inhabitants of the land when their foes, formidable rather from Divine protection then from their number or warlike equipments, had crossed the Jordan (see <a href="../../par/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>).

He invites them, as Elijah did on another even more memorable occasion, to make their choice between the false worship and the true, between the present and the future, between the indulgence of their lusts and the approval of their conscience. But as for himself, his choice is already made. No desire to stand well with the children of Israel obscures the clearness of his vision. No temptations of this lower world pervert his sense of truth. The experience of a life spent in His service has convinced him that Jehovah is the true God. And from that conviction he does not intend to swerve. In days when faith is weak and compromise has become general, when the sense of duty is slight or the definitions of duty vague, it is well that the spirit of Joshua should be displayed among the leaders in Israel, and that there should be those who will take their stand boldly upon the declaration," But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."

The only doubt is that afterwards expressed by Joshua, whether the feeling were likely to be permanent. The best test of sincerity is not always the open hostility of foes, for this very often braces up the energies to combat, while at the same time it makes the path of duty clear. Still less is it the hour of triumph over our foes, for then there is no temptation to rebel. The real test of our faithfulness to God is in most cases our power to continue steadfastly in one course of conduct when the excitement of conflict is removed, and the enemies with which we have to contend are the insidious allurements of ease or custom amid the common place duties of life. Thus the Israelites who, amid many murmurings and backslidings, kept faithful to the guidance of Moses in the wilderness, and who followed with unwavering fidelity the banner of Joshua in Palestine, succumbed fatally to the temptations of a life of peace and quietness after his death. So too often does the young Christian, who sets out on his heavenward path with earnest desires and high aspirations, who resists successfully the temptations of youth to unbelief or open immorality, fall a victim to the more insidious snares of compromise with a corrupt society, and instead of maintaining a perpetual warfare with the world, rejecting its principles and despising its precepts, sinks down into a life of ignoble ease and self indulgence, in the place of a life of devotion to the service of God. He does not east off God's service, he does not reject Him openly, but mixes up insensibly with His worship the worship of idols which He hates. Such persons halt between two opinions, they strive to serve two masters, and the end, like that of Israel, is open apostasy and ruin.

Their sin was not open rebellion, but the attempt to engraft upon God's service conduct incompatible with it, which led in practice to the same result - a final antagonism to God. But they believed in Jehovah; they had no doubt of the miracles He had worked, nor of the fact that His protecting hand had delivered them from all their perils, and had achieved for them all their victories. Nor do we find, amid all their sins, that they ever committed themselves to a formal denial of His existence and authority.

The LXX., which has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, gives the true sense. After the enumeration of the great things God Jehovah has done for them, the Israelites break off, and, referring to the declaration of Joshua in ver. 15, "but as for me and my house, we will serve Jehovah," reply, "we too will serve Jehovah, for He is our God." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/24-19.htm">Joshua 24:19</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he <i>is</i> an holy God; he <i>is</i> a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the Lord.</span> Calvin thinks that Joshua said this to rouse the sluggish heart of the people to some sense of their duty. But this is quite contrary to the fact, for the heart of the people, as we have seen (ch. 22.), was <span class="accented">not</span> sluggish. As little can we accept the explanation of Michaelis, who paraphrases, "Ye will not be able, from merely human resolutions, to serve God." Joshua was stating nothing but a plain fact, which his own higher conception of the law had taught him, that the law was too "holy, just, and good" for it to be possible that Israel should keep it. He had forebodings of coming failure, when he looked on one side at the law with its stern morality and rigorous provisions, and the undisciplined, untamed people that he saw around him. True and faithful to the last, he set before them the law in all its majesty and fulness, the nature of its requirements, and the unsuspected dangers that lay in their weak and wayward hearts. No doubt he had a dim presentiment of the truth, to teach which, to St. Paul, required a miracle and three years' wrestling in Arabia, that by the deeds of the law "shall no flesh be justified in God's sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>). As yet the Spirit of God had barely begun to unveil the figure of the Deliverer who was to declare at once God's righteousness and His forgiveness. Yet none the less did Joshua do his duty, and strove to brace up the Israelites to theirs, not by disguising the nature of the undertaking to which they were pledging themselves, but by causing them to be penetrated with a sense of its awfulness and of the solemn responsibilities which it entailed. St. Augustine thinks that Joshua detected in the Israelites already the signs of that self righteousness which St. Paul (<a href="../../par/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>) blames, and that he wished to make them conscious of it. But this is hardly borne out by the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">He is a holy God.</span> The <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> is used here in the case of the adjective as well as the substantive. This is to enhance the idea of the holiness which is an essential attribute of God. <span class="cmt_word">He is a Jealous God.</span> The meaning is that God will not permit others to share the affections or rights which are His due alone. The word, which, as its root, "to be red," shows, was first applied to human affections, is yet transferred to God, since we can but approximate to His attributes by ideas derived from human relations. Not that God stoops to the meanness and unreasonableness of human jealousy. His vindication of His rights is no other than reasonable in Him. "His glory" He not only "will not," but cannot "give to another." And therefore, as a jealous man does, yet without his infirmity, God refuses to allow another to share in what is due to Himself alone. The word, as well as the existence of the Mosaic covenant, has no doubt led the prophets to use, as they do on innumerable occasions, the figure of a husband and wife (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-25.htm">Ezekiel 23:25</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2, 13, 16</a> (margin), Hosea 2:19, 20) in describing the relations of God to His Church, and approximate to His attitude towards His people by the illustration of an injured husband towards a faithless wife (see also <a href="../../par/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-15.htm">Deuteronomy 6:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/23-21.htm">Exodus 23:21</a>). There were many words used for "forgive" in Scripture: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> (see Pearson's learned note in his 'Treatise on the Creed,' Art. 10). The one here used signifies to remove or to bear the burden of guilt, corresponding to the word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> in the New Testament. The word here translated" transgressions" is not the same as in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15</a>, and the cognate word to the one rendered "transgressed" in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-11.htm">Joshua 7:11</a>, is here rendered "sins." It signifies a "breach of covenant," while the word translated" sins" is the equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.

St. James is speaking of God as He is in Himself, sublime in His unchangeableness and bountiful purposes towards mankind. Joshua and the prophets, speaking by way of accommodation to our imperfect modes of expression, speak of Him as He is in relation to us. In reality it is not He but we who change. He has no more altered His position than the sun, which, as we say, rises in the east and sets in the west. But as He is in eternal opposition to all that is false or evil, we, when we turn aside from what is good and true, must of necessity exchange His favour for His displeasure. <span class="cmt_word">Do you hurt.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">do evil to you.<span class="cmt_word"></span> After that he hath done you good.</span> This implies what has been before stated, that it is not God who is inconsistent but man, not God who has changed His mind, but man who has changed his.

Like a true guide and father, he has placed the case fully and fairly before them, and they have made their choice. He reminds them that their own words so deliberately uttered will be forever witnesses against them, should they afterwards refuse to keep an engagement into which they entered with their eyes open. They do not in any way shrink from the responsibility, and by accepting the situation as it is placed before them, render it impossible henceforth to plead ignorance or surprise as an excuse for their disobedience. And it is well to observe, as has been remarked above, that such an excuse never was pleaded afterwards, that the obligation, though evaded, was never disavowed.

But this is very improbable. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the word is the same as we find translated in ver. 17, "through whom." And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the internal scrutiny which the law demanded was hardly so well understood at this early period as by diligent study it afterwards became. The plain provisions of the law demanded obedience. Comparatively little heed was given at first to inward feelings and tendencies. There can be little doubt that the meaning is precisely the same as in <a href="../../par/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>, and that though the Israelites dare not openly worship strange gods, yet that teraphim and other images were, if not worshipped, yet preserved among them in such a way as to be likely to lead them into temptation. The history of Micah in <a href="../../par/judges/17-5.htm">Judges 17:5</a> is a proof of this, and it must be remembered that this history is out of its proper place. The zealous Phinehas (<a href="../../par/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>) was then still alive, and the worship at Micah's house had evidently been carried on for some time previous to the disgraceful outrage at Gibeah. The putting away the strange gods was to be the outward and visible sign, the inclining of the heart the inward and spiritual grace wrought within them by the mercy of God. For it is not denied that God desired their affections, and that those affections could scarcely be given while their heart went secretly after idols. It may be further remarked in support of this view that the Israelites are not exhorted to turn their heart from the false gods, but to put them away. It is a plain, positive precept, not a guide for the inner consciousness. On the other hand, the command to incline the heart to the Lord rests upon the simple ground of common gratitude. St. Augustine thinks that if any false gods were secretly in Israel at this time, they would have been met by a severer punishment than that accorded to Achan. Masius - "pace divini viri" - proceeds to argue that murders, thefts, and adulteries were worse sins than those of Achan, that it were not reasonable to suppose that Israel was free from such sins, and they were not punished like Achan's. He forgets to urge <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the condition of the children of Israel was very different in Achan's time to that of the death of Joshua, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Achan's was a special act of disobedience to a very special enactment, considerations which would have materially strengthened his argument.

The word used for covenant<span class="accented">, berith</span>, is derived from another word having the same meaning. This appears more probable than the suggestion of some, that the <span class="accented">berith</span> is derived from the practice of ratifying an agreement by a social meal. <span class="cmt_word">And set them a statute and ordinance.</span> Or, <span class="accented">appointed them a statute and a judgment.</span> The word translated "statute" is derived from the same root as our word <span class="accented">hack</span>, signifying to <span class="accented">cut</span>, and hence to engrave in indelible characters. The practice of engraving inscriptions, proclamations, and the like, on tablets was extremely common in the East. We have instances of it in the two tables of the law, and in the copy of the law engraven in stones on Mount Ebal. The Moabite stone is another instance. And the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian monarchs seem to have written much of their history in this way (see note on Joshua 8:32). The word rendered "ordinance" is far more frequently rendered "judgment" in our version, and seems to have the original signification of a thing set upright, as a pillar on a secure foundation. <span class="cmt_word">In Shechem</span> (see note on ver. 1). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/24-26.htm">Joshua 24:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua wrote these words.</span> Or, these <span class="accented">things</span>, since the word (see note on Joshua 22:24; 23:15) has often this signification. Joshua no doubt recorded, not the whole history of his campaigns and the rest of the contents of what is now called the Book of Joshua, but the public ratification of the Mosaic covenant which had now been made. This he added to his copy of the book of the law, as a memorial to later times. The covenant had been ratified with solemn ceremonies at its first promulgation (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3-8</a>). At the end of Moses' ministry he once more reaffirmed its provisions, reminding them of the curses pronounced on all who should disobey its provisions, and adding, as an additional memorial of the occasion, the sublime song contained in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>. (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19, 22</a>). Joshua was present on this occasion, and the dying lawgiver charged him to undertake the conquest of the premised land, and to maintain the observance of the law among the people of God. Hitherto, however, God's promise had not been fulfilled. It seems only natural that when Israel had obtained peaceful possession of the land sworn unto their fathers, and before they were left to His unseen guidance, they should once more be publicly reminded of the conditions on which they enjoyed the inheritance. It may be remarked that, although Joshua's addendum to the book of the law has not come down to us, yet that it covers the principle of such additions, and explains how, at the death of Moses, a brief account of his death and burial should be appended by authority to the volume containing the law itself. The last chapter of Deuteronomy is, in fact, the official seal set upon the authenticity of the narrative, as the words added here were the official record of the law of Moses, having been adopted as the code of jurisprudence in the land. <span class="cmt_word">And took a great stone</span> (see notes on Joshua 4:2, 9). An oak. Perhaps <span class="accented">the terebinth.</span> So the LXX. (see note on ver. 1). The tree, no doubt, under which Jacob had hid the teraphim of his household.

The stone was taken from the very place where they stood, and within earshot of the words which had been spoken. Thus it became a more forcible memorial of what had occurred than if it had been brought from far. Ye deny your God. To deny is to say that He is not. The Hebrew implies "to deny <span class="accented">concerning</span> Him," to contest the truth of what has been revealed of His essence, and to disparage or deny the great things He had done for His people. The whole scene must have been a striking one. The aged warrior, full of years and honours, venerable from his piety and courage and implicit obedience, addresses in the measured, perhaps tremulous, accents of age the representatives of the whole people he has led so long and so well. Around him are the ancient memories of his race. Here Abraham pitched his tent in his wanderings through Canaan. Here was the first altar built to the worship of the one true God of the land. Here Jacob had buried the teraphim, and solemnly engaged his household in the worship of the true God. Here was the second foothold the children of Abraham obtained in the promised land (see ver. 32), a foretaste of their future inheritance. The bare heights of Ebal soared above them on one side, the softer outlines of Gerizim rose above them on the other; and on their sides, the plaster fresh and the letters distinct and clear, were to be seen the blessings and the curses foretold of those who kept and those who broke the law. In the midst, Shechem, in a situation, as we have seen, of rare beauty, bore witness to the fulfilment of God's promise that the land of their inheritance should be "a good land," a "land flowing with milk and honey." No other place could combine so many solemn memories; none could more adequately remind them of the fulness of blessing God had in store for those who would obey His word; none could be fitter to impress upon them the duty of worshipping God, and Him alone. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:29-33.

It is a fair specimen of the inventive criticism which has found favour among modern critics, in which a large amount of imagination is made to supply the want of the smallest modicum of fact. What is wanting here is the slightest evidence of such a "period" having ever existed, except at the time when these saints of the old covenant closed their labours by death. All the facts before us go to prove that Moses, as well as Joshua, was held in as high, if not higher, veneration at the moment of his death as at any other period of Jewish history. <span class="cmt_word">Died</span>. His was an end which any man might envy. Honoured and beloved, and full of days, he closed his life amid the regrets of a whole people, and with the full consciousness that he had discharged the duties God had imposed upon trim.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a></div><div class="verse">And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which <i>is</i> in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah.</span> Rather, perhaps, <span class="accented">within</span> the border. For Timnath-Serah, see note on Joshua 19:50. The burial-place of Joshua has been supposed to be identified by the Palestine Exploration Committee. Lieutenant Conder describes what he saw at Tibneh. Amid a number of tombs he found one evidently, from more than 200 lamp niches on the walls of the porch, the sepulchre of a man of distinction. The simple character of the ornamentation, he thinks, and the entire absence of it in the interior of the tomb itself, not only suggest an early date, but are in harmony with the character of the simple yet noble-minded warrior, whose tomb it is supposed to be (see Quart. Paper, oct. 1873). In later papers, however (see Oct. 1877, and Jan. 1878), Lieutenant Conder abandons Tibneh for Kerr Haris, on the ground that Jewish tradition, usually found to be correct, is in its favour. And more mature reflection has induced him to modify his former opinion as to the early date of the tombs. Until these researches commenced, the situation of the hill Gaash was unknown, though it is mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/23-30.htm">2 Samuel 23:30</a> ("the brooks" or "valleys of Gaash"), and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/11-32.htm">1 Chronicles 11:32</a>. Nothing in these places serves to identify it. This passage is copied, with a few minute verbal discrepancies, into the Book of Judges (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6-9</a>), a strong ground, according to all ordinary haws of literary criticism, for concluding that the latter book was written after the former. This is the chain of evidence by which the authenticity of the historical books of the Scriptures is established, not, of course, beyond the reach of cavil or dispute, but to the satisfaction of practical men. The LXX. as well as the Arabic translators have added here the following words: "There they placed with him in the sepulchre, in which they buried him there, the stone knives with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal, when he led them out from Egypt, as the Lord commanded, and they are there unto this day." This passage is not found in the Hebrew. And as the Arabic and the LXX. do not altogether agree, the probability seems to be that some apocryphal legend was inserted here at a very early date. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/24-31.htm">Joshua 24:31</a></div><div class="verse">And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Israel served the Lord</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>). We see here the value of personal influence. Nor is such influence altogether unnecessary among us now. The periods of great religious movements in the Christian Church are in many ways very like to the time of the Israelitish conquest of Palestine by Joshua. They are times when God visibly fights for His Church, when miracles of grace are achieved, when the enemies of God are amazed and confounded at the great things God has done. The successes, so clearly due to the interposition of a Higher Power, have a sobering rather than an intoxicating effect, and the influence of the grave, wise, earnest men at the head of the movement is great with their enthusiastic followers. But with the removal of these leaders in Israel a reaction sets in. The fervour of the movement declines, the era of slackness and compromise succeeds, and a generation arises which "knows not the Lord, nor yet the works which He had done for Israel." In our times such reactions, living as we do in the full blaze of gospel light, are far more transient and less fatal than in the days of Israel. But in our measure we continue to experience the working of that law by which intense energy is apt to be followed by coldness, and every earnest movement for good needs a continual rekindling at the altar of God of the fire which first set it at work. <span class="cmt_word">That overlived Joshua.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">that lengthened out their days after</span> Joshua. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the bones of Joseph</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/50-24.htm">Genesis 50:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>). Nothing could more fully show the reverence in which the name of Joseph was held in Israel than this scrupulous fulfilment of his commands, and the careful record of it in the authentic records of the country. This passage is another link in the chain of evidence which serves to establish the authenticity and early date of the present hook. For though Joseph's name was always a striking one in Israelitish history, it is unquestionable that as time went on his fame was overshadowed by that of his ancestors. It is Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob on whom the national mind was fixed. It is their names that the prophets recall, the covenant with them which is constantly brought to mind. But during the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt, and while the departure from Egypt was yet recent, the conspicuous position which Joseph occupied in Egyptian history could not fail to be remembered, and the command he gave concerning his bones, as well as his conviction that the prophecy concerning their departure would be fulfilled, was not likely to be forgotten. The emphatic way in which the fulfilment of Joseph's charge is here recorded affords a presumption for the early date of the book, as well as against the theory that it was a late compilation from early records. We are not necessarily to suppose that the interment of Joseph's remains took place at this period. The Hebrew, as we have seen, has no pluperfect tense (see for this <a href="../../par/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>), and therefore it may have taken place, and most probably did take place, as soon as Shechem was in the hands of Israel. In a parcel of ground. Rather, <span class="accented">in the portion of the field</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). Our word <span class="accented">parcel</span> is derived from <span class="accented">particula, and was</span> originally identical with the word <span class="accented">particle</span>, a little part. So Chaucer speaks of <span class="accented">parcel-</span>mele, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by parts. Shakespere has a "parcel-gilt goblet," that is, a goblet partly gilt. It has now come to have a widely different meaning. Pieces of silver. There can be little doubt that this is the true translation. The cognate word in Arabic, signifying "justice," is apparently derived from the idea of even scales. A kindred Hebrew word signifies "truth," probably from the same original idea. Another kindred Arabic word signifies a balance. It therefore, no doubt, means a coin of a certain weight, just as the word <span class="accented">shekel</span> has the original signification of weight. The Rabbinical notion, that the word signified "Iambs," rests upon no solid foundation, though supported by all the ancient versions. Some commentators, however, think that a coin is meant upon which the figure of a lamb was impressed. So Vatablus and Drusius.

The LXX., Syriac, and Vulgate translate this as a proper name, Gibeath or Gabaath Phineas. But it may also mean Phinehas' hill. A city may or may not have been built there. Keil and Delitzsch believe it to be the Levitical town, Geba of Benjamin; but of this we cannot be sure. The tomb of Eleazar is still shown near Shechem, "overshadowed by venerable terebinths," as Dean Stanley tells us. And so the history ends with the death and burial of the conqueror of Palestine, the lieutenant of Moses, the faithful and humble servant of God, and of the successor of Aaron, who had been solemnly invested with the garments of his father before that father's death. A fitting termination to so strange and marvellous a history. With the death of two such men a new era had begun for the chosen people; a darker page had now to be opened. The LXX. adds to this passage, "In that day the children of Israel took the ark and carried it about among them, and Phinehas acted as priest, instead of Eleazar his father, until he died, and was buried in his own property at Gabaath. And the children of Israel went each one to his place and to his own city. And the children of Israel worshipped Astarte and Ashtaroth, the gods of the nations around them. And the Lord delivered them into the hand of Eglon king of the Moabites, and he had dominion over them eighteen years." The passage is an obvious compilation from the Book of Judges. It has no counterpart in the Hebrew, and the mention of Astarte and Ashtaroth as different deities is sufficient to discredit it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../judges/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Judges 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Judges 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/2.htm"><title>Joshua 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/1.htm" title="Joshua 1">&#9668;</a> Joshua 2 <a href="../joshua/3.htm" title="Joshua 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.

It was "the long belt of acacia groves which mark with a line of verdure the upper terraces of the valley." (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 298). The word Abel, or meadow, signifying the long grass with its juicy moisture, points to it as a refreshing place of sojourn and pasture for flocks, after the weary wandering in the wilderness. The acacia, not the <span class="accented">spina AEgyptiaca</span> of the ancients, the <span class="accented">mimosa Nilotica</span> of Linnaeus, but the acacia Seyal, a tree with a golden tuft of blossom, which is still (Tristram, 'Land of Israel,' p. 524) to be found on the spot, very hard dark wood, of which much use was made in the tabernacle and its fittings (see <a href="../../par/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25, 26, 36, 37</a>, etc.). The name Abel was a common one in Palestine, and is the same as Abila, from whence comes Abilene (<a href="../../par/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>). We may add that it has nowhere been said that they <span class="accented">were</span> at Shittim. We find this out from <a href="../../par/numbers/25-1.htm">Numbers 25:1</a>. This undesigned coincidence is beyond the power of an inventor, and far beyond the power of a compiler who was not only untrustworthy, but so clumsy that he made the most extraordinary blunders in the management of his matter (see note on next verse, and also on Joshua 1:11). <span class="cmt_word">Two men.</span> <span class="accented">Young men</span>, as we are told in <a href="../../par/joshua/6-23.htm">Joshua 6:23</a>, and therefore active, fleet of foot as well as brave and prudent. All these qualities, as the subsequent narrative shows, were urgently required. "Joshua himself was full of God's Spirit, and had the oracle of God ready for his direction. Yet now he goes, not to the Propitiatorie for consultation, but to the spyes. Except where ordinarie meanes faile us, it is no use appealing to the immediate helpe of God; we may not seek to the posterne, but where the common gate is shut. It was promised Joshua that bee should leade Israel into the promised land, yet hee knew it was unsafe to presume. The condition of his provident care was included in that assurance of successe. Heaven is promised to us, but not to our carelessnesse, infidelitie, disobedience" (Bishop Hall). <span class="cmt_word">Secretly</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">dumbness</span> or <span class="accented">craftiness</span> (the noun being used adverbially), implying the silence and skill required for the task. He who knows how to he silent possesses one at least of the elements of success. The necessity of silence and secrecy may be inferred from <a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>. Keil, however, following the Masoretic punctuation, regards" secretly" as referring to the Israelites, and the spies as sent unknown to the army, that no depressing report might damp their courage. Jericho. "The city of fragrance" (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> to breathe, and in the Hiphil, to smell a sweet odour), so called from its situation in the midst of palm trees, from which it was called "the city of palm trees <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/34-3.htm">Deuteronomy 34:3</a>, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>. The vast palm grove, of which relics are even now occasionally washed up from the Red Sea, preserved by the salt in its acrid waters, has now disappeared. We read of it as still existing in the twelfth century, and indeed traces of it were to be seen as late as 1838. A dirty and poverty-stricken village called Riha, or Eriha, is all that now marks the site of all these glories of nature and art, and the most careful researches have until lately failed to discover any remains of the ancient city. It is doubtful whether the ruins observed by Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 216) are not the ruins of soma later city, built in the neighbourhood. Bartlett, p. 452, believes Riha to be the site of the later Jericho of our Lord's day, but Tristram would, with less probability, identify Riha with Gilgal. They both, however, place the site of ancient Jericho about a mile and a half from Riha. Conder thinks its true position is at the fountain Ain-es-Sultan. Lenormant, in his 'Manual of Oriental History,' remarks on the skill of Joshua as a military tactician. Whether he followed the advice of his experienced leader, or whether we are to attribute his success to special guidance from above, he certainly displayed the qualities of a consummate general. "Jericho," says Dean Stanley ('Sinai and Palestine,' p. 805), "stands at the entrance of the main passes from the valley of the Jordan into the interior of Palestine, the one branching off to the southwest towards Olivet, the other to the northwest towards Michmash, which commands the approach to Ai and Bethel. It was thus the key of Palestine to any invader from this quarter." He illustrates by <span class="accented">Chiavenna</span> (or the key city, from its situation), in Italy. Lenormant remarks that from an ordinary historical point of view the strategy of Joshua is worth notice. It was the practice ever followed by Napoleon, and, he adds, by Nelson also, to divide his enemies, and crush them in detail. Had Joshua advanced upon Palestine from the south, each success, as it alarmed, would have also united the various communities of the land, under their separate kings, by the sense of a common danger. Thus each onward step would have increased his difficulties, and exposed him, exhausted by continued efforts, to the assaults of fresh and also more numerous enemies, in a country which grew ever more easy to defend and more perilous to attack. But by crossing the Jordan and marching at once upon Jericho, he was enabled, after the capture of that city, to fall with his whole force first upon the cities of the south, and then on those of the north. The political condition of Palestine at that time (see Introduction) did not permit of a resistance by the whole force of the country under a single leader. A hasty confederation of the kings of the south, after the treaty with Gibeon, was overthrown by the rapid advance of Joshua and the battle of Beth-boron. By this success he was free to march with his whole army northward, against the confederation of tribes under the leadership of the king of Hazor, whom he overcame in the decisive battle of Merom. There is no hint given in the Scripture that in this strategy Joshua acted under the special guidance of the Most High. The probability is, that in this, as in all other of God's purposes effected through the agency of man, there is a mixture of the Divine and human elements, and that man's individuality is selected and guided as an instrument of God's purpose, which, in this instance, was the chastisement of the Canaanitish people, and the gift of the Holy Land as a possession to the descendants of Abraham. That Joshua was not indifferent to human means is shown by this very verse. <span class="cmt_word">Into a harlots house.</span> Many commentators have striven to show that this word simply means an innkeeper, an office which, as Dr. Adam Clarke proves at length, was often filled by a woman. It has been derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> to nourish, a root also found in the Syriac. The Chaldee paraphast and many Jewish and Christian interpreters have adopted this interpretation, in order, as Rosenmuller remarks, "to absolve her from whom Christ had His origin from the crime of prostitution." But St. Matthew seems to imply the very opposite. The genealogy there contained mentions, as though of set purpose, all the blots on the lineage of Christ as was fitting in setting forth the origin of Him who came to forgive sin. Only three women are there mentioned: Tamar, who was guilty of incest; Rahab, the harlot; and Ruth, the Moabitess. And the LXX. render by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>. Calvin calls the interpretation "innkeeper" a "presumptuous wresting of Scripture." Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 197) also rejects the interpretation "innkeeper," and maintains the right of the spies, who, he says, were no doubt chosen by Joshua for their good character, to enter a wicked woman's house for a good purpose. It does not appear that the spies entered the house of Rahab with any evil intent, but simply because to enter the house of a woman of that kind - and women of that kind must have been very numerous in the licentious Phoenician cities - would have attracted far less attention than if they had entered any other. Even there it did not escape the notice of the king, who had been thoroughly alarmed (ver. 3) by the successes of Israel eastward of Jordan. Origen, in his third homily on Joshua, remarks that, "As the first Jesus sent his spies before him and they were received into the harlot's house, so the second Jesus sent His forerunners, whom the publicans and harlots gladly received." <span class="cmt_word">Named Rahab.</span> Origen (Hom. 3) sees in this name, which signifies <span class="accented">room</span> (see Rehoboth, <a href="../../par/genesis/26-22.htm">Genesis 26:22</a>), the type of the Church of Christ which extends throughout the world, and receives sinners. <span class="cmt_word">And lodged there.</span> Literally, and <span class="accented">lay</span> there, perhaps with the idea of lying hid, for they did not (ver. 15) spend the night there.

For, as Calvin remarks, Rahab would hardly have dared to lie so coolly had she not previously taken precautions to conceal her guests. And therefore she must have told a twofold falsehood. She must have discovered, or been made acquainted with, their errand, and therefore have "known whence they were," in addition to her assertion that she did not know where they were now. <span class="cmt_word">And hid them.</span> The original is remarkable and very vivid. <span class="accented">And hid him, i.e.</span>, each one in a separate place. No doubt the detail comes from an eyewitness, so that if the Book of Joshua he not a contemporary work, the writer must have had access to some contemporary document. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/2-5.htm">Joshua 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass <i>about the time</i> of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I wot not.</span> Much has Been said about Rahab's falsehood which is little to the point. The sacred historian simply narrates the fact, and makes no comment whatever upon it. But the fact that Rahab afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah, as the genealogy in St. Matthew informs us (though Knobel denies this, asserting that between Joshua and David there were more than three generations, forgetting that Boaz, when he married Ruth, was an old man, see <a href="../../par/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>), shows that neither her falsehood nor her mode of life excited much disapprobation among the Jews. Nor need this surprise us. There is no need, with Keil, to repudiate energetically the assertion of Hauff that the author of this Book regarded Rahab's deception as not only allowable, but praiseworthy, any more than we need scruple to confess that Jael's base treachery met with the approval of Deborah and Barak. The tone of feeling in Jewish society in Rahab's day must have differed enormously in many respects from what obtains in our own time, in the light of the dispensation of the Spirit. We may take, as an instance of what that tone of feeling was, even before Israel had been corrupted by their sojourn in Egypt, the narrative in <a href="../../par/genesis/38.htm">Genesis 38</a>. And we may be sure that in a Phoenician city the tone was many degrees lower still. Rahab, therefore, was no doubt absolutely ignorant that there was any sin, either in her mode of living or in the lie she told to save the men's lives. She acted from a twofold motive, and her course, both of thought and action, was a most surprising instance of faith and insight, in one brought up as she had been. She not only followed an instinct of humanity, at a time when human life was thought of little value, in preserving the lives of the men who had sought shelter under her roof, but she could discern in the wonderful successes of Israel the hand of a higher power than that of the gods whom she had been brought up to worship. In her subsequent conduct she betrayed an affection for her kindred somewhat uncommon in persons situated similarly to herself. And we may be sure, from the fact that she was chosen to be a "mother in Israel," that she forsook the sins of her country and her education as soon as she came within the range of a higher light (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-31.htm">Hebrews 11:31</a> and <a href="../../par/james/2-25.htm">James 2:25</a>). From what has been said we may learn that, though Rahab's faith was "as a grain of mustard seed," her conduct showed that she possessed it; and in hers, as in every case, to walk by the light she had was a sure prelude to the possession of more. And as regards her departure from truth here, it must be shown, before she can be blamed, that she had any idea that truthfulness was a duty. Such a duty does not appear to have been clearly recognised until He who was Himself the truth came among men. "However the guilt of Rahab's falsehood may be extenuated, it seems best to admit nothing which may tend to explain it away. We are sure that God discriminated between what was good in her conduct and what was bad; rewarding the former, and pardoning the latter. Her views of the Divine law must have been exceedingly dim and contracted. A similar falsehood, told by those who enjoy the light of revelation, however laudable the motive, would of course deserve a much heavier censure" (Matthew Henry). So also Calvin <span class="accented">in loc.,"</span> Vitium virtuti admistum non imputatur."

"Where cannot the God of heaven either find or raise up friends to His own causes and servants?" (Bp. Hall.) <span class="cmt_word">To the roof of the house.</span> The flat roofs of Oriental, and even of Greek and Italian houses, are used for all kinds of purposes, especially for drying corn and other things for domestic use (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>.

The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> which signifies <span class="accented">to lay in a row</span>, and is used of the wood on the altar in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9</a>, and of the shew bread in <a href="../../par/leviticus/24-6.htm">Leviticus 24:6</a>, confirms this view. It is obvious that this would have formed a most sufficient hiding place for the fugitives. "Either faith or friendship are not tried but in extremities. To show countenance to the messengers of God while the publique face of the State smiles upon them, is but a courtesie of course; but to hide our own lives in theirs when they are persecuted is an act which looks for a reward" (Bp. Hall).

One near Jericho (cf, <a href="../../par/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/12-5.htm">Judges 12:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22, 24</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-16.htm">2 Samuel 19:16, 19, 39</a>); one at Bethsean, now Beisan, leading to Succoth (<a href="../../par/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>. See Robinson, ' Biblical Researches' 2:497; Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine'); beside others not mentioned in Scripture. A vivid description of the crossing the Jordan at the fords near Jericho is to be found in Tristrain's 'Land of Israel,' p. 520. The ford is almost certainly the one mentioned here, since an hour or two's ride brought the party to Shittim. These fords were easy to cross save when the Jordan, as was now the case (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>), overflowed its banks. This may have been the reason why the pursuers did not cross the fords, but they pursued the spies to the fords, hoping to find their retreat cut off. This is rendered more probable by the fact (ver. 22) that the pursuers appear to have continued their search after leaving the fords.

Whether this name were known to her or not, she knew what was signified by it, the one only self-existent God (since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> is clearly derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>), the Author of all things, visible and invisible (see ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">The Red Sea.</span> Brugsch, in his 'History of Egypt,' denies that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> should be rendered 'Red Sea,' and affirms that this error of the LXX. interpreters has been the source of endless misapprehensions. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> is an Egyptian word signifying flags or rushes, which abound not only in the Red Sea, but in the marshes on the shores of the Mediterranean, as, in fact, in all low-lying lands. It is here, according to Brugsch, in a treacherous and well-nigh impassable country, near that Serbonian bog, "where armies whole have sunk" (Milton, 'Paradise Lost,' Book H., line 594), that we are to look for the victorious passage of <span class="accented">Moses</span>, and the destruction of Pharaoh and his host. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> or rushes were to be found in the Nile, as <a href="../../par/exodus/2-9.htm">Exodus 2:9, 5</a> shows (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a>). So that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> by no means necessarily implies the Red Sea. Yet on the other hand we may remember, with the Edinburgh Reviewer (July, 1879), that the coastline of Palestine and of the delta of the Nile has undergone considerable changes during the historic period, and that the land has, during that period, largely encroached on the sea. <span class="cmt_word">Sihon and Og.</span> As we read in <a href="../../par/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2, 3</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Whom ye utterly destroyed.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">devoted to utter destruction</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">And as soon as we had heard <i>these things</i>, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he <i>is</i> God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Melt.</span> The word in the Hebrew is a different one to that used in ver. 9, but it has a precisely similar meaning. There seems no reason why the destruction of Sihon and Og should have inspired such terror into the hearts of the powerful Phoenician tribes. But the miracle of the drying up of the Red Sea was an event of quite another order, and eminently calculated to produce such feelings. Nothing but such an occurrence could have explained Rahab's language, or the anxiety which the near approach of the armies of Israel inspired in those "cities, great and walled up to heaven," with their inhabitants of giant-like stature and strength. <span class="cmt_word">Courage</span>. Literally, <span class="accented">spirit.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span> seems to have been used in the Hebrew in just the same senses as our word <span class="accented">spirit</span>, and it signified <span class="accented">wind</span> also (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-5.htm">1 Kings 10:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord your God, he is God.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">for Jehovah your God.</span> This declaration, bearing in mind the circumstances of the person who uttered it, is as remarkable as St. Peter's, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." How Rahab attained to this knowledge of God's name and attributes we do not know. It is certain, however, that under the circumstances her knowledge and spiritual insight are as surprising as any recorded in Scripture, and are sufficient to explain the honour in which her name has been held, both at the time and ever since. "I see here," says Bp. Hall, "not only a disciple of God, but a prophetesse." Keil argues that Rahab regards God only as one of the gods, and supposes that she had not entirely escaped from polytheism. But this view does not appear to be borne out by the form of her expressions. We should rather, in that case, have expected to find "he is among the gods," than He is God, which is the only possible rendering of the Hebrew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:12-25. THE OATH OF THE SPIES. - 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/2-12.htm">Joshua 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> ? <span class="cmt_word">Kindness.</span> The original is perhaps a little stronger, and involves usually the idea of mercy and pity. This, however, is not always the case (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a>). "It had been an ill nature in Rahab if she had been content to be saved alone: that her love might be a match to her faith, she covenants for all her family, and so returns life to those of whom she received it," (Bp. Hall). <span class="cmt_word">A true token.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">a token of truth.</span> The construction is that in which the latter noun often stands in Hebrew for an adjective. Here, however, it would seem to be a little more, <span class="accented">a token of truth</span> - a pledge, that is, of sincerity. Rahab wanted some guarantee that her life and the lives of her kindred would be saved. The bare word of the spies would not suffice, for how could she and her kindred be identified in the confusion attending the sack of the city? But if the spies would agree upon some sign by which she could be recognised, it would at once be a pledge that they intended to keep their word, and a means of protection in the approaching downfall of the city.

There is no reason to suppose the window by which she let them down. to have been so distant from the ground as to preclude a conversation, and it is quite possible that Rahab's house may have been in a situation in which such a conversation could be carried on without interruption. There are continental cities now surrounded by walls, in which such a conversation would involve no difficulty whatever, especially if the house from which such a conversation was carried on happened to stand a little apart from other houses. And though the spies sent by Moses described the walls of the Phoenician cities in hyperbolical language, it is highly improbable that their fortifications were stronger than those of mediaeval times. The little town of Ahrweiler, in the valley of the Ahr, near Remagen, may serve as an instance in point. It would once have been called a strongly fortified town, but the walls are of no great height, and the houses are built upon them. The same may be seen at Bacharach and Oberwesel, and other well known places where the fortifications have not been modernised. With the escape of the spies we may compare the escape of St. Paul from Damascus, as recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-32.htm">2 Corinthians 11:32, 33</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/2-16.htm">Joshua 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Get you to the mountains.</span> No hint is given <span class="accented">why</span> the mountains were to be so safe a refuge. But a reference to the geography of the district will supply the reason. Any mountain district is usually less accessible and less thickly inhabited than the plains. But within five miles of Jericho lay the remarkable range called Quarantania, or Kuruntul, which is literally honeycombed with caves, so that a man might be concealed for months in the immediate neighbourhood of Jericho with a very slight risk of discovery. It is obvious how strongly this fact confirms the accuracy of the narrative. An inventor would have been certain in some way or other to draw attention to a statement intended to give an air of probability to his narrative. But there is nothing of the kind here, and yet the narrative displays a thorough acquaintance with the geographical features of the neighbourhood. Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 207, <span class="accented">sqq</span>.) carefully explored the caverns. On one face of the rock, which is perpendicular, he found "some thirty or forty habitable caves," and on the southern face, towards Jericho, he supposed there were a good many more than this. The scouts of the king of Jericho might be excused a very diligent search, for we are told that the "foot hold was hazardous and the height dizzy." From the days of the spies till long after the Christian era, these caves have been in existence. They have been tenanted by Greek, Syrian, and even Abyssinian monks, and Canon Tristram found many Greek and Ethiopic inscriptions, as well as figures of our Lord and the saints. The Abyssinian Christians make a yearly pilgrimage there even now. The reason of the reverence in which the place is held, is the tradition (not, however, eight hundred years old, see Bitter, 3:37) that, as the name Quarantania implies, the forty days' fast of our Lord took place there. As a specimen of the mystical interpretations in which the Fathers indulged, we find Origen expounding the advice, "Get you to the mountains," as follows: "Humilia et dejecta refugite, quae excelsa sunt et sublimia, praedicate."

This line of scarlet thread is regarded by the Fathers generally, and by our own divines, as Bishop Hall and Bishop Wordsworth, as symbolical of the blood of Christ (see Clement of Rome, 'Epistle to Corinthians,' 12; Justin Martyr, 'Dial. Tryph.' 111; Iren., 'Adv. Haer.,' 4:37; Orig., 'Hom. 2 on Joshua.' "Coccineum, quod sanguinis formam gerebat." See also Bp.

"This newes is brought but overnight, Joshua is on his way by morning, and prevents the sunne for haste. Delays, whether in the business of God or our owne, are hatefull and prejudiciall. Many a one loses the land of promise by lingering; if we neglect God's time, it is just with Him to crosse us in ours" (Bp. Hall). <span class="cmt_word">And they removed from Shittim.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">from the acacias</span> (<span class="accented">see</span> note on Joshua 2:1). To do this completely, and to be quite ready for the crossing, would, as Rosenmuller thinks, require the greater part of three days. But it adds that "they lodged (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>) there before they passed over." But this need be no difficulty. The great mass of the people could easily leave the acacia meadows on the higher ground, and encamp on the brink of the Jordan, while the remaining two days might be spent in making the necessary arrangements for the crossing. For we must remember (as Keil observes) that, not only a body of armed men, but their women and children, and all their possessions, had to be led safely across. "Though they were not told how they should pass the river, yet they went forward in faith, having been told (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>), that they should pass it" (Matthew Henry). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-2.htm">Joshua 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The officers.</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="../../par/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). This is evidently the history of the fulfilment of the command there given by Joshua. There he orders the officers to pass through the host; here the command is fulfilled. There is no reasonable doubt that the spies had returned before the order recorded in <a href="../../par/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a> had been given. Many commentators have raised objections to the order of the narrative in this and in the following chapter; and commentators like Houbigant, Masius (who says, "Narrationis ordo admodum perturbatus"), and Bishop Horsley, have suggested a different order of the verses. But Delitzsch has observed that the narrative is drawn up in a threefold order. First, the commencement of the crossing is detailed, from vers. 7-17 of this chapter; then (<a href="../../par/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1-14</a>), its further progress; lastly (<a href="../../par/joshua/4-15.htm">Joshua 4:15-24</a>), its conclusion.

We need not suppose (he adds) that each separate act was enjoined at the moment when the necessity for the injunction arrived. Nor, we may add, is it necessary to suppose that every intimation given by God to Joshua is necessarily recorded in chronological order (see note on Joshua 2:1.) We are only to understand by the order followed by the sacred historian, that he desires to impress fully upon his readers how entirely every step taken by Joshua was taken at the express command of God. The idea of Paulus, Eichhorn, Ewald, Knobel, and others, that this account is compiled from two or more different documents, would not only require us to suppose great clumsiness in the compiler, if their view of his work be true, but is wholly unnecessary. The text involves no contradictions; only an amount of repetition, which is an essential feature of all the early Hebrew historical narratives, as is evident to the most casual observer, and is a proof, not of compilation, but of the antiquity of the document, and the simplicity and absence of art of the writer. Ewald has remarked that it is characteristic of the Hebrew historians to mention the termination of the event as soon as possible, and then to fill in their outline by the narration of intermediate circumstances (see chs. 1, 3, 6, 7. of the Book of Joshua). As a specimen of the way in which contradictions are manufactured, we may take Knobel's assertion that the two statements that the people came to Jordan, and that there was a space of 2,000 cubits between them and the priests, are irreconcilable. As though it were not possible that the 2,000 cubits were to be measured <span class="accented">along the river</span>, and that the priests were ordered to walk along the bank until it was signified to them that they had arrived at the place of crossing. For we are plainly told that this distance was to be preserved that the people might "know the way which they must go" (ver. 4). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they commanded the people, saying.</span> These words are interesting as showing that all was orderly in the Israel-irish camp. Everything was carried on according to the strictest rules of military discipline. The removal of the ark was to be the signal for the advance of the whole host. <span class="cmt_word">The ark of the covenant.</span> We may with advantage compare the <span class="accented">religious</span> use of the ark here and in ch. 6, with its <span class="accented">superstitious</span> use in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3, 4</a>. We do not read that when the Israelites were defeated at Ai, Joshua took the ark with him in a march to repair the disaster. Such a misuse of the symbol of God's Presence was only possible in days when faith had grown cold. When the Israelites had need of supernatural guidance, when they were placed in circumstances where no use of their own unaided powers could guide them, <span class="accented">then</span> they must repair to the ark of God. There they must seek counsel, this they must set before them to guide their ways. But to regard it as a charm which could possibly atone for their want of faith and their lack of obedience, was to profane it. Such temptations as these Jesus Christ resisted in the wilderness; such temptations Christians must resist now. We have no right to seek for supernatural aids where natural ones will suffice us - no right to invoke the special intervention of God till we have exhausted all the means He has placed at our disposal. Above all, we have no right to expect Him to save us from the consequences of our own sin and disobedience except on His own condition, that we shall truly repent. We may further remark that the Pillar of the Cloud and the fire, like the manna, had ceased, and even the ark of the covenant only preceded the Israelites on special occasions. <span class="cmt_word">The priests the Levites.</span> This phrase has given rise to some discussion. Some editions of the LXX., as well as some Hebrew MSS., read, "the priests <span class="accented">and</span> the Levites." The Chaldee and Syriac versions have the same reading. The Vulgate - more correctly, as it would seem - renders "sacerdotes stirpis Levitiae," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "the priests who are of the tribe of Levi" (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-33.htm">Joshua 8:33</a>, <a href="../../par/numbers/4-18.htm">Numbers 4:18</a>, and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>). Keil's explanation that this expression must be taken in opposition to non-Levitical and, therefore, unlawful priests, seems hardly satisfactory. It is not till much later - in fact, till the time of Jeroboam - that we hear of unlawful priests. It is more probable that it is intended to emphasise the position of Levi as the sacerdotal tribe, the one tribe which had no share in the operations of the war. So Rabbi Solomon Jarchi explains it, citing the B'reshith Babbah, which states that the phrase is found in forty-five places in the Bible, with the meaning that the priests are of the tribe of Levi. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-4.htm">Joshua 3:4</a></div><div class="verse">Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed <i>this</i> way heretofore.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There shall be a space between you and it.</span> Perhaps in order that they might keep it in view. This agrees best with the remainder of the verse, "that ye may know the way by which ye must go." Keil remarks that, had the Israelites pressed close on the heels of the priests who bore the ark, this would have defeated the very object with which the ark was carried before the people, namely, to point them out the way that they should go. But Cornelius Lapide among the earlier commentators and Knobel among the moderns hold that it was the sacredness of the ark which rendered it necessary that there should be a space of more than half a mile between it and the Israelites. Jarchi says the space was "in honour of God." We may learn hence that irreverent familiarity with sacred things is not the best way to obtain guidance in the way in which God would have us walk. "What awfull respects doth God require to be given unto the testimony of His presence? Uzzah paid deare for touching it; the men of Bethshemesh for looking into it. It is a dangerous thing to bee too bold with the ordinances of God" (Bp. Hall). "Neither was it onely for reverence that the arke must be wayted on afarre, but for convenience" (<span class="accented">Ibid.</span>). "The work of ministers is to hold forth the word of life, and to take care of the administration of those ordinances which are the tokens of God's presence and the instruments of His power and grace, and herein they must go before the people of God in their way to heaven" (Matthew Henry <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). (Cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19, 20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6, 7</a>; also <a href="../../par/exodus/19-21.htm">Exodus 19:21</a>.) The original here is more emphatic than the translation. "Only there shall be a distance (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;</span>) between you and it." <span class="cmt_word">Ye have not passed this way heretofore.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">ye have not crossed since yesterday, the third day.</span> Paulus would translate this "lately," and thus get rid of the miracle, regarding it as an intimation that they were crossing at one of the fords. But they had not crossed the Jordan <span class="accented">at all</span> before. Consequently the translation <span class="accented">lately</span> is inadmissible. And even if they had been crossing Jordan by one of the fords, there is, as we have seen, a wide difference between crossing at the ford in ordinary times and crossing it when Jordan had overflowed its banks. This is a fair sample of the criticism which seeks to explain away miracles, as well as finds discrepancies where there are none.

We learn from ver. 7, though it is not expressly stated, that the actual crossing took place the next day. We ought, probably, to place this verse in a parenthesis, and to translate "Joshua had said," because the sanctification (see <a href="../../par/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10, 14</a>) involved some definite period.

We may observe that, while among the Canaanites all was terror and confusion, m the camp of Joshua all was confidence and faith. "Either successe or discomfiture begins ever at the heart. A man's inward disposition doth more than presage the event. If Satan see us once faint, he gives himselfe the day. There is no way to safety, but that our hearts be the last that shall yield" (Bp. Hall).

The phrase is a very common one as applied to God in the Old Testament. In the New, Christ is frequently referred to as the source of life. <span class="cmt_word">Is among you.</span> The original is stronger, <span class="accented">in the midst of you. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The Canaanites.</span> The descendants of Canaan, the son of Ham (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-18.htm">Genesis 9:18</a>). The word which signifies "low" is by some supposed to signify the same as lowlanders, because the Canaanites inhabited the less mountainous portions of Palestine, by the sea (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a>), and by the side of Jordan (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>). According to Ewald, their territory extended along the west bank of the Jordan as far as the Mediterranean Sea. Canaan has also been held to signify <span class="accented">bowed down, depressed</span> (see <a href="../../par/genesis/9-25.htm">Genesis 9:25</a>). But St. Augustine, in his exposition of the Epistle to the Romans (sec. 13), says that the country folk of the neighbourhood of Carthage, a Phoenician colony, as the name <span class="accented">Punic</span> implies, called themselves <span class="accented">Canani</span>, which they would hardly have done were the name a badge of servitude. Whether we are to attach much importance to this statement or <span class="accented">not</span>, it is certainly a <span class="accented">remarkable</span> coincidence. The story told by Procopius ('DeBello Vandalico, 2:10; see also Suidas, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) of two pillars of white stone near Tangier, with the inscription in Phoenician, "We are those who fled from the face of the robber Joshua, the son of Nun," is obviously not to be depended upon. Even if the inscription existed it was not likely to be of ancient date And as Kenrick remarks ('Phoenicia,' p. 67), those who erected the pillars were not likely <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to represent themselves as fugitives, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to speak of Joshua as the "son of Nun." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He further remarks that, while the oldest genuine Phoenician inscription is not more than four hundred years before Christ, this, if genuine, must have been erected nearly a thousand years earlier still; and he further observes on the impossibility of its having been deciphered by the scholars of Justinian's day. The stow, no doubt, had its origin in the Rabbinical tradition, mentioned by Jarchi in his Commentary, as well as by Kimchi, that Joshua grote three letters to the Canaanites before invading Palestine: the first inviting them to make peace; the second, on their refusal, proclaiming war; the third, to those who feared the wrath of Jehovah, warning them to depart <span class="accented">to Africa -</span> advice which, Jarchi adds, was actually taken by a great many. Concerning these seven nations more will be found in the Introduction (see also <a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15-18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>, dec.). That a Hebrew signification is found for Phoenician words need not surprise us. The descendants of Ham, when "dwelling in the tents of Shem," might have formed for themselves a similar language. But that the Aramaic, which was spoken throughout Syria and Palestine, was closely similar to the Hebrew, we have overwhelming evidence. Not only is there clear proof that Abraham and the Canaanites spoke the same language, not only are all the ancient names of places and persons of Hebrew origin, but even the Carthaginian language is <span class="accented">pronounced by</span> Jerome, a competent judge, to be cognate to the Hebrew (see Havernick, Introduction, see. 21). <span class="cmt_word">The Hittites.</span> The Hittites (Hebrew, Chittim) were out of all proportion the principal tribe in Palestine at this time, as we have already seen (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-4.htm">Joshua 1:4</a>). They were the descendants of Heth or Chet (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-15.htm">Genesis 10:15</a>), who dwelt in the neighbourhood of Hebron in the days of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9</a>). At that time they do not appear to have attained the importance which they afterwards reached (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/13-7.htm">Genesis 13:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>), though this is perhaps not altogether a safe inference (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/1-4.htm">Judges 1:4, 5</a>). For the mention of the Canaanites in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> <span class="accented">without</span> the Perizzite might lead to a similar inference with regard to the relative importance of these two tribes, whereas in the other two passages they appear on a level. Be this as it may, we find the Hittites occupying a prominent position in Canaan at this time, not only in the Book of Joshua, but on the Egyptian monuments, "Before the exodus the Kheta had become the terrible rivals of Egypt, and had mingled their genealogy with that of the renowned Pharaohs of the nineteeth dynasty" (Tomkins's 'Studies on the Times of Abraham,' p. 89). It is worthy of remark, however, that on the Egyptian monuments their leaders are spoken of as chieftains (see note on ch. 9:3, and 'Records of the Past,' 2:67-78). In later times they had attained to regal government (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-29.htm">1 Kings 10:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/1-17.htm">2 Chronicles 1:17</a>). It is, however, possible that the proud monarch of Egypt would not admit the petty kings of the Hittites to an equality with himself (see also note on Joshua 1:4). Moses connects the Chittim (<a href="../../par/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/23-1.htm">Isaiah 23:1</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>), or the inhabitants of Cyprus, with the Hittites. Since these words were written an able article appeared in <span class="accented">The Times</span> of Jan. 23rd, 1880, on the Hittite Empire. Carchemish, on the Euphrates, and Kadesh, or the Holy City, on the Orontes, appear to have been the chief centres of the Hittite power. They were "powerful enough to threaten Assyria on the one hand and Egypt on the other, and to carry the arts and culture of the Euphrates to the Euxine and AEgean seas." Professor F. W. Newman, finding no mention of their existence in profane histories, came to the usual conclusion of his school, that where the Bible mentioned persons or nations and profane history did not, it was quite clear that such persons or nations never existed. The cases of Sargon and the Hittites may perhaps induce critics of this school to be a little less hasty henceforth in dismissing the statements of Scripture. The site of ancient Carchemish has lately been discovered on the western bank of the Euphrates. <span class="cmt_word">The Hivites,</span> or rather <span class="accented">Hivrites.</span> The name of this tribe is not found in the first enumeration of the nations of Canaan (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>), but we find the name in the list of Canaan's descendants in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-17.htm">Genesis 10:17</a> and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1-15.htm">1 Chronicles 1:15</a>. Shechem, the prince of the city of that name, was a Hivite (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), though some copies of the LXX. read Horite for Hivite without authority. The Hivites then (<a href="../../par/genesis/34-10.htm">Genesis 34:10-21</a>) seem, as afterwards in the case of the Gibeonites, to have been a peaceful, commercial race. The character of the Shechemites afterwards seems to have been unwarlike. At least they were neither very spirited nor successful in their military enterprises, as the narrative in <a href="../../par/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>. shows. The voluptuous beauty of the place, testified to by so many modern travellers, such as Robinson, Vandevelde, etc., falls in well with the character of the inhabitants. A colony of Hivites seem to have dwelt in the north, in the highlands beneath Mount Hermon, a country to which the name of Mizpeh, or <span class="accented">watchtower</span>, seems to have been given, no doubt from its elevation. This must not, however, be confounded with Mizpeh in the land of Benjamin (see <a href="../../par/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a> they appear to have been found in the neighbourhood of Tyre, though this is by no means clear. The derivation of the word is uncertain. Ewald would explain it "midlander;" Gesenius explains it by "village," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> to live, breathe. That <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> signifies a town or village we may learn from <a href="../../par/numbers/32-41.htm">Numbers 32:41</a>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, <a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>, <a href="../../par/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>, I Kings 4:13. The mention of their city so early as the time of Jacob, the description given of their character in that narrative, and the characteristic astuteness of the Gibeonites as well as their unwarlike conduct, would lead to the conclusion that they dwelt in settled habitations, not nomadic encampments, and that they gained their living chiefly by commerce. We ought not to quit the subject without the remark that all we learn from Scripture concerning the Hivites is remarkably consistent, and bears testimony to the scrupulous accuracy of the writers. <span class="cmt_word">The Perizzites.</span> The word Perizzite signifies countryman, as distinguished from the dwellers in houses. Thus the word signifies "unwalled," or "open," in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>, <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a>, and in the Keri of <a href="../../par/esther/9-19.htm">Esther 9:19</a>. Perhaps the reason of the omission of their name in <a href="../../par/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a>. and <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/1.htm">1 Chronicles 1</a>. may justify the supposition that they were of no particular tribe, but were a collection of men from every tribe engaged in agricultural pursuits. Redslob (see art. in 'Dictionary of the Bible ') suggests that the Hawoth (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a>) were pastoral, the Perazoth agricultural villages. This is to a certain extent borne out by the fact that Hawoth signifies "living places," and Perazoth" places spread out," as well as by the fact that the trans-Jordanic tribes were specially pastoral in their habits. Passages such as <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/14-11.htm">1 Chronicles 14:11</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/28-21.htm">Isaiah 28:21</a> are cited as illustrative of this word, but erroneously, for in the Hebrew the letter is Tzade, and not Zain, as here. Ritter regards the word as analogous to Pharisee, from <span class="accented">pharash</span>, to separate, and regards them as nomad tribes. But the authority of Ewald and Gesenius must outweigh his. <span class="cmt_word">The Girgashites.</span> They are not mentioned in Scripture, save in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-11.htm">Joshua 24:11</a>, <a href="../../par/genesis/15-21.htm">Genesis 15:21</a>, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>. They were therefore no doubt a small tribe, in. habiting, it has been supposed, the country of Gergesa or Gerasa (as some editions read in <a href="../../par/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a>) upon the lake of Genne-sareth. But this was on the other side of Jordan. If therefore there be any connection between Gergesa or Gerasa and the Girgashites, there must have been a small settlement of them on the eastern side of the lake of Gennesareth. <span class="cmt_word">The Amorites.</span> These were the most powerful of the Canaanitish peoples (see <a href="../../par/amos/2-9.htm">Amos 2:9</a>). They not only inhabited the mountains (<a href="../../par/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), but crossed the Jordan and wrested the country from Arnon to Jabbok out of the hands of the Moabites (<a href="../../par/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13, 24, 26</a>), and dwelt there until dispossessed by Moses. In <a href="../../par/genesis/14-9.htm">Genesis 14:9</a> we find them west of Jordan, near Engedi, on the shores of the Dead Sea. Thence crossing Jordan they seem to have spread eastward. They are found in the Shephelah, on the borders of Dan (<a href="../../par/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>), and even in the mountain district near Ajalon. But (ver. 35) they seem to have been driven out of Judah, and to have occupied a small portion of the Arabah south of the Dead Sea (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>). Ewald, as well as Gesenius, regards the word Amorite as signifying highlander, and he quotes <a href="../../par/isaiah/17-9.htm">Isaiah 17:9</a>, where Amir signifies the highest part of anything, as of a tree. So the Syriac Amori signifies a hero, and the Arabic Emir signifies a ruler. With this we may compare the term Ameer of Afghanistan, no doubt derived from a similar root.

This would suggest that the words applied to the inhabitants were to a great extent convertible terms, just as we apply the term Celt, Gael, Highlander indiscriminately to the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, Dutchman and Hollander to the inhabitants of Holland, and as Scotus and Erigena were both applied to Irishmen up to the 10th century. <span class="cmt_word">The Jebusites</span> were in possession of the central highlands around Jerusalem, their stronghold.

The Israelites needed to be reminded of this to support them during the crossing of the Jordan. The translation of the LXX., though rejected by the Masorites, who separate the words "covenant" and "Lord," is admissible here, "the covenant of the Lord of all the earth." If we follow the Masoretic punctuation, we must supply the word "ark" again, and translate "the ark of the covenant, the ark of the Lord of the whole earth."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a></div><div class="verse">And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, <i>that</i> the waters of Jordan shall be cut off <i>from</i> the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord, the Lord of all the earth.</span> The original is, <span class="accented">Jehovah, the Lord of all the earth<span class="cmt_word">.</span> That the waters of Jordan shall be cut off.</span> The construction here seems to have perplexed the LXX., Vulgate, and English translators. The former have given the sense, but have changed the construction. The second have supposed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> to mean <span class="accented">fail</span>, and to refer to the waters <span class="accented">below</span> the place of crossing. The third have interpolated the word "from." The words "the waters descending from above" are in apposition to, and explanatory of, the words "the waters" above. If for "from" in our version we substitute "namely," we shall express the meaning of the original. The Masorites point thus, dividing the verb from what follows by Zakeph Katon<span class="cmt_word">. A heap</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/38-7.htm">Psalm 38:7</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brim.</span> The water's edge is meant here, as in ver. 8, where the same word is translated <span class="accented">brink</span> (see note on ver. 17, and on Joshua 4:19). <span class="cmt_word">Jordan overfloweth all his banks.</span> Some commentators translate here, <span class="accented">filleth all his banks</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, LXX.). But this rendering is contrary <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to the Hebrew, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> contrary to fact. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The literal rendering here is, "filleth <span class="accented">out</span> (or <span class="accented">upon</span>) all its banks." In ch. 4:18 we read that Jordan goeth <span class="accented">over</span> all its banks And that the Jordan is not merely full, but full to overflowing, at the harvest season, is proved by the statements of many travellers. Take, for instance, Canon Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 223), who describes his visit to the Jordan as occurring just after it had been overflowing its banks, and the lower level of the valley as filled with "a deep slimy ooze." He adds that, by measure merit, the river was found to have been fourteen feet above the level at which he found it, and it was then quite full. Bartlett ('From Egypt to Palestine,' p. 451) remarks, "We were fortunate enough to see it in the state in which it is described in Joshua, 'overflowing all its banks' - that is, the whole line of its banks. The turbid stream rushed along like a mill race, and though it had fallen from its greatest height, the proper banks of the channel were invisible, and indicated only by lines of oleanders and other shrubs and trees." This was on the 22nd of March. This overflowing is caused by the melting of the snows of Hermon, which then rush down, fill Lake Huleh and its marshes, as well as Gennesareth, and cause the "swelling of Jordan" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>; 1:44), which drives the wild beasts from their retreats on its banks (see also <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-15.htm">1 Chronicles 12:15</a>). Some travellers have boldly asserted, in spite of this concurrent testimony, that Jordan does not overflow its banks at the time of harvest. But they have mistaken the wheat for the barley harvest, forgetting that in Palestine the latter precedes the former by six or seven weeks. By the time of wheat harvest Jordan has returned to its normal condition, and all traces of the inundation have passed away (see Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' pp. 618-621). <span class="cmt_word">The time of harvest,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the barley harvest, which took place about the 10th Nisan, or Abib, when the Israelites crossed. The wheat harvest was about Pentecost, or seven weeks later (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>). An important argument for the genuineness of the narrative (and much the more important as its chief incident is miraculous) is drawn from this passage by Blunt in his 'Undesigned Coincidences.' He remarks that in <a href="../../par/exodus/9-31.htm">Exodus 9:31, 33</a> the barley and flax are said to have ripened together. Therefore the time of the barley and flax harvest would be identical. Accordingly we have Rahab, three days before the event here recorded, in possession of the as yet undried stalks of flax which had just been cut. Nothing could be a more satisfactory proof that the narrative we have before us comes from persons who were accurately and minutely informed concerning the circumstances of which they tell us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">That the waters which came down from above stood <i>and</i> rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that <i>is</i> beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea, failed, <i>and</i> were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stood and rose up upon a heap.</span> Literally, "stood - they rose up, one heap." The narrative assumes a poetic form here (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-27.htm">Judges 5:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Very far from the city Adam.</span> The Masorites have corrected the text here. The original text has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for which the suggested Keri is <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span>. But the correction is needless. It is better to render, "they rose up, one heap, very far off, at the city Adam." The city Adam is nowhere else mentioned in Scripture, The LXX. appears to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;</span>, for it translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. This reading of the LXX. shows that the correction, though it obscures the sense, is of great antiquity, and that the site of Adam was then quite unknown. Knobel would place it either just south of the Jabbok, where the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span> now exists, or at <span class="accented">Eduma</span>, now <span class="accented">Daumeh</span>, twelve German miles east of Neapolis. The former is generally accepted now, and Conder ('Handbook,' p. 241) identifies it with Admah (see <a href="../../par/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>), in the plain or ciccar of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">That is beside Zaretan.</span> Called Zarthan in the original (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-46.htm">1 Kings 7:46</a>), and Zeredatha, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-17.htm">2 Chronicles 4:17</a>. Some read Zeredatha for Zererath in <a href="../../par/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>. Knobel supposes, and not without some probability, that Zereda, Jeroboam's birthplace, is the same as this. It was in the plain of Jordan, not far from Succoth, at the mouth of the Jabbok. The LXX. here reads <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, either Kiriathaim or Kirjath-jearim, but without authority. Delitzsch and Knobel suppose the spot to be Kurn, or Karn (<span class="accented">i.e., horn</span>) Sartabeh, near the ford <span class="accented">Damieh</span>, where the Jordan valley is at its narrowest, and the rocks stretch forward so as almost to meet. They fix on this spot, partly from the suitability of the situation for such an arresting of the waters, partly from its agreement with the situation of Zarthan, as described in the Scriptures. Vandevelde agrees with them. There was an Adami and a Zartanath higher up the river near Bethshean, which some have supposed to be meant (see Joshua 19:83; <a href="../../par/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), but these lay entirely out of Joshua's line of march. <span class="cmt_word">The sea of the plain.</span> Rather the sea of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;</span>, LXX.), or desert (so <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; see also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>). The term is applied by the Hebrews and Arabs to any sterile region, and thence to the sterile depression which borders on the Jordan, extending from the lake of Tiberias southward. The Arabs now apply the term <span class="accented">el ghor</span> to the part between Tiberias and the Dead Sea, and reserve the term Arabah for the desert valley, or wady, which extends thence to the Red Sea. So Gesen., 'Thesaurus,' s.v.; and Robinson, 'Bibl. Res.' The word translated <span class="accented">plain</span> in <a href="../../par/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, a word of very different signification (see also 'Shephelah' and 'Emek,' <a href="../../par/joshua/10-40.htm">Joshua 10:40</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/11-2.htm">Joshua 11:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The salt sea</span>. This sea is called the Dead Sea from the immobility of its waters, as well as from the apparent absence of all life within them. "Some of our party," says Canon Tristram," employed themselves in searching, but without avail, for life in the Dead Sea." It lies at a level of more than 1,300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its waters are thus described by Dr. Thomson: "The water is perfectly clear and transparent. The taste is bitter and salt, far beyond that of the ocean. It acts upon the tongue and mouth like alum; smarts in the eye like camphor; produces a burning, pricking sensation." The specific gravity of its waters is very great, and bathers find a great difficulty in swimming in it from the unusual buoyancy of the water. This is caused by the very large quantity of saline matter held in solution from the salt hills in the neighbourhood. One of them, Jebel Usdum, is described by Canon Tristram as "a solid mass of rock salt," and the water in its vicinity as "syrup of chloride of sodium," that is to say, of common salt. So also Bartlett, 'Egypt and Palestine,' p. 451. The statement that no bird can fly across its waters is a fable. The fullest account of the various attempts - some of them fatal - to explore the Dead Sea are to be found in Ritter's 'Geography of Palestine,' vol. 3. Canon Tristram explored the western side thoroughly, while Mr. Macgregor's canoe voyage, described in his 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' gives a number of most interesting details. In Ritter's work will also be found some valuable observations on the physical geography of the district, on the geological formation of the basin of the Dead Sea, together with two papers, one by M. Terreil and the other by M. Lartet, on the chemical composition of the Dead Sea waters. <span class="cmt_word">Failed and were cut off.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">were completed, were cut off, i.e.</span>, were completely cut off, so that the supply of water failed, and the channel of the Jordan to the southward, and to the northward as far as Zaretan, became dry ground (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/114-3.htm">Psalm 114:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a></div><div class="verse">And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Firm</span>.

So Drusius: "In medio Jordanis; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra Jordanem. Sic Tyrus legitur sita <span class="accented">in corde maris</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, intra mare nam non procul abest a continente." <span class="cmt_word">Clean over.</span> The word is the same as that translated "failed" in the last note. It means <span class="accented">completion</span> - "till the people had entirely finished crossing." Origen thus explains, in his fourth homily on Joshua, the mystical signification of this crossing the Jordan: "Cure catechumenorum aggregatus es numero, et praeceptis Ecclesiasticis parere coepisti digressus es mare rubrum, et in deserti stationibus positus, ad audiendam Dei legem, et intuendum Mosei vulture per gloriam Domini revelatum quotidie vacas.

Almost every nation has adopted it. The Egyptian obelisks, the stones at Hamath, supposed to be of Hittite origin, the dolmens and other megalithic monuments of the Celts, the Logan or rocking stones, are cases in point. The Scandinavians filled their country with them. Our own Stonehenge and the Avebury stones are supposed by some to be, not temples nor burial places, but memorials of some battle. The command here given to Joshua was regarding what was to be done by the twelve men, who (Joshua 5:4; cf. ch. Joshua 3:12) were already chosen.

The passover, the law itself, as well as certain outward and visible memorials, were to be the guarantees to future ages of the truth of the history related in the Books of Hoses and Joshua. The monument has disappeared, but the observance of the passover and the whole law by the Jews now, more than 3,000 years after the events related in these books, is a perpetual standing witness of the truth of the record. In like manner the Christian passover, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is appealed to by Christians of every denomination as a proof of the substantial truth of the narrative of the Gospels.

Kennicott would read <span class="accented">"from</span> the midst," instead of "<span class="accented">in</span> the midst;" but this purely conjectural emendation is contrary to the fact that these stones were to be set up where the priests bearing the ark stood, while the others were to be set up where the Israelites rested for the night. Again: it has been asked why stones should be placed as a memorial in the Jordan itself, where no man could see them. The answer is a simple one. They were not placed in the Jordan, but at some distance from its banks. They were placed where the priests stood, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, at the <span class="accented">brink</span> of the Jordan ("juxta ripam," Jarchi), which at that time had overflowed its banks (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-15.htm">Joshua 3:15</a>). It is no reply to this to observe with the translator of Keil that the stones would by this interpretation be left high and dry for the greater part of the year, for this would be the very reason why that precise spot was fixed upon for a memorial. Nor does the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5da;</span> in the midst, constitute any valid objection to this interpretation, for the same word is used in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>, although two verses previously we are told that the priests stood at the brink of the swollen river with the soles of their feet just dipped in the water (see note there). Thus while the Vulgate translates "in medio Jordanis alveo," the LXX. renders more accurately by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>. Thus Rosenmuller's objection to the two monuments, namely, that such monuments would never be placed in a rapidly flowing stream like the Jordan, vanishes; while, as Poole suggests, these stones might be heavier, and form even a more enduring memorial than that of the first resting place of the Israelites, constructed as it were of stones which were not beyond the power of one man to carry after all, it may be asked whether it is more probable that this passage is an insertion from another, and an irreconcilable account (Meyer, Knobel), or that it is a later gloss (Rosenmuller, Maurer, etc.), or that two monuments of so mighty and memorable a miracle should have been set up, one at the place where the priests stood, and the other where the Israelites rested after this wonderful interposition of God on their behalf. So Hengstenberg 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 203. The Syriac version only supports Rosenmuller's view. The LXX. and Vulgate render "twelve other stones." The supposition that the sacred historian gives all the commands of God to Joshua, and that therefore such parts of the narrative as are not contained in these commands are to be rejected, is refuted by a comparison, for instance, of <a href="../../par/joshua/3-7.htm">Joshua 3:7, 8</a>, with vers. 13, 17.

Then, when all had safely crossed, the ark of God was borne across the bed of the river, and as soon as the soles of the priests touched the highest point that the waters had reached on the other side, they returned to their place, and all was as it had been before.

See also note on Joshua 3:16). The valley narrows to a gorge at Jericho, through which the Kelt, according to Robinson the ancient Cherith, flows, the source of all the verdure which once bloomed around the city. The gorge of the Kelt Canon Tristram describes as "tremendous," but he believes the Cherith to have been eastward of Jordan, following Mr. Grove, who is here disposed to accept the. tradition of Eusebius and Jerome.

But it was, nevertheless, one important result of it. Joshua was the appointed leader of the Israelites, and he was under God's special protection and guidance. But however much God may overrule our human nature to His own purposes, He never abrogates the laws of its working. Confidence in a leader, from a human point of view, is one of the most essential requisites for success in war. Therefore in the crossing of the Jordan we find Joshua directing all the operations, though the direction of affairs might have been put into other hands, that of Eleazar the high priest, for instance. But this was the public attestation of the secret intimation God had given Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>): "As I was with Moses, so will I be with thee: I will not fail thee nor forsake thee." From this point onward we see no signs of hesitation on the part of the Israelites; nothing but the most unwavering confidence in the Divine mission, as well as in the extraordinary natural gifts, of their leader.

A vivid and picturesque narrative, such as we have before us, could hardly have Been brought together by the liberal use of scissors and paste, with utter disregard of the coherence of the extracts. It is not denied that the writer Of the Book of Joshua may have compiled his history from contemporary documents (see Introduction). All that is affirmed is that in so doing he used his materials with ordinary common sense. As has been before remarked, a marked feature of early Hebrew composition was repetition; repetition with additional details to add to the completeness of the narrative, but designed principally to emphasise the principal facts. Thus we are now told that it was at the command of Joshua, on God's express intimation, that the priests left their post. And to mark more clearly the historian's sense of the importance of the miracle, it is added that, as soon as the priests' feet had left the channel in which the waters had flowed up to the moment that they entered the waters of Jordan on the other side, the waters which had been cut off returned, and flowed exactly where they had done before. This additional fact, supplementing as it does the briefer detail in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a> and <a href="../../par/joshua/4-11.htm">Joshua 4:11</a>, must be therefore regarded as a record of the solemn conviction of the historian that in the events he is narrating he recognised a special interposition of the hand of God (see vers. 23, 24), in which in like manner we find a repetition in fuller detail of the command concerning the stones, designed to mark more clearly the sense the historian wishes his readers to have of the direct interference of God in what he has recorded.

There was just time between the tenth and fourteenth day of the month for the events described in the meantime. And the scrupulous obedience to the law, the provisions of which, we are expressly told, had been of necessity neglected hitherto, is a fact closely in keeping with the character of Joshua, and the whole spirit of the narrative. <span class="cmt_word">Gilgal</span>. The <span class="accented">Gilgal</span>, according to the Masorites, no doubt from its being a circular encampment. Not as yet, however, called by this name (see <a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>). It was "about five miles" (50 stadia, according to Josephus), "from the river banks" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 307). We gather from <a href="../../par/joshua/5-3.htm">Joshua 5:3</a> that it was a rising ground, but it is impossible to identify the spot, since there never existed any town or village there. A spot is shown by the inhabitants about two miles from Jericho, which is held by them in great reverence, but this is further from Jericho than Josephus imagines it to be, for he places it about a mile and a quarter from Jericho. Tristram ('Land of Israel,' p. 216) identifies Riha (see note on Joshua 2:1) with Gilgal, but Bartlett (p. 452) places it "a mile east of Riha," "some three miles or more from the fords." It is hardly probable, however, that the Israelites, in their then unprepared condition (see next chapter, and cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/34-25.htm">Genesis 34:25</a>), encamped so near the city, even though they were conscious of Divine protection, as Josephus would have us suppose. It has been denied by some that the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a> is the same as this one (see notes there, as well as the Masoretic translation above). The reverence for sacred places, such as Gilgal, degenerated in the course of time, according to a well known law of humanity, into superstition - a superstition severely rebuked by the prophets (<a href="../../par/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>). We may compare the idolatrous worship of the brazen serpent (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>). It is sometimes contended by Roman Catholic commentators that no approval of the conduct of Hezekiah is here expressed; but a comparison of this passage with those above cited will show in which direction the minds of inspired men tended. Other places seem to have been similarly regarded with superstitious reverence. Not only do we find Bethel mentioned among such places as we might well expect from Jeroboam's idolatrous worship there, but Beersheba also seems to have become a seat of this misdirected devotion (see <a href="../../par/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>)

Therefore Ewald, Maurer, and Knobel (who says that the second member of the sentence ought to correspond with the first) have altered the pointing in order to bring this passage into conformity with the supposed necessities of grammar. In so doing they have robbed it of its picturesqueness and its meaning. For the object is clearly to show the lasting nature of the fear, "that ye might recognise now the hand of the Lord, that ye might have a thorough and lasting fear of his name." We may here remark on the necessarily miraculous character of the whole narrative of the crossing the Jordan. It admits of no explaining away. The account must either be accepted or rejected <span class="accented">en</span> <span class="accented">bloc.</span> First we have the specific declaration of Rahab in chap. 2:10, that Jehovah dried up the Red Sea, and that this proof of the peculiar protection of Israel by the Most High had struck terror into the hearts of the inhabitants of Canaan. Next we have the fact that Jordan had overflowed its banks. The dangerous nature of the crossing, even at ordinary times, has been mentioned already. Lives are frequently lost in the attempt, as recent travellers with one voice declare. At the time when the waters were out such a crossing was practically impossible to a host like the host of Israel. Nor can there be any mistake about its being the period of the overflowing of Jordan, for the time of the crossing is mentioned. It was the time of harvest - that is, of the barley harvest. This is confirmed by the fact that the recently cut flax was now lying on the roof of Rahab's house, and by the fact that the harley and flax ripened together, a coincidence which we have already mentioned in the note on chap. 2:6. The time is yet further defined. It was the "tenth day of the first month." We learn, moreover, from <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9-15</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6</a> that this was the time when the firstfruits were offered, from which seven weeks were reckoned to the beginning of wheat harvest (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>). Moreover, the passover was kept immediately afterwards (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>), on "the fourteenth day of the first month." Thus the date of the crossing, which is accurately fixed by a variety of circumstances, is clearly proved to correspond with the time of Jordan's overflow. We next come to the measures taken to secure the crossing. There is likewise no mistake here. Not one single intimation is given of an endeavour to break in any way the force of the current, or to preserve the Israelites, either men, women, or children, from the imminent risk they ran of death by drowning. Not only are no other expedients resorted to, but no animals seem to have been prepared to transport them over. Nor, again, were any means used to elude the vigilance of the inhabitants of Canaan. Readers of Xenophon's 'Anabasis ' will not fail to notice how often the passage of the rivers was a matter of the utmost difficulty to that expedition, and how fiercely attempts at crossing were disputed by the half savage tribes of Asia Minor. How are we to account for the fact that no opposition was offered to Joshua's passage by the highly civilised nations of Palestine? According to the narrative before us it was effected in the most leisurely and peaceful manner. What other explanation is possible titan that offered in the text, that when the feet of the priests bearing the ark touched the waters, those waters were cut off by supernatural power, and a way was miraculously made for the people of God through the midst of Jordan? The crossing was remarkable enough, we are told, to have been commemorated by a double memorial (vers. 8, 9). If it had taken place through an unusually easy ford there would have been nothing remarkable about it. Therefore it is clear that the whole narrative of the crossing is either absolute fable or strictly and historically accurate. Let us conclude by summing up the several reasons which make the former alternative inadmissible. The first is the precision with which the date is fixed, and the fact that the correctness of this date is confirmed, as we have seen, by a variety of corroborative evidence. The next is the simplicity and artlessness of the narrative, and its appeal to still existing monuments as confirmatory of the facts recorded. The third is that no account of a battle at Jordan is even hinted at by the Hebrew or any other historian, a battle which must infallibly have taken place had the Israelites attempted to enter Palestine in any ordinary manner; for the supposition that the waters of the ford at Jericho were unusually low at this time is quite inadmissible for the reasons given above; nor can it be supposed that the Israelites crossed the river by any other ford without rejecting the whole history of the conquest. The last reason is the touch of detail given in the word XXX which seems to mark the transition from the soft adhesive mud of the river to the firmness of the dry land beyond (for the word translated "dry land" in chap. 3:17 only means that it was land and not water. Gesenius). Our witness, in fact, can be subjected to the severest cross examination without shaking his testimony. And we are thus compelled to choose between accepting the literal correctness of the narrative as it stands, or crediting the author with a skill in constructing a work of fiction which itself scarcely falls short of the miraculous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../joshua/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Joshua 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Joshua 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../joshua/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Joshua 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Joshua 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/joshua/5.htm"><title>Joshua 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/joshua/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/joshua/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/joshua/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../joshua/4.htm" title="Joshua 4">&#9668;</a> Joshua 5 <a href="../joshua/6.htm" title="Joshua 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/5-1.htm">Joshua 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which <i>were</i> on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which <i>were</i> by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which were on the side of Jordan westward.</span> A large portion of the territory of the Amorites had, as we have seen (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-10.htm">Joshua 3:10</a>), been already conquered. The remaining tribes on the other side Jordan were apprehensive of the same fate. For "on the side," the original has "across." Having hitherto written of Israel as on the eastern side of Jordan, he continues the same expression after he has narrated the crossing. But writing as he did on the west side of Jordan, and for readers the vast majority of whom were on the west side of Jordan, he adds the expression "westward" (literally, <span class="accented">seaward</span>) to prevent any possibility of mistake. <span class="cmt_word">Until we were passed over.</span> The Masorites, in the <span class="accented">Keri</span>, have corrected the text (<span class="accented">Chethibh</span>) into "until <span class="accented">they</span> were passed over." Kennicott states that this reading is confirmed by twenty-seven Hebrew MSS., which have probably adopted the reading from the Masoretic correction. The LXX. accepts the <span class="accented">Chethibh.</span> The probability, however, is that this is one of the many instances of a conjectural emendation of a difficult passage, it not having been seen that the historian was either quoting a document contemporary with the events described, or more probably using the word to identify himself as an Israelite with the acts of his fathers in past times. This is the opinion of Rabbi David Kimchi. Knobel refers to <a href="../../par/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>. See also ver. 6 of this chapter, and <a href="../../par/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5, 6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17</a>; cf. 19. We must not, then, assume from this passage that the Book of Joshua was written by one who himself had a share in the events recorded, in the face of many indications we have of a later origin (see <a href="../../par/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>, etc.). A fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the introduction. <span class="cmt_word">Their heart melted.</span> Confirming what Rahab had said (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-11.htm">Joshua 2:11</a>). Similar terror has often been struck into the hearts of peoples, especially of peoples enervated by habits of licentious indulgence, by the approach of enemies who have successfully and rapidly overcome obstacles deemed insurmountable. Such an effect was produced in Persia by Alexander's victories at the Granicus and Issus. Such an effect, again, was produced in Italy by the tidings of the approach of Alaric and Attila. If we may trust the monk of St. Gall, a similar terror fell on the degenerate Lombards at the approach of Charles the Great, after his daring passage of the Alps. In this case the miraculous element was added, and the inhabitants of Canaan, and of Jericho especially, remained for the time panic stricken, not daring to combine to strike a blow against these daring invaders, who in addition to their bravery seemed under the special protection of Heaven. When they had recovered from the consternation into which the passage of the Jordan had thrown them, the sense of an imminent danger forced them at last to make an effort at resistance (see ch. 10.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/5-2.htm">Joshua 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time.</span> Ver. I is introduced in order to explain why Joshua ventured upon the circumcision of the children of Israel at so critical a period. Nothing could more clearly evince the spirit of confidence in Jehovah which animated not only Joshua, but all the children of Israel. We read of no murmurings, although it was well known that the performance of the rite of circumcision would unfit the Israelites for active service for some days. We may imagine, and even the silence of the sacred historian may be deemed eloquent on the point, that the marvellous passage of the Jordan had inspired the Israelites with an eager desire to renew their covenant with the God who "had done so great things for them already." And although, for religious reasons, they remained inactive for four or five days, a course of action from a military point of view highly injudicious, yet such was the terror the passage of the Jordan had struck into the hearts of the Phoenicians that no attack on them was attempted, and the inhabitants of Jericho (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>) remained under the protection of their strong walls. <span class="cmt_word">Sharp knives,</span> or <span class="accented">knives of stone</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>; cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/4-25.htm">Exodus 4:25</a>). The LXX., Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic versions, as well as the margins of our Bibles, render thus. On the other hand, several of the Rabbis give the same translation as the text of our version. The LXX. translator, following no doubt an ancient tradition, adds after <a href="../../par/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>, that these knives were buried with Joshua (see note there). The idea which has found great favour lately of a "stone age," as anterior to an "iron age," of the world, will hardly derive support from this passage. That the use of stone preceded the use of iron scarcely admits of a doubt. But from <a href="../../par/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a> we learn that the use of iron had been known hundreds of years before Joshua, and yet we find him using stone knives. And we may go further. In spite of the advance of civilisation in our own day, there are still millions of human beings who have not advanced beyond the "stone age." The idea, then, of an age in which the universal use of iron has supplanted the universal use of stone is an idea which facts compel us to reject, while admitting that the use of stone must have preceded the use of iron in the infancy of the human race. In these "knives of flint," Origen, Theodoret, and others see an allusion to Christ, the rock. The second time. For "circumcise again the children of Israel the second time," the literal translation is, "return (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>) to circumcise," or, "return, circumcise" them the second time. This has perplexed the commentators and translators. It has been assumed that the text involves the idea of a former general circumcision of the people, and various are the expedients which have been resorted to in order to avoid the difficulty. Some copies of the LXX. would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span> (or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span> Rosenmuller), and translate "sit down" <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, halt), "and circumcise" The Vulgate leaves out the word altogether. The Syriac translates literally. The Arabic reads "tomorrow" for "again." The Rabbi Solomon Jarchi falls back on the expedient of a general circumcision ordered by Moses on the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt, on account of their neglect of that rite while they sojourned there, "Nam jam antea magna multitudo simul erat circumcisa illa nocte qua egrediebantur ex AEgypto." But this is rendered highly improbable by the fact that circumcision was an Egyptian as well as a Hebrew custom, and still more so by the improbability that such an important circumstance should have been passed over in silence. Knobel regards Abraham's circumcision with that of his household as the first time (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>). Perhaps the best explanation is that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;</span>, though it is rightly translated "again" here, and in several other places in Scripture, carries with it the idea of a <span class="accented">return into a former condition</span> (<span class="accented">kehre zuruck</span>, Knobel). So <a href="../../par/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30-31.htm">Genesis 30:31</a>, Hosea 2:11 (Hosea 2:9, in our version). In <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a> we have the king's <span class="accented">return to his former purpose</span> in the second and third mission to Elijah. Thus here the word is used of the <span class="accented">bringing back</span> the children of Israel to their former state, that of a people who were in the enjoyment of a visible sign and seal (<a href="../../par/romans/4-11.htm">Romans 4:11</a>) of their being God's covenant people. The meaning therefore would seem to be, "Restore the children of Israel a second time to the position they formerly held, as visibly bound to me, and placed under my protection, by the rite of circumcision." "The person must be in favour ere the work can hope to prosper; his predecessor Moses had like to have been slain for neglect of this sacrament, when he went to call the people out of Egypt; he justly fears his own safety, if now he omit it, when they are brought into Canaan" (Bp. Hall).

For, before the exodus, Moses was not in a position to perform any general act of this kind, as the history plainly shows, while after it such a rite could not have taken place, since the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> denotes a state of things which was completed at the time spoken of, and therefore must here be rendered (as above) by the pluperfect. <span class="cmt_word">Them they had not circumcised.</span> Here again the Hebrew is used of the perfected action, and is therefore rightly rendered by our version, giving the idea that the Israelites who were born in the wilderness had not been circumcised up to the point which our history has now reached.

It is applied to the Israelites in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-2.htm">Isaiah 26:2</a>. See also <a href="../../par/exodus/33-13.htm">Exodus 33:13</a>. In the singular it means a people in the more general sense, a nation, as distinguished from a people in whom one has an interest. In the plural it always means the Gentiles. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>. (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), the word usually applied to the people of God, is not used here, because the people who "provoked God in the wilderness" had made themselves in a sense a rejected people. Delitzsch regards this (after Calvin) as a sign that, for the time at least, the covenant between God and Israel was annulled, permanently in the case of those who were condemned to die in the wilderness, temporarily only in their descendants, who were formally reconciled to God, and restored to their former covenant position by this solemn performance of the covenant rite of circumcision (see note on verse 2). So also Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 205. The difficulty about the passover may be met by supposing that those only who were circumcised - a constantly decreasing number, of course - were allowed to celebrate that feast. Knobel would understand that in consequence of the "unquiet, unsettled, uncomfortable life" the Israelites led in the wilderness, they could keep very few of the ordained feasts. He continues: "the Elohist knows nothing of any cessation." Nevertheless we read of no passover being <span class="accented">kept</span> after the one recorded in <a href="../../par/numbers/9-5.htm">Numbers 9:5</a>, so that if "the Elohist knows of no cessation," he knows as little of any continued observance of the feast. But there is no certainty on the point. Considering the loose way in which the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> is used in Scripture (see, for instance, <a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), we need not press the word to include <span class="accented">all</span> who were born after the departure from Egypt, but only those who were born after the rejection of the people recorded in <a href="../../par/numbers/14-26.htm">Numbers 14:26</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> This rejection, be it remembered, did not include all the Israelites who were born in Egypt, but only those who were over twenty years of age (<a href="../../par/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>). The view of Kurz (3:323, Clark's translation), that circumcision was suspended on account of the continual movements of the Israelites, is refuted by Delitzsch's remark that the Israelites were not continually on the march, but that they often encamped in one place for a long period, a period far longer, in fact, than the time in which they abode in Gilgal. Delitzsch asks why this circumcision did not take place before, why it was not performed as soon as they crossed the brook Zered. The answer is that, until the Jordan was crossed, they had not taken formal possession of their own land. As soon as, under the Divine protection, they had crossed the Jordan, the long-delayed promise was fulfilled. God's covenant with Abraham was accomplished, and now they, in their turn, had to place themselves once more in the position of God's covenant people, bound to serve Him with their whole heart. For a fuller discussion of this question see Keil's Commentary, and Hengstenberg in the passage cited above. We may observe that God fulfils His part of the covenant first, and then it is man's duty to fulfil his. God, under the Christian dispensation, first places us in the state of salvation. Then it becomes our duty to make that salvation sure by overcoming God's enemies, by the help which He never fails to afford. Give us. This introduction of the first person into the middle of the sentence is unexpected. Some MSS. and editors read "to them" (see note on ver. 1, and <a href="../../par/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>, where there is a similar change of person). <span class="cmt_word">A land that floweth with milk and honey.</span> This, says Keil, "is a standing expression in the Pentateuch to express the great fertility of the land of Canaan. Milk and honey are produced by a land rich in grass and flowers, which were both of them plentiful in Canaan (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15, 22</a>). Milk, not only of cows, but of sheep and goats also (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>), and eaten sometimes sweet, at other times thick or curdled (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span>), was a leading article of food amongst the ancient Hebrews, as it is in the present day in most Eastern countries, and Palestine was peculiarly fitted for the rearing of cattle. Honey also, especially that of wild bees, was found in large quantities (<a href="../../par/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8</a>, sqq.; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-26.htm">1 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and is still found, notwithstanding its present desolate condition." Some have thought <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to mean the newly expressed juice of grapes, which, under the Arabic name of <span class="accented">dibs</span>, is largely used at present in Palestine, and is even exported to other countries. But in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>, <a href="../../par/psalms/81-16.htm">Psalm 81:16</a>, wild honey is clearly meant, which is to this day deposited by bees, in the clefts of the rock, whence it often overflows and is received into vessels placed beneath (see <a href="../../par/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3</a>; <a href="../../par/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>; Jahn, 'Biblical Archaeology;' and Smith's Dictionary of the Bible.)

Objections have been raised (see Keil and Delitzsch <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) to the possibility of this circumcision taking place in one day. But it has been shown by calculation that between one-third and one-fourth of the people who remained had been circumcised already, and that therefore such an operation as this could be performed with the utmost ease in a very short time. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;</span> is used here again, since the people were still Gentiles until the rite of circumcision was performed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you.

If we accept <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> we must refer the phrase to the reproach cast upon the Israelites by the Egyptians, that all their vain glorious boasts were worthless, and that they were never destined to occupy the land which they declared God had given to them. Hengstenberg ('Geschichte des Retches Gottes,' p. 207) regards it strangely as the reproach the Egyptians cast upon them that they were rejected of God. If <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it must be regarded as equivalent to the reproach that they were a nation of slaves, a reproach that was rolled away by the fact of their standing as freemen on the soil which had been promised to their fathers. But Knobel supposes <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that it was their down-trodden miserable condition in Egypt, a condition which was only partially ameliorated during their wanderings in the wilderness, in the course of which, accustomed to a settled existence, they must have had much to endure. "With the arrival in Canaan," he adds, "all this came to an end. All those who had deserved punishment were dead, all the uncircumcised were circumcised, reproach and misery were put aside, and Israel, as the worthy community of God, entered on a new life." This interpretation, more precise and clear than (2), best satisfies all the requirements of the passage. Some have regarded their uncircumcised state as the "reproach of Egypt." But this, as Hengstenberg remarks, could hardly be, for none but the Egyptian priests were circumcised. Origen (Horn. 4, 'Lib. Jesu Nave') teaches the following lesson from this passage: "Fuimus enim nos aliquando insipientes, increduli, errantes, servientes desideriis et voluptatibus varlis, in malitiam, et invidia, odibiles, odientes invicem. Non tibi videntur haec opprobia esse, et opprobia AEgypti? Sed ex quo venit Christus, et dedit nobis secundam circumcisionem per baptismum regenerationis, et purgavit animas nostras, abjecimus haec omnia." And again, speaking of the spiritual circumcision Christians have received, and the obligation to purity thus imposed, he adds, "Jam tibi enim non licet templo Dei uti, nisi in sanctitate, nec membra Christi ad iudignum dare negotium ... Si quando te malae concupiscentiae pulsat illecebra...  dic non sum meus, enitus enim sum pretio sanguinis Christi, et membrum ipsius effectus sum." Theodoret remarks how the Israelites who had been circumcised perished in the wilderness, while their uncircumcised children were miraculously preserved and brought over Jordan. A remarkable commentary this on the words, "Now circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law; but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision" (<a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>. Cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/7-19.htm">1 Corinthians 7:19</a>). He also remarks that "we may here learn how we, who have received spiritual circumcision, thereby laid aside the reproach of sin." Trusting by nature in the spiritual Egypt, the house of bondage, we are slaves to sin and corruption. When we enter into fellowship with Christ, the reproach of Egypt is rolled away, and we enjoy "the glorious liberty of the children of God" (see <a href="../../par/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18-22</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>; also <a href="../../par/john/8-32.htm">John 8:32-36</a>). Gilgal. It is quite possible, since the word to roll is in Hebrew, as indeed in English, spoken of a circular motion and since <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> is a wheel in Hebrew, that the place, like Geliloth, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, circles (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a>), originally meant a circle, and that the new signification was attached to the name from this moment. If <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> be not a later insertion, the place was known by the name before this time.

Many MSS. which are followed by the LXX. and Syriac versions, have <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span> here. The Chaldee and Vulgate read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span>, and the Masorites do not reckon this among the 15 passages in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> is read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;</span> (Keil). But when Keil adds that a comparison of this passage with <a href="../../par/joshua/24-21.htm">Joshua 24:21</a> decides the point, he is going too far, since <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> often stands, like the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, before a quotation, in the place of our inverted commas (see, for instance, <a href="../../par/genesis/29-33.htm">Genesis 29:33</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>, etc.). The various reading has no doubt arisen from the ambiguity of the passage, for it appears grammatically doubtful to which part of Joshua's question the particle of negation applies. Yet it is obvious enough practically that it is in answer to the last portion of it. <span class="cmt_word">But as captain of the Lord's host am I now come.</span> Literally, <span class="accented">"for</span> (or <span class="accented">but</span>) <span class="accented">I, the captain of the Lord's host, have now come."</span> As though he would say, "the struggle is now imminent; the conflict is all but begun; and now, at the critical moment when my help is needed, I, the captain of the hosts of the Lord, the leader of all that vast army of unseen confederates, who are destined to marshal the forces of nature, the elements of supernatural terror and dismay, on the side of the Israelites, am come to help you." That the Lord's host must mean the angels is clear from such passages as <a href="../../par/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/148-2.htm">Psalm 148:2</a>; St. <a href="../../par/luke/2-13.htm">Luke 2:13</a> (aft <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Hengstenberg, in his 'Christology,' illustrates by <a href="../../par/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>. Two opinions have been held by the early Church concerning this manifestation. The first regards it as the appearance of the Son of God in a visible form; the second supposes it to have been a created being - an angel - through whom Jehovah was pleased to manifest Himself. The former opinion was general in the earliest ages of the Church. The appearance of the Arian heresy, however, brought this interpretation into discredit. It was felt to be dangerous to admit it, lest it should lead to the notion that the Logos, however great and glorious a being he might be, however superior to all other created beings, was nevertheless removed by an infinite interval from the Supreme God Himself. The Jewish interpreters differ on the point. Maimonides and others (see next note) do not regard the appearance as a real one. The majority seem <span class="accented">to</span> have supposed it to have been the Archangel Michael. We will proceed to examine the scriptural and patristic evidence on the subject. That appearances, believed to be manifestations of God Himself in a visible form, are recorded in Scripture, is a fact which cannot be denied. Thus we have the voice of God (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) walking in the garden (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-8.htm">Genesis 3:8</a>). Again, in ch. 15, though first God appears to Abraham in a vision, the nature of the manifestation would seem to have changed in some respects afterwards, for we read" he brought him forth abroad" (ver. 5). Again, in ch. 18, we find that Jehovah "appeared" to Abraham as he dwelt by the oaks of Mature (ver. 1), and the narrative would suggest that Jehovah Himself appeared, and two attendant angels. This is further corroborated by the fact that Abraham remains in conference with Jehovah, while the two angels who arrived in the evening at Sodom do not appear to have been spoken of as Jehovah, or to have received Divine honours from Lot. The "man" who (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24</a>) wrestled with Jacob is described afterwards (ver. 30) as "God." The "angel of the Lord" who (<a href="../../par/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) "appeared" unto Moses "in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush," is immediately afterwards described as Jehovah and Elohim (ver. 4), and, as in the present passage, Moses is instructed to remove his shoe from his foot in consequence of the holiness of the place in which so great a Being appeared. And here we are led to investigate the nature of that mysterious being who is described as "the angel of the Lord," the "angel," or, as the word is sometimes translated, "messenger of the covenant." He appears to Hagar (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>), and she immediately proceeds (ver. 13) to express her belief that it is God whom she has seen. The angel who appears to Abraham at the sacrifice of Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11, 12, 18</a>) speaks of Himself as God. The voice of the angel, again, is regarded by Leah and Rachel as the voice of God (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-11.htm">Genesis 31:11, 16</a>), and He calls Himself so (ver. 13). Jacob speaks of the angel as having "redeemed him from all evil" (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-16.htm">Genesis 48:16</a>), but here the term Goel, though it means a ransomer, is not necessarily connected with <span class="accented">moral</span> evil. After His appearance to Hoses in the bush He becomes the special guide of the children of Israel. His divinity is again asserted in <a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>, for the Being there spoken of as Jehovah is described in Joshua 14:19 as His angel. The solemn terms in which the God of Israel refers to him in <a href="../../par/exodus/23-20.htm">Exodus 23:20, 21</a> must not be passed over. He is the "Angel of Jehovah." He is sent to "keep" Israel "in the way." They were to take heed and not rebel against Him (so LXX.); for, adds Jehovah, "My name is in His inward parts" (not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> denoting close and intimate union). Cf. ver. 93 and <a href="../../par/exodus/32-34.htm">Exodus 32:34</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-2.htm">Exodus 33:2</a>. This angel is called the Face, or <span class="accented">Faces</span>, of the Lord (<a href="../../par/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>), and is thus specially identified with the revelation of Him, like the term <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> in the New Testament. The angel that withstood Balaam assumes a tone of authority in harmony with this view (<a href="../../par/numbers/22-22.htm">Numbers 22:22-35</a>). Whether the angel at Bochim (<a href="../../par/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1</a>) were a Divine or human messenger does not appear from the narrative, and the word is occasionally, as in <a href="../../par/haggai/1-13.htm">Haggai 1:13</a>, used of a prophet. But the appearance to Gideon and Manoah has a Divine character (<a href="../../par/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-22</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/13-8.htm">Judges 13:8-22</a>). And the special reference to Jehovah, the angel of the covenant, in <a href="../../par/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> seems to point in a special manner to the Second Person in the Blessed Trinity. This view, as has been stated, is the view of the earlier Fathers, nor does there seem any reasonable ground for its rejection by those of later date. The idea that the Logos, always the medium of the Father's revelation and impartation of Himself, in creation as in redemption, frequently took a visible form under the old dispensation in order to communicate the Divine will to mankind, does not in the least militate against the doctrine of His consubstantiality with the Father. On the contrary, it rather emphasises the fact which the New Testament teaches us throughout, that the Logos was ever the manifestation, the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/john/1.htm">John 1</a>.) of the Father, the eternal medium whereby He communicates Himself beyond Himself. This was in the main the view of the earliest Fathers. They might use an incautious expression now and then, but they ever intended to be true to the doctrine of the Consubstantial Son of the Father, who took a visible shape to convey the Father's mind to man. Thus Justin Martyr ('Dial. cum Tryphone,' 56) cites <a href="../../par/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1, 2</a> to prove that, as he says, "there is another God under (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) the the Creator of all things, who is called an angel because he announces (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) whatever the Creator of all things desires him to announce." This being, he adds, "was also God before the creation of the world." He was another God than the Creator of the world in number (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>), not in mind (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x1fc3;</span>). And from the expression "the Lord rained down fire and brimstone from the Lord out of heaven" (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>), he deduces the belief that this Being was "Lord from beside (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>) the Lord who is in heaven." He proceeds to cite the passages from the Old Testament which have just been mentioned, and to draw from them the conclusion which has just been drawn, that this Being was one who ministered (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) to God who is above; the word, the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> whom He begat before all creation (see. 60, 61). Similarly Theophilus ('Ad Autolycum, 2:22) says that the Word of God held a colloquy with Adam in the person (or representation, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>) of God. Irenaeus ('Adv. Haer.,' 4:7, 4) speaks of the Being who spake to Abraham at Mamre and Moses in the bush as superior to all created angels, and as, in fact, the Word of God; though afterwards (Joshua 20:11) he modifies this statement into a manifestation of "claritatem et dispositiones patris," "secundum dispositionum ejus causas sive efficaciam." It is to be remembered that we unfortunately chiefly possess Irenaeus in a very unsatisfactory Latin dress. Similar passages may be found in Clem., 'Alex. Paed.,' 1:7; and Tertullian, 'Adv. Prax.,' 14. The latter says that God was "invisible as the Father, but visible as the Son," the latter being the means whereby the former was revealed. The passage from Clement is embodied and improved upon in a passage in the 'Apostolic Constitutions,' which presents the primitive doctrine on this point in clearer language than any other. "To Him (Christ) did Moses bear witness, and said, 'The Lord received fire from the Lord, and rained it down.' Him did Jacob see as a man, and said, 'I have seen God face to face, and my soul is preserved.' Him did Abraham entertain, and acknowledge to be the Judge and his Lord. Him did Moses see in the bush. Him did Joshua the son of Nun see, as captain of the Lord's host, for assistance against Jericho" ('Apost. Const.,' 5:20). One passage more will be cited on this point. "Who else," says Origen, in his Homily on this passage, "is the prince of the host of the virtues of the Lord, save our Lord Jesus Christ? .... Joshua would not have adored," he adds, "unless he had recognised God." The fact that the later Fathers (St. Augustine, for instance, and Theodoret, who holds that it was Michael the Archangel who appeared to Joshua) rejected this interpretation would not be sufficient to outweigh primitive testimony at once so explicit and so general, unless it were supported by the strongest arguments. The fact that it was rejected rather from prudential motives, and that such prudence was, in point of fact, entirely unnecessary, robs the later interpretation of much of its weight. Thus much at least is certain, that we may adopt the earlier one without fear of prejudicing thereby the doctrine of the divinity of Christ. Further information on this point will be found in Hengstenberg's 'Christology,' in Liddon's 'Bampton Lectures' (Lect. it.), in Bull ('Defens. Fid. Nicen.,' 1:1), and in Keil's Commentaries upon the various passages of the Old Testament, cited above. "He here appeared as a soldier, with His sword drawn in His hand. To Abraham in his tent He appeared as a traveller; to Joshua in the field, as a man of war. Christ will be to His people what their faith expects and desires" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua fell on his face.</span> The apparition had no doubt taken Joshua by surprise. He believed himself to be alone, when suddenly he found himself confronted by a warrior, with his sword drawn. Uncertain, in those days when Divine interposition was more common than it is now, whether what he saw was a proof that he was watched by enemies, who had resolved to cut him off by surprise, or whether God had vouchsafed to appear to him, but evidently quite prepared to expect the latter, he addresses a question to the apparition, which of itself implies at least a half belief that what he saw was something above nature. He needs but the simple reply just recorded to lead him to prostrate himself in simple faith before the Mighty One who now stood before him to be the defence and shield of His people from all their adversaries. Maimonides, in his 'Moreh Nevochim,' and others (as, for instance, Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 209) have regarded this as a vision seen by Joshua when he was alone, plunged in deep meditation on the difficult task before him. But without denying that many of the. Divine interpositions recorded in Scripture (as, for instance, that in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) took place through the inner workings of the mind as the medium of their action, yet here, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32</a>, and most probably in <a href="../../par/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, we have visible appearances of God to men in deep anxiety of heart, pondering "great matters" which were "too high for them." Whether we choose to accept or reject the historical narrative as a whole, there can be no rational ground for doubting that the Hebrew historians wrote under the full persuasion that they and their forefathers lived under a dispensation of continual Divine interpositions, sometimes taking place by secret inward intimations, sometimes through the Urim and Thummim; sometimes, at a crisis in the history of the nation or of an individual, by actual external appearances of God in a visible form, and that we have here an account of one of these. The purport of the appearance is, however, obscured by our present division of chapters. The narrative proceeds without a break as far as <a href="../../par/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>. <a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a> is simply parenthetical and explanatory. Thus we gather that Joshua was meditating the plan of his future campaign, and deliberating on the best mode of capturing the strong walled city close by which (ver. 13) he stood, when God appeared to him in the form of a warrior, and solved all his doubts by commanding him to prepare for a miraculous intervention of His Providence, and in the place of warlike expedients to resort to a religious ceremony, which should be the external token to all the surrounding nations that the invading host was under the protection of the Lord of heaven and earth; a fact of which they were more than half convinced by the supernatural passage of the Red Sea and the Jordan (see <a href="../../par/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-1.htm">Joshua 6:1</a>).

It explains why the captain of the Lord's host appeared unto Joshua. The inhabitants of Jericho, though in a state of the utmost alarm, were nevertheless fully on their guard against the children of Israel. The commencement of hostilities imposed a great responsibility on Joshua. Success at the outset was, humanly speaking, indispensable. We may see what defeat involved for him by his distress in consequence of the check at Ai. The alternative was victory or annihilation, for the Israelites had no homes or fortresses to which they could retire. Joshua was therefore encouraged by a visible proof that he was under the protection of the Most High, to be yet farther assured by the marvels that were to follow. The use of the Pual participle with its fullest intensive sense, to strengthen the affirmation of the action by the Kal, is a singular construction. Literally rendered it is "shutting and closely shut up," thus including <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the act of closing, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the continuance of that act, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span> (LXX.), "clausa at que munita" (Vulg.). So also the Chaldea paraphrase. The remainder of the verse strengthens still more the assertion of the state of siege. The king of Jericho, such was his alarm, regarded his city as a beleaguered one, from the mere presence of Joshua and his host in its vicinity.

The LXX., which Calvin and our translators and the majority of commentators follow, regard this part of the sentence as stating what was to be done on the six days, and rightly so, as vers. 8-14 clearly show. That the historian, as has been before remarked, did not always give the full instructions Joshua received is evident from this passage. The priests are not said to have been instructed to sound the trumpet on the six days; yet we learn from Joshua 5:13 that they did so. It is rather implied than expressed that the ark was also to be borne in procession; but that this was (lone is evident from ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Seven trumpets of rams' horns.</span> There is no mention of rams' horns in the original, which is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> trumpets of jubilee, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of  triumph (hardly as Gesenius, "alarm trumpets," though not necessarily, with Dr. Vaughan in his 'Heroes of Faith,' "the emblems of festival, not of warfare"). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is derived from the same root as the Latin is in the phrase Io Triumphe (cf. Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;</span>), and according to Gesenius our word "yule" is also derived from this root. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> as the next verse shows, was a curved instrument, in shape like a ram's horn, though not necessarily of that material; whereas the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e6;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> was a straight trumpet. <span class="cmt_word">Seven times.</span> The importance of the number seven as indicative of completeness is here strongly indicated. Seven priests were to carry seven trumpets for seven days. The word for to swear, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> literally to be <span class="accented">sevened</span>, means to have one's vow consecrated and confirmed by seven sacrifices or seven witnesses (see <a href="../../par/genesis/21-28.htm">Genesis 21:28, 30</a>). The number seven, says Bahr in his 'Symbolik des Alten Testament,' 1, 187, 188, is the sign of the relation, union, communion between God and the world, as represented by the number three and four respectively, just as twelve is in another relation (see note on Joshua 21:3). Its meaning, according to Bahr, among the heathen is somewhat different. There it means the harmony of the universe, and is signified by the seven stars, to which, and neither more nor less, was the power of influencing man's destiny ascribed. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</span> "Fac tibi tribas ductiles, si sacerdos es, immo, quia sacerdos es (gens enim regalis effectus es et sacerdotium sanctum, de te enim scripture est), fac tibi tribas ductiles ex Scripturis sanctis" (Orig., Hom. 7 on Joshua).

So Rosenmuller. The word. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> in Hebrew is used in different senses, all, however, growing out of the one original sense.

Kimchi and Jarchi refer this to the Reubenites and their brethren, but without sufficient authority. Keil thinks that it was impossible that the unarmed people would have gone with the procession as "the rereward" (see note on Joshua 5:13), because no command to that effect is given in ver. 3. But as he has told us in <a href="../../par/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3, 4</a>, and as we have just seen in ver. 4. the command to Joshua is <span class="accented">not</span> fully given.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-9.htm">Joshua 6:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, <i>the priests</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</div><div class="comm">

The people of Jericho knew only too well what this religious procession meant. As a military manoeuvre (so Calvin) it was worse than useless, it was ridiculous. It actually invited attack; nay, it afforded, if the interpretation in the note on ver. 8 be correct, an admirable opportunity for the slaughter of defenceless women and children by a sudden sally from the city. But the history of the Exodus was not unknown to the king and people of Jericho. The inspired law giver, with his miraculous powers, and his claim to direct intercourse with the Most High, was a personage only too well known to them, and his mission was only too sure a token of the Divine sanction which rested on their proceedings. His supernatural qualifications had evidently descended to his successor, and now it was terribly clear that this awful silent march, with the army equipped for battle, but not attempting to engage in it, the seven priests with their seven trumpets, the visible symbol of the Presence of the God of Israel, attended by the awestruck multitude awaiting the Divine pleasure, was but the prelude to some new interposition from on high, the mysterious foreshadowing of some hitherto unheard of calamity which should befall the devoted city. There seems in this narrative no choice between rejecting the whole as an absurd fable, or accepting it as the record of a "notable miracle." The account is minute in its detail. The historian, if he be an historian, is distinctly impressed with the idea that he is relating a miracle. The obvious course for Joshua, if he were not relying on supernatural aid, was either to assault or to blockade the city. To perambulate it for days in the expectation of some convulsion of nature such as, we are told, frequently happened in that volcanic region, would have been the extreme of childish folly, and quite contrary to that common sense and military skill with which, as we have seen, Joshua undoubtedly was endowed. If he were possessed, seven days beforehand, with a conviction that an earthquake were imminent, such a persuasion would be of itself miraculous. <span class="accented">Paulus'</span> idea of a mine having been sprung is still less compatible with our narrative. Von Lengerke, in his 'Cana supposes that the astonishing success of the Israelites grew into a wonder in the hands of the narrator. But this involves the entire falsehood, not only of the command given to Joshua by Jehovah, but of the seven days' perambulation of Jericho, and the remaining incidents of the siege, a theory not easily reconcilable with the minute accuracy of detail displayed throughout the narrative. The seven days' circuit of Jericho must, therefore, either be denied altogether, in spite of the numerous evidences of genuineness which meet us in the narrative; or, if explained, the only explanation which is consistent with the fact is, that Joshua had received an intimation that he was not to expect to effect the reduction of the city by natural means, but was to wait patiently for an interposition from on high.

The sin of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.) was the sparing of anything whatever in the city which had been laid under the ban - a ban which Saul had been specially commanded to execute (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>) according to the principles laid down in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>. When Keil, however, states that the ban "could never be pronounced upon things and property alone, but only upon open idolaters, either with or without their possessions," he appears to have overlooked <a href="../../par/leviticus/27-16.htm">Leviticus 27:16-21</a>, where a man may devote irredeemably to God property of <span class="accented">his own</span> (cf. ver. 28 of the same chapter). In his subsequent work, however, Keil qualifies this assertion by a consideration of this very passage. Idolatrous worship was the one thing which justified the Israelites in laying one of their own cities under the ban (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12</a> 18, above cited). But (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>) it had been pronounced against the Canaanites. Property, how. ever, save in the case of Jericho, seems to have been exempted from the ban (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a>). Even at Jericho the silver and the gold, the brass and the iron, were placed in the treasury of the Lord (Joshua 5:19, 24). "Why," says Theodoret, "was the city thus devoted? It was devoted on the same principle which offered the first fruits to God, since it was the first fruits of their conquests." Because she hid.

For a fuller discussion of the bearing of this passage on the date of the Book of Joshua, see Introduction. There is no mention of Rahab's marriage in the Old Testament. Lightfoot ('Hebrew and Talmudicai Exercitations?' <a href="../../par/matthew/1-5.htm">Matthew 1:5</a>) mentions a tradition that she married <span class="accented">Joshua!</span> Dr. W. H. Mill, in his treatise on the genealogies of our Lord, defends the tradition St. Matthew has followed by showing that Salmon's age at the time gives immense probability to the statement. Some (see the Bishop of Bath and Wells' article in Smith's ' Dictionary of the Bible') suppose that Salmon was one of the spies. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a></div><div class="verse">And Joshua adjured <i>them</i> at that time, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest <i>son</i> shall he set up the gates of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joshua adjured them</span>. Caused them to swear, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, bound them by an oath, as the Hiphil implies here. This was the strict meaning of "adjure" at the time our version was made (cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>). But it had also the less definite meaning which it now has, of solemnly warning a person to do something or to leave it undone (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-16.htm">1 Kings 22:16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>). The object of this solemn adjuration (see above) was to preserve Jericho as a spot devoted to God for ever; and for this reason a curse was pronounced upon any one who should attempt to found a city upon the devoted spot (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-16.htm">Deuteronomy 13:16</a>, "It shall not be rebuilt.") This curse actually fell on the reckless Hiel (<a href="../../par/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>; cf. Josephus, 'Antiq.,' V. 1:8), and he saw the laying of its foundations marked by the death of his eldest son, while the death of his youngest followed its completion. It does not seem that it was forbidden to build habitations on the spot, far Jericho is frequently <span class="accented">mentioned</span> in the New Testament, and the house of Zacchaeus (<a href="../../par/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5</a>) was there. What seems to have been forbidden was the erection of a fortified city there (see Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 214). The mention of Jericho in ch. 18:21 does not imply that it was an inhabited city, but simply that the site of Jericho fell within the border of the tribe of Benjamin. For Jerusalem is also mentioned, and we know that it did not become theirs until the time of David. Whether the "city of palm trees" (<a href="../../par/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>) is Jericho, may be questioned. But in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-5.htm">2 Samuel 10:5</a> and in <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-5.htm">2 Kings 2:5</a> express mention is made of Jericho, the last time as the site of the school of the prophets. Some commentators have endeavoured to restrict the sense of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> used here to the building of fortifications. But this is unduly to restrict its meaning, for it is constantly used also of houses and altars (see <a href="../../par/genesis/2-22.htm">Genesis 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a>). But the mention of gates clearly implies a fortified city. Commentators cite as parallel instances the curse of Agamemnon on Troy, of Croesus on Sidene (so Grotius from Strabo, lib. 13 de Ilio), and of Scipio upon Carthage, and it is observed that when Augustus rebuilt Carthage he carefully avoided the old site. <span class="cmt_word">In his first born.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> is often used of the price paid for a thing, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/29-18.htm">Genesis 29:18</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/7-23.htm">Isaiah 7:23</a>. And in his youngest son. The commentators have remarked on the rhythmical parallelism here, and Keil and others have supposed the passage to be an extract from an old Hebrew songbook, such as that of Jasher (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>). But this parallelism is not only a characteristic of poetry, but of all solemn and impassioned utterances in the language. (See, for instance, <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/17-14.htm">1 Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). Masius, Munsterus, and others interpret the passage that the eldest son died when the foundation was laid; all the rest, but the youngest, in the interim; the youngest when the gates were set up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

But the LXX. is here rather a paraphrase than a translation). It is clearly used here of some <span class="accented">secret</span> act. But in <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-15.htm">Leviticus 5:15</a> it is used of an <span class="accented">unwitting</span> trespass, committed <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, in error of fact, but not of intention. <span class="cmt_word">Achan</span>.

Zimri</span> in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a>. Such variations of reading are extremely common, and are increased in our version by the varieties of English spelling adopted among our translators (see Shemuel for Samuel in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>). The LXX. has <span class="accented">Zambri</span> here. <span class="cmt_word">Took of the accursed thing.</span> Commentators have largely discussed the question how the sin of Achan could be held to extend to the whole people. But it seems sufficient to reply by pointing out the organic unity of the Israelitish nation. They were then, as Christians are now, the Church of the living God. And if one single member of the community violated the laws which God imposed on them, the whole body was liable for his sin, until it had purged itself by a public act of restitution (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">Deuteronomy 21:1-8</a>). So St. Paul regards the Corinthian Church as polluted by the presence of one single offender, until he was publicly expelled from its communion (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2, 6, 7</a>). The very words "body politic" applied to a state imply the same idea - that of a connection so intimate between the members of a community that the act of one affects the whole. And if this be admitted to be the case in ordinary societies, how much more so in the people of God, who were under His special protection, and had been specially set apart to His service? In the history of Achan, moreover, we read the history of secret sin, which, though unseen by any earthly eye, does nevertheless pollute the offender, and through him the Church of God, by lowering his general standard of thought and action, enfeebling his moral sense, checking the growth of his inner and devotional life, until, by a resolute act of repentance and restitution towards God, the sin is finally acknowledged and put away. "A lewd man is a pernicious creature. That he damnes his own soule is the least part of his misehiefe; he commonly drawes vengeance upon a thousand, either by the desert of his sinne, or by the infection" (Bp. Hall).

The latter, from the mention of Michmash in the route of Sennacherib immediately afterwards, is probably the same as Ai. Robinson and Hell - the former very doubtfully - place it at Turmus Aya, an eminence crowned with ruins above Deir Duwan. But Vandevelde contests this, and places it at Tell-el-Hajar, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Tell or heap of ruins; and G. Williams and Capt. Wilson have independently fixed on the same spot, though they call it et-Tel, or "the heap," and suppose the "el-Hajar" to have been added in answer to the question, "what heap?" This situation seems best to suit the requirements of the narrative. For it is "on the southern brow of the Wady-el-Mutyah" (Vandevelde), near that "wild entanglement of hill and valley at the head of the Wady Harith," which "climbs into the heart of the mountains of Benjamin till it meets the central ridge of the country at Bethel" (Stanley, 'Sinai and Palestine,' p. 202). Its situation, unlike that of Turmus Aya, is calculated to give cover to an ambush of 5,000 men, and it also answers to the conditions in its nearness to Michmash, from which Turmus Aya is more than three hours' journey distant. The Tell is "covered with heaps of ruins" (Capt. Wilson, 'Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement,' 4. p. 124). Conder, however ('Handbook,' p. 254), identifies Ai with Haiyan, two miles from Bethel, in the same Wady, but why, he gives no hint. A fortress so situated was one which Joshua could not leave in his rear, and so its capture was a matter of necessity. By its position, if not from the number of its inhabitants, it was necessarily a very strong one. Ai is mentioned as early as <a href="../../par/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>, and we find that it was inhabited down to the Captivity, for the "men of Bethel and Ai" are mentioned (and, it may be observed, in close proximity to those of Rama, Geba, and Michmash - see <a href="../../par/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a> above cited) in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a>. See also <a href="../../par/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, above cited. The name Ai, or ruins, found so early, implies that the aboriginal inhabitants had built a city in that almost inaccessible situation. Lieut. Conder gives a very vivid description of the site et-Tel in 'Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement,' April, 1874. There are, he says, "huge mounds of broken stone and shingle ten feet high. The town," he adds, "must have been pounded small, and the fury of its destruction is still evidenced by its completeness." He continues: "The party for the ambush, following the ancient causeway from Bethel to Jordan (which we have recovered throughout its entire length) as far as Michmash, would then easily ascend the great wady west of Ai, and arrive within a quarter of a mile of the city without having ever come in sight of it. Here, hidden by the knoll of Burjums and the high ground near it, a force of almost any magnitude might wait unsuspected. The main body in the meanwhile, without diverging from the road, would ascend the gently sloping valley and appear before the town on the open battlefield which stretches away to its east and south. From the knoll the figure of Joshua would be plainly visible to either party, with his spear stretched against the sky" [see ch Joshua 8:18). But the site still eludes investigation. Lieut. Kitchener, Mr. Birch, Mr. Guest, would place it at Kh-Haiy, or the rock Rimmon. When those who have visited the country are so divided in opinion, nothing but silence remains for those who have not. <span class="cmt_word">Beth-avern</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23</a>). This place has not yet been identified. It was close by Ai, and not far from Bethel, as the transference of its name to Bethel by Hosea (Hosea 4:15; 5:8; 10:5) shows. It could not have been a place of any importance, or the historian would not have found it necessary to explain where it was. Hosea has perhaps derived his knowledge of it from this passage. Some writers have identified it with Bethel. But this is obviously incorrect, since the literal rendering of the Hebrew here places Ai "in the immediate proximity of Beth-aven, <span class="accented">eastward</span> of Bethel." The LXX. omits all reference to Beth-aven. But there are many various readings. Bethel Formerly Luz (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-7.htm">Genesis 35:7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-23.htm">Judges 1:23</a>). The last-cited passage seems to prove that Bethel was not among, the cities taken during Joshua's campaign; though this is extraordinary in the face of the fact that the inhabitants of Luz gave their assistance to the men of Ai in the battle (see <a href="../../par/joshua/8-17.htm">Joshua 8:17</a>, where, however, it is remarkable that the LXX. omits all reference to Bethel). We may observe that there is no mention of the capture of Bethel, or the destruction of the inhabitants, and that this exactly agrees with <a href="../../par/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22-26</a>. This is an undesigned coincidence well worthy of note. We may also remark on the exact conformity between the situation of Bethel as described here and in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-8.htm">Genesis 12:8</a>. The city to which the name Bethel was attached was not the place of Abraham's altar, as we learn from the passage just cited, but was in its immediate neighbourhood. The ruins which now mark its site are of a later date than the events recorded in Scripture. Its modern name is Beitin. <span class="cmt_word">Go up and view the country.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">spy</span> (or <span class="accented">reconnoitre</span>); literally, <span class="accented">foot</span> the country. Joshua does not refuse to avail himself of human expedients because he is under Divine guidance (see also ch. 2). The reasons for this reconnoitring expedition are made clear enough by the passage quoted from Lieut. Condor's survey above.

But it may be paralleled by the conduct of most Christians in adversity. How few are there who can bear even temporal calamity calmly and patiently, even though they have abundant reason to know that temporal affliction is not only no sign of the displeasure of God, but the reverse! And when, through allowing secret sin to lurk within the soul, the Christian is overcome and brought to shame by his spiritual enemies, how much more seldom it is that he has the courage to gird up the loins of his soul and renew the conflict, in full confidence that victory will be his in the end! How much more frequently does he despair of victory, wish he had never undertaken the Christian profession, give up his belief in the protecting care and guidance of God, and desist, at least for a time, from the good fight of faith, to his own serious injury and to the detriment of God's Church! "It is not," adds Calvin, "a new thing for pious minds, when they aspire to seek God with holy zeal, to obscure the light of faith by the vehemence and impetuosity of their affections. And in this way all prayers would be rendered valueless, did not the Lord in His boundless indulgence pardon them, and, wiping away all their stains, receive them as if they were pure. And yet while in thus freely expostulating they cast all their care upon God, this blunt simplicity, though it needs pardon, is yet far more acceptable than the feigned modesty and self restraint of the hypocrites."

This plain statement disposes of the idea that the repulse before Ai was simply the result of Joshua's rashness in sending so small a body of troops.

Not a hint is dropped that the former number of men was insufficient, or that Joshua had been misled by the information brought by the reconnoitring party.

According to the families. The gradual centering of the suspicion upon the offender is one of the most striking features of the history. The genealogies of the children of Israel were very strictly kept, as the Books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah show. Achan's name is carefully given in the genealogy of Judah in 1 Chronicles if. 7. The subdivision of the tribes into families (or <span class="accented">clans</span>, Keil) and households (or, as we should perhaps say, <span class="accented">families</span>) was for convenience of enumeration, military organisation, and perhaps of assessment. Oehler, 'Theologie des Allen Testaments,' Sec. 101, takes the same view as Keil. The tribes, he says, were divided into <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x5c3;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, Geschlechter (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, for which the best English equivalent is <span class="accented">clans</span>, as above); these into families or houses (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>), or fathers' hours (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>); and these again into single heads of a house (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). The principle, he adds of a Mosaic family, is as follows: Every <span class="accented">"family"</span> forms a distinct whole, which as far as possible must be maintained in its integrity. Each tribe, says Jahn ('Hebrew Commonwealth,' Book II.), acknowledged a prince (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>) as its ruler. As its numbers increased, there arose a subdivision of the tribe into collections of families. Such a collection was called a house of fathers, a <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> or clan, or a thousand, rut this explanation is not so satisfactory as that given above. Kurz remarks on the important part family life played among the Hebrews, with whom, in consequence of their descent from Abraham, and the importance they attached to it, the nation was developed out of the family.

Joshua feels for the criminal, even though he is forced to put him to death. So in cur own day the spectacle is not uncommon of a judge melted to tears as he passes sentence of death on the murderer. The expression seems almost to imply a belief that, though Achan must undergo the extremest penalty of the law in this world, Joshua entertained a hope that he might be forgiven in the next. It certainly proves that, stern as the law of Moses was, it was felt, at least in those early days, to be rather against the sin than the sinner that its severity was directed. In commenting upon the severity of the Mosaic covenant, whether towards offenders against its provisions or against the Canaanites, we must remember Bishop Butler's caution, that in this world we see but a very small portion of the whole counsel of God. Give glory to the Lord Cod of Israel, and make confession unto Him. Literally, <span class="accented">offer</span> (or <span class="accented">impute</span>) <span class="accented">glory to the Lord God of Israel, </span> and <span class="accented">give</span> confession (or <span class="accented">praise</span>) unto Him (cf. <a href="../../par/john/9-24.htm">John 9:24</a>).

The Babylonish mantle was famed for its beauty (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span>, LXX.), and was, no doubt, worked artistically with figures of men and animals. "Of all Asiatic nations, the Babylonians were the most noted for the weaving of cloth of divers colours. Into these stuffs gold threads were introduced into the woof of many hues. Amongst those who traded in 'blue clothes and embroidered work' with Tyro were the merchants of Asshur, or Assyria; and that the garments of Babylon were brought into Syria and greatly esteemed at a very early period, we learn from their being classed amongst the most precious articles of spoil, even with gold, in the time of Joshua" (Layard, 'Nineveh,' II. 413). From this, among other passages, we may infer the early date of the Book of Joshua. It marks an early stage of civilisation when an embroidered garment can be considered as in any degree equivalent to gold. The Israelites, it must be remembered, were not unaccustomed in Egypt to the highest degree of civilisation then known. "Nam Persarum, finitimarumque gentium luxum eo se ostentare solere vel ex eo constat quod captis ab Alexandro Magno Susis illicinventa fuerit 10 millia pondo, sive talents purpurae Hermionicae, teste Plutarcho in Alexandro" (Corn. a Lapide). <span class="cmt_word">A wedge of gold.</span> Literally, "a <span class="accented">tongue</span> of gold."

It has been suggested that the former word signifies to stone a living person, the second to heap up stones upon a dead one; and this derives confirmation from the fact that the former word has the signification of piling up, while the latter rather gives the idea of the weight of the pile. Some have gathered from the use of the singular here, that Achan only was stoned; but the use of the plural immediately afterwards implies the contrary, unless, with Knobel, we have recourse to the suggestion that "them" is a "mistake of the Deuteronomist" for "him." It is of course possible that his family were only taken there to witness the solemn judgment upon their father. But the use of the singular and plural in Hebrew is frequently very indefinite (see <a href="../../par/judges/11-17.htm">Judges 11:17, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/66-6.htm">Psalm 66:6</a>.

"Treacherous Israelites are to be dreaded more than malicious Canaanites" (Matthew Henry). <span class="cmt_word">Take all the people of wax with thee.</span> Not, as has been before stated, because 3,000 men were too few to take the city, for the capture of Jericho was a far greater marvel than that of Ai with this number of men. The true reason is indicated by Calvin, and is indeed suggested by the words "Fear not, neither be thou dismayed." It was to reassure the people, whose hearts had "melted and become as water." Sometimes God calls upon His people for a display of faith, as when He led them through the Jordan, or commanded them to compass Jericho seven days. But in days of despondency He compassionates their weakness and permits them to rely upon visible means of support (see also below, ver. 3). Matthew Henry thinks that a tacit rebuke is here administered to Joshua for sending so few men to Ai on the frowner occasion. He ought to have permitted all to have shared the toil and glory. <span class="cmt_word">I have given into thy hand.</span> The work, let man do his best, is God's after all. <span class="cmt_word">The king.</span> For the political condition of Palestine before the Israelitish invasion see Introduction. <span class="cmt_word">And his land.</span> As in the case of the early Germanic peoples, there was a certain portion of their land in the neigbourhood attached to each city which was used for agricultural purposes (see Introduction; also <a href="../../par/joshua/13-28.htm">Joshua 13:28</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/14-4.htm">Joshua 14:4</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-2.htm">Joshua 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Only the spoil thereof.</span> Ai was not solemnly devoted, like Jericho, though (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16, 17</a>) the Canaanitish people were. <span class="cmt_word">Behind it.</span> Joshua was advancing from the southeast. The ambush (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> literally, "a lier in wait," here a band of liers in wait, the word itself originally signifying <span class="accented">to plait, weave</span>, hence to <span class="accented">design</span>) was therefore (ver. 12) on the opposite, or west side of the city. The question which has been raised whether God could rightly command a stratagem seems scarcely to require discussion. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-3.htm">Joshua 8:3</a></div><div class="verse">So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thirty thousand.</span> In ver. 12 we read 5,000, and this must be the true reading. Thirty thousand men could hardly have been posted, without detection, in the ravines around Ai, whereas we are informed by travellers that there would have been no difficulty in concealing 5,000 men there. See, however, the passage cited from Lieut. Conder's Report in the note on Joshua 7:2. The confused condition of the numbers in the present text of the Old Testament is a well known fact, and it is proved by the great discrepancies in this respect between the Books of Chronicles and those of Samuel and Kings. Some have thought (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Haverniek, 'Introduction to the Old Testament,' II. 1:15) that <span class="accented">two</span> bands were laid in ambush, one on the northwest and the other on the southwest. This is a possible, though not probable, solution of the difficulty (see below). Then we must suppose that the city was nearly surrounded, Joshua and the main body on the southeast, the larger detachment on the north (ver. 13), and the smaller ambush on the west (see note on ver. 13). Keil, in his earlier editions, supposed that Joshua assaulted Ai with 30,000 men, out of whom he chose 5,000 as an ambush. So also Hengstenberg's 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 219. But this only introduces a third contradiction, for we are told both in vers. 1 and 3 that Joshua took with him "all the men of war." Keil has, however, abandoned that supposition, which is contrary to all the ancient versions, including the present text of the LXX. The Bishop of Lincoln suggests that 5,000 men may have been detached to reinforce the former detachment of 30,000. But to say nothing of the improbability of an ambush of 35,000 men remaining undetected (and they were specially instructed - see next verse - not to station themselves far from the city), we have the plain statement in ver. 12 <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> "he stationed (or <span class="accented">had stationed</span>) them as an ambush."

But the Ai mentioned in <a href="../../par/ezra/2-28.htm">Ezra 2:28</a> may have been a city built, not on precisely the same spot, but near enough to it to take its name. And if Ai signifies ruins, and Dean Stanley be right in regarding it as referring to ruins in the days of the Philistines, the name would be particularly suitable to this particular city. Travellers have identified the place with Tel-el. Hajar, immediately to the south of the Wady Mutyah.

The LXX. does not introduce it here, but after <a href="../../par/joshua/9-2.htm">Joshua 9:2</a>. For other authorities see below. It is very easy to see why its genuineness has been disputed. The Book of Joshua has many marks of having been written not so very long after the events described in it. But it has been a favourite opinion with the school which disputes the authenticity of the books of the Bible, that Deuteronomy was a late revision by Ezra of the law of Moses, though this (see Introduction) has lately been discarded for another hypothesis. But we have, if the present passage be genuine, a distinct proof that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy is here quoted as the "book of the law of Moses" (cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9, 24, 26</a>). The grounds on which the genuine. ness of the passage has been denied are these: First, the passage begins with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> followed by an imperfect, or future, as does the interpolated passage in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>. This is Maurer's theory. But in this case we must reject every passage which begins thus, and certainly we should do so on grounds which, to say the least, are very slender. Next, we are told that Joshua could not have ventured to trust himself so far in the heart of a hostile country. But why not? Gerizim was not more than twenty miles from Ai. The Canaanites, we are told, were panic stricken at Joshua's success. The Gibeonites were not disposed to offer any hindrance to his progress; on the contrary, they hastened to form an alliance with him. And these solemn religious rites, performed by a people so clearly under the protection of the Most High, were more likely to increase than lessen the awe felt by the surrounding tribes. The only difficulty is that the women and children (v. 35) are expressly said to have gone thither also, and it seems improbable that they, whom we have supposed to have been left under a guard at Gilgal, should have been brought so far while the country was as yet unsubdued. And the difficulty is increased by finding Joshua again at Gilgal in <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>. But there is the hypothesis that this was another Gilgal to fall back upon, and this (see note on the passage just mentioned) is an extremely probable one. The suggestion of many commentators, that the passage has been transposed, is of course possible. We can only leave the difficulty unsolved, as one which a fuller knowledge of the facts, could we obtain it, would clear up at once. But we may be sure that if the passage were an interpolation, some explanation would have been given of the circumstances which seem to us so perplexing. And on the other hand we must remember that, as has been already contended, the notion that the whole camp of Israel performed this journey at a time when stupefaction had seized upon the Canaanitish tribes, though involving some amount of impossibility, is by no means impossible. (See also note on ver. 33). A number of extraordinary interpretations of this passage have been given. A favourite Rabbinical interpretation (see note on next verse) was that this altar was erected on the very day on which the Israelites crossed the Jordan. This was of course a physical impossibility. Josephus, on the contrary, supposes that five years elapsed before its erection, while Rabbi Israel, in the Jerusalem Talmud, thinks that it was deferred until after the expiration of fourteen years, and after the land had been divided. So Masius <span class="accented">in loc.<span class="cmt_word"></span> In Mount Ebal.</span> Between it and Gerizim stood the city of Shechem, or Sychar, as it is called in St. <a href="../../par/john/4.htm">John 4</a>. Gerizim was close to this city, as <a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 7</a> and St. <a href="../../par/john/4-20.htm">John 4:20</a> testify, as well as <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>. Dr. Maclear, in the 'Cambridge Bible for Schools,' suggests that the Israelites took this opportunity of interring the bones of Joseph (<a href="../../par/genesis/1-25.htm">Genesis 1:25, 26</a>) in the piece of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>). (See <a href="../../par/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/8-31.htm">Joshua 8:31</a></div><div class="verse">As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up <i>any</i> iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded</span> (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4, 5</a>). Here, and in ver. 33, we find the writer making an extract from the Book of Deuteronomy. As has been before said, the natural explanation is that the Book of Joshua was written after the Book of Deuteronomy, and that the Book of Deuteronomy was written by Moses, or how could Joshua have carried out instructions which had never been given? The Elohist, Jehovist, and Denteronomist theory supposes the compiler of the Book of Joshua to have done his work in so perfunctory a fashion, that it is quite possible for critics living at a distance of three thousand years and more to detect the various fragments of which his mosaic is constructed. He is so void of common sense as to have inserted this narrative in a place so obviously unsuitable that it involves a palpable contradiction to probability and common sense, and this when he could have placed it in a dozen other parts of the book where no such improbability would be involved. Yet, in spite of the incredible carelessness with which he put his materials together, we are required to believe that "the Deuteronomist" had the foresight to insert the fulfilment of the command of Moses which he had invented in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-26.htm">Deuteronomy 11:26-30</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1-26</a>; and that in so doing he abbreviated the narrative so as to leave out many details of his own invention. Now, under the supposition of a later fabrication of supplementary observances to be imposed upon the children of Israel, it is hardly probable that the account of the plaster with which the stones were to be plastered, and the enumeration of the tribes and the curses, would be omitted, since by the hypothesis the object of the Deuteronomist was to secure implicit obedience to the sacerdotal enactments he was inventing. But on the hypothesis of the genuineness of both writings everything fits in naturally enough. <span class="cmt_word">An altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any iron.</span> As though to intimate (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-25.htm">Exodus 20:25</a>) that all should be natural and spontaneous in the worship of God, and that as little of human devising should be introduced as possible. The altar must be raised by man, but the principles of the worship must not be devised by him. This interpretation, however, is rejected by Calvin, who thinks that all that was meant was to preclude the perpetual existence of the altar (though how the substitution of whole for hewn stones could effect this is not apparent); and Keil and Bahr ('Symbolik,' 1. pp. 487, 488),who think that the altar ought (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) properly to be of earth, since sacrifice is rendered necessary by man's earthly or carnal nature, and that unhewn stone is the only substitute for earth which is allowed. But surely man's handiwork is the offspring of his unregenerate nature, and therefore may, from this point of view, be rightly employed in sacrifice. Hengstenberg ('Gesehichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 223) thinks that the reason of the command was that, since only one place of worship was permitted for all Israel, an altar had sometimes to be hastily thrown up. But when we consider the symbolic character of the Mosaic worship, we are compelled to reject this interpretation as unsatisfactory. Benjamin of Tudela (see Drusius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) appears to have supposed that these stones were those which had been taken out of Jordan. Masius devotes considerable space to the refutation of this opinion (see also note on last verse). <span class="cmt_word">And they offered thereon.</span> Delitzsch remarks on the inversion of the order here, as compared with <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>. But this is obviously the true order. The worship would naturally precede the ceremony rather than follow it.

The outline was then sketched with red chalk, and afterwards corrected and filled in with black (Keurick's 'Egypt,' 1, p. 271). Thomson ('Land and the Book,' Io. 471) says that he has seen writings in plaster which could not have been less than two thousand years old. This passage shows that our author had <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2, 3</a> in his mind. The stones of the altar, which alone have been mentioned, are clearly not meant here, but the erection of plastered stone on which the law was to be written. <span class="cmt_word">A copy of the law of Moses,</span> "Deuteronomium legis," Vulgate.

It is to be observed that the word is definite, the copy, not a copy, of the law. This (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) was what was written on the two tables of stone, which (<a href="../../par/exodus/24-12.htm">Exodus 24:12</a>, 31:18) God gave to Moses. Yet it is possible that, as some commentaters suggest, and as ver. 34 may be held to imply, what is meant is the curses and blessings mentioned in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27</a>, and 28. The formal setting up of this memorial was intended to remind the Israelites, by a perpetual standing witness, of the conditions on which they held the land of Canaan. And it is to be observed that the moral, rather than the positive, precepts of the law were thus solemnly enjoined on them, since neglect of the moral law of God is the invariable source of national degradation and decay. <span class="cmt_word">Which he wrote.</span> Namely, Joshua.

We need not, therefore, assume as a matter of course that the whole people, men, women, and children, were taken up to Shechem to behold this ceremony. It is quite possible that during all Joshua's marches and campaigns a large number of the people remained under guard at Gilgal (see <a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>), which remained the headquarters of the Israelites until the country was subdued. All that is here meant is that a very great number of the people were gathered together, and that every tribe, every age, and each sex were largely represented at this important ceremony. <span class="cmt_word">And officers.</span> Shoterim (see <a href="../../par/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Half of them.</span> Origen's explanation of the spiritual meaning of this passage is noteworthy, even though somewhat farfetched. He regards those of the tribes who stood on Mount Gerizim to bless, as the type of those who are led, not by fear of God's threatenings, but by a longing for God's promises and blessings; those who stood on Mount Ebal to curse, as the type of those who are driven by the fear of punishment to obey the will of God, and these finally attain salvation. The former, he adds, are the more noble of the two; but Jesus, who reads the hearts, gives each their proper station, and places some on Mount Ebal to curse, not that they themselves may receive the curse, but, by regarding the curse pronounced on sinners, may learn thereby how to escape it. <span class="cmt_word">Over against.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> rather, "in the direction off" The command in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-12.htm">Deuteronomy 27:12</a> is that they shall stand upon the two mountains. No doubt certain representatives of the tribes stood on the mountain, and the rest of the people at the foot of the mountain, on either side of the valley, "crowding the slopes," as Canon Tristram says. The valley is narrow here, and the voice in mountainous regions, where the air is rarer, carries far. Under special circumstances, such as frosty weather, the voices of men crying their wares have been distinctly heard across the Humber in our own country. And in mountain passes, as any one who has travelled in them may easily ascertain, conversations may be carried on from opposite sides of a valley or ravine without the slightest difficulty. In this particular place Canon Tristram tell us ('Land of Israel,' pp. 149, 150) that when on Mount Gerizim he heard every word uttered by a man who was then driving his ass down Mount Ebal, and that afterwards two of his party recited the commandments antiphonally from the two sides of the valley without the least difficulty.

Gibeon was a city of some importance (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-2.htm">Joshua 10:2</a>). Though it was for size and importance "as one of the royal cities," we hear nothing of a king there. Hengstenberg, in his history, describes it (p. 227) as "eine freie Stadt," with daughter cities dependent on it. In fact, the Phoenician cities (see Introduction) seem to have had as great a variety of constitution as those of ancient Greece. Its inhabitants were Hivites (ver. 7, and <a href="../../par/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>). Its name (compare Gibeah and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> a hill) signifies hill city, like the termination <span class="accented">dunum</span> in Latin, as Lugdunum, or Lyons; <span class="accented">dune</span> in Anglo-Saxon, as <span class="accented">Ethandune.</span> Compare also Dunkirk. Robinson, in his 'Biblical Researches,' 2:135-9, identifies it with el-Jib, a village on an eminence in the midst of a fertile plain, where the remains of large buildings may still be seen. (So Vandevelde and Condor.) "Onely the Hivites are wiser than their fellowes, and will rather yeeld and live. Their intelligence was not diverse from the rest; all had equally heard of the miraculous conduct and successe of Israel; but their resolution was diverse. As Rahab saved her family in the midst of Jericho, so these foure cities preserved themselves in the midst of Canaan; and both of them by beleeving what God would do. The efficacie of God's marvellous works is not in the acts themselves, but in our apprehension" (Bp. Hall).

The Gibeonites also acted upon what they had heard, but they preferred an accommodation to war. So Calvin and Rosenmuller; also Drusius. And they felt that they could only effect their purpose by craft. Other explanations are given, such as that a reference is made to Joshua's stratagem at Ai. Keil rejects both, and proposes an explanation of his own, which is unintelligible. Origen's interpretation here is interesting as a specimen of the theology of the third century. He regards the Gibeonites as the type of men who, though they are enrolled in the Church as believers and have faith in God, and acquiesce in all the Divine precepts, and are ready enough to take part in all the external duties of religion, are yet involved in vices and foulnesses, like the Gibeonites in their old garments and clouted shoes. They display no signs of improvement or alteration, yet Jesus our Lord concedes to them salvation, even though that salvation does not escape a certain stigma of disgrace. That there may be some persons in a condition somewhat resembling this described by Origen may be admitted, but it is difficult to see how any one in a state of salvation can display no signs of improvement whatever. There are many who do not improve as they might, whom we should yet hesitate to pronounce altogether reprobate from God. But surely the entire absence of all improvement is a manifest sign of reprobation. This passage is one of many among the voluminous works of Origen in which that holy and learned man has not sufficiently weighed what he was saying (see below, ver. 23). <span class="cmt_word">Made as if they had been ambassadors.</span> "Sent an embassy" (Luther). If we take this reading, we must suppose, with Grotius and others, the word to be the Hithpahel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> to go, to revolve. But the form is rare, and the word is elsewhere unknown, at least in Hebrew, though an Arabic form of it is found. It is therefore better to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> "they prepared themselves provisions." This is the reading of the LXX., the Vulgate, the Chaldee, the Syriac, and of most modern editors. It is rendered still more probable by the occurrence of the same word in ver. 12. <span class="cmt_word">Old sacks</span>. Rather, <span class="accented">worn out</span>, and so throughout the passage. The usual mode of conveyance still in the East is in sackcloth bags on the backs of horses, mules, camels, and asses. Such bags are apt to meet with rough usage in a long journey. <span class="cmt_word">Wine bottles.</span> Rather, <span class="accented">wine skins</span>, the wine then being kept in skins, not in vessels of glass. This explains how they could be burst open (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) and tied up. These skins were hung up frequently in the smoke (<a href="../../par/psalms/119-83.htm">Psalm 119:83</a>), which gave them a shrivelled appearance. The first bottles were made of such skins, as Herodotus tells us. The Egyptian monuments confirm his statements, displaying as they do skins of animals so used, with the legs or the neck forming what we still term the "neck" of the bottle (cf. Homer, Iliad, 4:247, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). Similar bottles are depicted on the walls of Herculaneum and Pompeii, and the like may be seen still in Italian villages. They were pitched over at the seams to prevent leakage (cf. <a href="../../par/job/32-19.htm">Job 32:19</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/9-17.htm">Matthew 9:17</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/2-22.htm">Mark 2:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-37.htm">Luke 5:37, 38</a>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the camp at Gilgal.</span> Many commentators, among whom we may number Vandevelde and the recent Palestine Exploration Expedition, suppose that the Gilgal mentioned here is <span class="accented">another</span> Gilgal, and certainly the supposition derives great force from the fact that there is a place the modern name of which is Jiljilia, situated near the oaks of Moreh, whose situation would be far more central, and would fall in better with the rest of the history (see notes on Joshua 8:30), than the original Gilgal. That such a second Gilgal is known to Jewish history would appear from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, where its situation is clearly pointed out as that of the modern Jiljilia, near the oaks of Moreh, and near theArabah (<span class="accented">champaign</span>, Authorised Version), which runs in that direction. Jiljulieh, in the plain of Sharon, is supposed by Vandevelde and the Palestine explorers (see 'Quarterly Statement,' Jan., 1879) to be a <span class="accented">third</span> Gilgal, and Jerome, in his 'Onomasticon,' has identified it (see note on Joshua 12:23). The Gilgal in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-4.htm">1 Samuel 13:4-12</a> seems to require a central position like that of Jiljilia, rather than a place near the fords of Jordan. As Ewald reminds us, the earlier Gilgal lay out of the road from Jericho to Bethel (see also <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1-6</a>). The only argument against such a second Gilgal is the improbability of a removal of the camp without any mention of such removal by the historian (see Hengstenberg, 'Geschichte des Reiches Gottes,' p. 207), and the improbability of there having been a second Gilgal as the place of encampment of the Israelites. It is possible, however, that the second great place of encampment received the memorable name of the first, from the keen sense that the Israelitish encampment was the abode of a people from which the "reproach of Egypt" was forever rolled away. Another explanation is suggested by a comparison of <a href="../../par/joshua/15-7.htm">Joshua 15:7</a> with <a href="../../par/joshua/18-17.htm">Joshua 18:17</a> (see note on the former passage). The second Gilgal, if it really existed, was well suited for its purpose. "It was in the centre of the country, situated upon a steep hill, with a good table land at the top, and commanded a most extensive prospect of the large plain in the west, and also towards the north and east" (Keil) - precisely the place which an able general would be likely to select. Though "in a high position" (Vandevelde), it was "lower than Gibeon," and was "an hour west of Sinjil on the Jerusalem Shechem road." Its situation enabled Joshua to strike a decisive blow without delay (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7, 9</a>). It is clear that this suggestion entirely obviates the difficulty of the concluding verses of ch. 8. And as the name implies a circular form as well as motion, and early camps were usually circular, it may have been the ordinary name for an encampment among the Hebrews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the men of Israel said.</span> The Keri here has the singular number instead of the Chethibh plural, in consequence of Israel speaking of itself collectively in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> and of the singular <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>.

Their object, as Grotius remarks, was rather to form an alliance on terms of something like equality. The phrase was one common in the East as a token of respect (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/32-4.htm">Genesis 32:4, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-18.htm">Genesis 50:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-5.htm">2 Kings 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>). But no doubt the Gibeonites (see ver. 11) expected to have a tribute laid on them. And they would willingly accept such an impost, for, as Ewald remarks ( 'History of Israel,' 4:3), their object was "to secure the peace which a mercantile inland city especially requires" (see also note on Joshua 3:10). <span class="cmt_word">From whence come ye?</span> Joshua uses the imperfect, not the perfect, tense here. Commentators are divided about its meaning. Some suppose that the perfect, "from whence have ye come?" is mere direct and abrupt than "from whence may you have come?" or, "from whence were you coming?" and certainly an indirect question is in most languages considered more respectful than a direct one (see <a href="../../par/genesis/42-7.htm">Genesis 42:7</a>). But perhaps with Ewald we may regard it simply as implying that their mission was still in progress. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/9-9.htm">Joshua 9:9</a></div><div class="verse">And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said unto him.</span> "I commend their wisdom in seeking peace; I do not commend their falsehood in the manner of seeking it. Who can looke for any better in pagans?" (Bp. Hall.) It is worthy of the craft of the Gibeonites that they evade the first question, and as it is of vital importance to the success of their mission, they throw their whole force upon the second. The course of conduct enjoined on Joshua had reached the ears of the Canaanitish peoples, as we learn from ver. 24. They also take good care to say nothing of the more recent successes of the Israelites. With consummate astuteness they confine themselves to the successes "beyond Jordan." No wonder such mastery of the arts of deceit should have imposed on the Israelites. But inasmuch as the historian lacked the stimulus of that "necessity" which is proverbially "the mother of invention," we must recognise here a sign of the genuineness of the narrative.

In <a href="../../par/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. Edrei only is mentioned. This is not the Ashtaroth-Karnaim of <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>, which is so called from the worship of the horned Astarte, or crescent (see below), to distinguish it from this Ashtaroth. The two cities were close together. Eusebius and Jerome state that they were only nine miles apart. The site of this city has been identified with Tel Ashtereh, in a wide plain on the east of Jordan. It appears as Astaratu in the Karnak list of cities captured by Thothines III. The name has been identified with the Assyrian <span class="accented">Ishtar</span>, the Persian, Greek, and Latin <span class="accented">aster</span> and our star. So Gesenius, 'Thesaurus,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> Whence Lucian seems to have been wrong in his idea that the worship of Astarte, like that of Artemis at Ephesus, was that of the moon. But Rawlinson, in his 'Ancient Monarchies,' decides against this identification. The last mention of this city in Jewish history is in the bold and successful expedition of Judas Maccabaeus into Gilead, in which he penetrated as far as this city (called Kar-naim), and brought the Jews residing there and in the neighbourhood to Jerusalem (1 Macc. 6.). Kuenen, in his 'History of the Religion of Israel,' makes a distinction between the worship of Ashtaroth and of Asherah. The former he regards as the worship of the moon, and a pure worship; the latter of Venus, and an impure one. But though Asherah and Ashtaroth, or Ashtoreth, are undoubtedly distinct, yet both worships may have been impure, as the worship of Artemis of the Ephesians (the <span class="accented">Diana Multimamma</span>, or the image of fecundity) unquestionably was. "It is probable," says Mr. G. Smith, "that the first intention in the mythology was only to represent love as heaven born, but in time a more sensual view prevailed, and the worship of Ishtar became one of the darkest features in Babylonian mythology." The Babylonian Mylitta, or Venus, was worshipped under a crescent form, as Babylonian sculptures prove. A Syrian altar with the crescent on it is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge. It has a female figure on one side, with the crescent, and a male figure - of Baal, no doubt - on the other. Another is mentioned in a late able article in the <span class="accented">Times</span>, as having been found in Carehemish, the Hittite capital. The Chaldaean astronomers had, no doubt, discovered the use of telescopes (though in the translucent sky of Chaldaea perhaps the crescent Venus might be seen without them), for we find Saturn represented on their monuments with a ring (see Proctor, 'Saturn and his System,' p. 197). Consequently the worship of the crescent Venus involves no anachronism. Asherah, often wrongly translated "grove" in our version (see <a href="../../par/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25</a>), is probably the goddess Fortune, derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>, happiness. Ashtaroth is spelt not with Aleph, but with Ain.

The natural explanation - though several others are given, for which see Keil <span class="accented">in loc. -</span> would seem to be that the Israelites relied on the evidence of their senses, instead of upon the counsel of God. They could see the condition of the garments, sacks, and wine skins of the Gibeonites. They tasted of their victuals to convince themselves of the truth of those statements of which the sight was insufficient to take cognisance. <span class="cmt_word">And asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord.</span> Even in the most obvious matter it is well not to trust too implicitly to our own judgment. Nothing could seem more clear or satisfactory than the account given of themselves by the Gibeonites - nothing more easy for the unassisted intellect to decide. And yet Joshua and the congregation were deceived. It is perhaps too much to say, with some commentators - Maurer, for instance - that Joshua disobeyed a plain command in acting thus. The passage in which Joshua is instructed to "stand up before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him at the judgment of Urim before the Lord" (<a href="../../par/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>), does not require him to do so in all cases. But it was clearly "an act of gross carelessness" (Calvin). And the inference may safely be drawn that in no case whatever is it wise to trust to ourselves. However obvious our course may be, we shall do well to take counsel with God by prayer.

Keil remarks that we need not suppose that the three days were consumed on the march. Not only did Joshua, when celerity was necessary, perform the journey in a single night, but the whole distance was not more than eighteen or twenty miles, if we accept the hypothesis of a second Gilgal. <span class="cmt_word">Now their cities were.</span> Beeroth still exists, we are told, as el-Bireh (Robinson 2:132. So also Vaudcvelde and Conder). Jerome identified it with a place only seven miles from Jerusalem, which is an obvious error. It contains nearly 700 inhabitants, and is only about twenty minutes' walk from el-Jib, or Gibeon. Kirjath-jearim (the name means <span class="accented">the city of forests</span>) is well known in the history of Israel (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/judges/18-12.htm">Judges 18:12</a>). But it is, chiefly remarkable for the twenty years sojourn of the ark there (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2</a>). It was also known by the name of Baalah, Kirjath-Baal (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 60</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>). The Hivites seem to have been removed thence (probably to Gibeon), for there is no trace of any non-Jewish element in the population in the account of the reception of the ark among them (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6.htm">1 Samuel 6</a>.). It is called Baale of Judah in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/18-15.htm">Joshua 18:15</a>). The Jewish population seems to be due to one of the posterity of Caleb (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-50.htm">1 Chronicles 2:50-53</a>). Modern explorers, with the exception of Lieut. Conder, have identified Kirjath-jearim with Kuriet-el-Enab, "the city of the grape," about four miles from el-Jib, or Gibeon. This is the opinion of Robinson and Vandevelde. Supposing it to be near Beth-shemesh, on the authority of Josephus, Lieut. Conder places it at 'Arma, west of Bethlehem, and identifies the waters of Nepbtoah with a fountain nearly due south of the valley of giants or Rephaim (see <a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9</a>). But this is too far from Gibeon. He identifies Kuriet-el-Enab with Kirjath in <a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>, and regards this as one of the cities of Benjamin within the border. But this Kirjath may be Kirjath-jearim, and may as reasonably, standing on the border, be accounted to belong to both tribes, as Zorah, Eshtaol (mentioned in the boundaries of Judah and Dan), Beth-arahah, possibly Gibeah or Gibeath (belonging to Judah and Benjamin), and even Jerusalem itself (see <a href="../../par/joshua/15-53.htm">Joshua 15:53</a>). The identification of Kirjath-jearim with Kuriet-el-Enab, of the waters of Nephtoah with Ain Lifta, giving a line running northwestward from the valley of Rephaim, seems more probable as the border of Judah and Benjamin, and the word "compassed," or rather deflected, adds probability to this interpretation (see <a href="../../par/joshua/15-9.htm">Joshua 15:9, 10</a>, and notes). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/joshua/9-18.htm">Joshua 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the children of Israel smote them not.</span> There is great difference of opinion among the commentators as to whether this oath were binding off the Israelites or not. This difference is to be found among Roman Catholics as well as Protestants, and Cornelius a Lapide gives the ingenious and subtle arguments used on both sides by the Jesuit commentators. Many contend that as it was obtained by fraud, and especially by a representation that the Gibeonites did not belong to the tribes which Joshua was specially commanded to destroy (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-18</a>, with which compare the passages cited in note on ver. 7), it was null and void, <span class="accented">ab initio.</span> But the Israelites had sworn by the sacred name of Jehovah to spare the Gibeonites. It would have been to degrade that sacred name, and possibly (ver. 20) to bring trouble on themselves, to break that oath under any pretence whatever. If they had been deceived the fault was their own. The Jehovah by whom they swore had provided them with a ready mode of detecting such deceit, had they chosen to use it. Calvin, though he thinks the princes of the congregation were unnecessarily scrupulous, remarks on the superiority of Israelitish to Roman morals. It would have been easy enough for the congregation to argue, as the Romans did after the disaster at the Candine Forks, that the agreement was of no effect, because it was not made with the whole people. Cicero, however, had no sympathy with such morality. He writes ('De Officiis,' 1:13), "Atque etiam si quid singuli temporibus adducti, hosti promiserunt, est in eo ipso tides conservanda." And not a few instances of similar perfidy since the promulgation of Christianity may lead us to the conclusion that the example of Israel trader Joshua is not yet superfluous. As instances of such perfidy, we may adduce the battle of Varna, in 1444, in which Ladislaus, king of Hungary, was induced by the exhortations of Cardinal Julian to break the truce he bad entered into with Amurath, sultan of the Turks. It is said in this case that Amurath, in his distress, invoked Jesus Christ to punish the perfidy of His disciples. Be that as it may, a signal defeat fitly rewarded their disregard of truth. Later instances may be drawn from the conflict between Spain and the Netherlands in the latter part of the sixteenth century, in which the Spaniards frequently and wantonly, in the supposed interests of religion, violated the articles of capitulation formally entered into with the insurgents. These breakers of their plighted word also found that "wrath was upon them;" that God would not prosper the arms of those who, professedly for His sake, were false to their solemn obligations. Both the princes, in the narrative before us, in withstanding the wrath of the congregation, and the congregation in yielding to their representations, present a spectacle of moral principle which few nations have surpassed. Cornelius a Lapide, after giving the opinions of others, as we have seen, and remarking on the opinion here followed as "probabilior," sums up in the following noble and manly words: "Disce hic quam sancte fides, praesertim jurata, sit servanda hosti, etiam impio et infideli. Fide enim sublata, evertitur omnis hominum contractus et societas, quae fidei quasi basi innititur, ut homines jam non homines, sed leones, tygrides, et ferae esse videantur." Would that his Church had always acted upon these insatiable principles of justice and morality! In after years a terrible famine visited the Israelites as a chastisement for the infringement of this agreement (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Murmured</span>.

The LXX. and Vulgate render as our version. <span class="cmt_word">Hewers of wood and drawers of water.</span> Some amount of casuistry has been displayed upon this passage. But the fairness of the proceeding seems clear enough. The Gibeonites had escaped death by a fraud. For that fraud they deserved punishment. Their lives were spared by virtue of a solemn oath. But equality of rights had never been promised them. They might think themselves well off if they escaped destruction, even though they might be condemned permanently to occupy a servile condition. They appear to have assisted at the tabernacle worship, since they were condemned to serve, not individual Israelites, but the congregation. Such was the office of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (Nethinhim <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the given or devoted) in the later history of Judah (see <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/2-43.htm">Ezra 2:43-54, 58, 70</a>; and Ezra 8:20. See also Drusius and Masius <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The latter discusses the question whether the Nethinim were really the Gibeonites, or whether David, as stated in <a href="../../par/ezra/8-20.htm">Ezra 8:20</a>, instituted a new order of persons to take their place. If the latter were the case, then we have a proof that the Book of Joshua was written anterior to the time of David. It seems quite possible that Saul (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>) had all but exterminated the Gibeonites, and that David was compelled to institute a new order in their stead. If this suggestion be correct, and it is far from improbable, we have here an undesigned coincidence strongly supporting the credit of the narrative, in the place of Knobel's insinuation, contained in the words, that "the Elohist in Saul's time gives no hint of this, although he took the greatest interest in the persons engaged in God's service." <span class="cmt_word">As the princes had promised them.</span> These words as they stand are unintelligible. No such promise had been given. The literal rendering is "as the princes" (see note on ver. 15) "said to them," by the mouth of Joshua, as recorded in ver. 23. The Syriac Version supplies some words here to make up for a supposed deficiency in the text. But this is not necessary. The repetition in vers. 23 and 27 is quite in the manner of the historian. Nor are the words "as the princes said to them" explicable on the supposition that the words after, "let them live," are the words of the princes (see note above).

But the Gibeonites were to be employed forever in servile work. Hewing of wood and drawing of water was a task frequently imposed on the strangers (probably captives) dwelling among the Israelites, as we learn from <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>. We are not directly told that, as Keil and others have stated, the "lowest of the people" had to perform this office. It is, however, implied that the stranger who performed it occupied the lowest social station in the community.
