But the kingdoms of Sheba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) and Saba (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>) are entirely distinct (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>), the latter being the name both of the capital and country of Meroe, a province of Ethopia (Joshua, Ant. 2:10. 2); while the former in like manner designates both the chief city and also the kingdom of the Sabeans (<a href="../../par/job/1-15.htm">Job 1:15</a>). This tribe would seem to have grown richer and stronger than all the other Arabian peoples by means of its commercial enterprise, and it was especially famed for its gold, gems, and spices (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="../../par/job/6-19.htm">Job 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a>). It is noticeable that in both kingdoms government by female sovereigns was not uncommon (cf. <a href="../../par/acts/8-27.htm">Acts 8:27</a>); but it is very remarkable to find any country under the rule of a queen at this early date. (The idea that either of these lands was <span class="accented">always</span> governed by queens has no real basis.)

This particular present was doubtless brought by the queen because she had heard of the extensive use made of it by Solomon, and of the enormous quantities he required.

That is to say, in addition to the fitting presents which he made in return for her gifts, he freely gave her whatsoever she asked for. To ask for a coveted thing is no breach of Oriental propriety. The Ethiopian Christians find in these words (and considering the character of Solomon and the license of that age, perhaps not altogether without reason) a basis for their belief that she bore Solomon a son, Melimelek by name, from whom, indeed, the present sovereigns of Abyssinia claim to derive their descent.] <span class="cmt_word">So</span> <span class="cmt_word">she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</span> Bishop Wordsworth has remarked (p. 44) that the record of this visit disappoints us.

"In like manner," he adds, "we hear nothing of any attempt on Solomon's part to improve his friendship and commercial relations with Hiram into an occasion for communicating the better merchandise of Divine truth to the Sidonians." But surely this criticism overlooks the fact that Judaism was not a missionary religion, and that the chosen people had no sort of commission to convert the heathen, It is, no doubt, a mystery; but it is a fact, that for 2,000 years the light of God's truth was, by the counsel and purpose of God, restricted within the extremely narrow confines of Israel, and that the "fulness of the time," when the Gentiles should be "fellow heirs," was distant from Solomon's day by a whole millennium., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 10:14-29. SOLOMON'S WEALTH, POMP, AND POWER. The visit of the Queen of Sheba, in itself a striking proof of the fame and greatness of Solomon, is followed by a description of his revenues, his throne, and various other particulars of his wealth and magnificence, some of which are related here because they were the products of the voyages of that same fleet which had been the means of acquainting the queen with Solomon and his glory.

It is possible, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the number of the beast is a reminiscence of this number of talents. For we may surely see in this statement of Solomon's prodigious wealth an indication of his worldliness, the turning point, perhaps, in his estrangement from God. "The love of money" may have been the root of all his evil. It is certainly remarkable that from this time forward his career is one of steady declension. It is also remarkable that while he is here represented to us as a "royal merchant," the mark of the beast is on the <span class="accented">buyers</span> and <span class="accented">sellers</span> (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-17.htm">Revelation 13:17</a>). But see "Expositor," May, 1881. It is, of course, possible that the number has been corrupted, but, on the other hand, it may have been recorded, partly because of the singularity of the sum total. The 666 talents include the receipts from all sources - taxes, tribute, and voyages - with the exception made presently (ver. 15). Rawlinson quotes Keil (in his earlier edition) as estimating this amount at &pound;3,646,350. But in his later work, Keil puts it in round numbers at two and a half millions (17,000,000 thalers), while Mr. Peele calculates it at about &pound;8,000,000. These widely varying figures are instructive, as showing that both estimates are little more than guesswork. We do not know the value of the Hebrew talent, nor, indeed, can it ever be rightly appraised until we know its purchasing power. The <span class="accented">denarius, e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, is generally valued at 8&frac12; d. (or 7&frac12; d.) because it contained some 58 grains of pure silver but its real <span class="accented">value</span> was nearer three shillings, inasmuch as it was a fair wage for a day's work on the land (<a href="../../par/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>).

Keil: "the kings of the mixed population" (mentioned <a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>. Cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>). Perhaps the words are best explained by <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-24.htm">Jeremiah 25:24</a>: "The kings of Arabia (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>) and ... of the mingled people (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>) that dwell in the desert," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the desert of <span class="accented">Arabia deserta</span>, bordering on Palestine.

No doubt these kings, who were great sheepmasters, paid their tribute in flocks of sheep and goats (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>], <span class="cmt_word">and of the governors of the country.</span> [The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. ch. 20:24) is a foreign word, perhaps Sanskrit, apparently borrowed by the Jews from the Persians. It is used of Tatnai (<a href="../../par/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6</a>), of Zerubbabel (<a href="../../par/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a>), and of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>). Probably our author, in whose day it was a familiar and well understood word, substituted it for some older Hebrew designation. But the office and character of these "governors" is more difficult to define than the name. Rawlinson thinks that, in some parts of the empire, the kings - the "empire of Solomon," he observes, "was in the main a <span class="accented">congeries</span> of small kingdoms" - "had been superseded by governors." But it seems as natural to understand the term of the twelve prefects mentioned in chap. 4, who were "the governors of the land," or of similar officers in the different outposts of the kingdom. We know that the contributions which passed through their hands were furnished <span class="accented">in kind</span>; hence, perhaps, it is that this income is distinguished from the gold of ver. 14.

Rawlinson infers from the <span class="accented">weight</span> that the shields were only plated (shields were commonly made of wood, covered with leather). But whether they were solid or not does not decide the question whether the gold was pure or alloyed. "Shields of gold" are mentioned <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>; 1 Macc. 6:39]: six hundred shekels [Heb. omits <span class="accented">shekels</span>, as elsewhere, <a href="../../par/genesis/24-22.htm">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, etc. There were apparently two kinds of shekel, the Mosaic and the royal (for the latter see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>). The former was twice as much as the latter, but there is no agreement amongst commentators as to the weight or value of either. Nor can we be certain which is indicated here. Thenius decides for the former, and estimates the weight of the gold on each target to be 17 &frac12; lbs., and the value to be 6000 thalers (&pound;900), or, according to Keil, 5000 thalers (&pound;750). Keil, however, inclines to the belief that the royal shekel is meant, in which case the weight would be 9 lbs., and the value about &pound;400. Bahr, however, estimates the gold at no more than &pound;78 (523 thalers)] of gold went to one target.

In Rome the temple of Bellona was studded with them. In Athens, the round marks where they hung can still be traced on the walls of the Parthenon. There were also arms hung round the wails of the second temple (Jos., Ant. 15:11.3)," Stanley. It is supposed that along with those made by Solomon were hung the shields taken by David from the Syrians, as according to <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>, LXX., these latter also were carried off by Shishak. It has been inferred from <a href="../../par/songs/4-4.htm">Song of Solomon 4:4</a> that these also were 500 in number, and that the entire thousand were suspended on a part of the house of the forest of Lebanon known as the Tower of David; cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/47-9.htm">Psalm 47:9</a>]. The historian now proceeds to describe the great feature of another of Solomon's palaces. As the house of the forest of Lebanon was distinguished by the golden shields which emblazoned and glorified its walls, so was "the porch of judgment" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/7-7.htm">1 Kings 7:7</a>) by the chryselephantine throne.

Most commentators assume that there were fourteen, and the text will certainly bear that construction. But it is altogether more likely that there were twelve; that is to say, that the two lions on the topmost step are the two mentioned in the preceding verse as "standing beside the stays," otherwise there would have been four lions on that step. And we all know that <span class="accented">twelve</span> had a significance such as could not attach to any other number (Bahr, Symbolik, 1:201-205; 2:133, 423). It would signify that all the tribes had an interest in the royal house (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>); and a right of approach to the throne (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-31.htm">1 Kings 18:31</a>). The lion, a familiar emblem of sovereignty among many nations, had an especial appropriateness in this case, as being the symbol of the tribe of Judah (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>). We are to see in them partly "symbols of the ruler's authority" (Keil), and partly, perhaps, they represented the twelve tribes as guardians of the throne. "The king mounted between figures of lions to his seat on the throne, and sat between figures of lions upon it" (Wordsworth). Thrones somewhat similar to this in character, but much less magnificent, are represented on the Assyrian monuments.

This immense quantity of gold is quite paralleled in the accounts of profane writers. "Sardanapalus, when Nineveh was besieged, had 150 golden bedsteads, 150 golden tables, a million talents of gold, ten times as much silver, etc. (Ctesias, ap. Athenaeus, 12. p. 29).

Keil and Bahr contend that there was Out one fleet, first, because there is no mention of a second fleet at <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-28.htm">1 Kings 9:28</a>, and, secondly, because the cargoes were practically the same. I incline (with Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>.) to think there were two separate navies, for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The expression "navy of Tarshish" (in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/9-21.htm">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> expanded into "ships <span class="accented">going to</span> Tarshish," which Keil and Bahr are compelled to set aside as a mistake on the part of the writer), taken in connexion with the following words, "with (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">together with, as well as</span>) the navy of Hiram" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as we conclude from ver. 11, the navy <span class="accented">manned</span>, or, it may be, <span class="accented">owned</span>, by Hiram) points to a separate fleet; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the cargoes, so far from being the same, strike me as being altogether diverse. The Ophir fleet brought in "gold, almug trees, and precious stones." The navy of Tarshish "gold and silver ivory, apes, and peacocks." See below. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Even if we understand here by the "navy of Hiram" a Phoenician fleet, still a second fleet is indicated. But this leads us to consider the destination of these ships. The term, "fleet of Tarshish," does not in itself prove anything, for the expression, "ships of Tarshish," is almost a synonym for "merchant vessels." In <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a> we read, "Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish <span class="accented">to go to Ophir</span>," and they "were broken at Ezion-geber" (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>). It is probable that in Jewish lips the words were a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for all vessels going long voyages  (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-16.htm">Isaiah 2:16</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>; compare our "East Indiaman," "Greenlander"). But the words "in the sea," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, are most naturally understood of that ocean which the Jews called <span class="accented">par excellence</span> "the sea," or "the great sea" (<a href="../../par/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6, 7</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the Mediterranean, though the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> is undoubtedly used of the Red Sea, the Sea of Galilee, and the Dead Sea. And the more so as we know that the Tyrians had an extensive commerce with Tartessus, which was a great emporium of trade from the earliest times. Bahr objects that "no gold is found in Spain, but few peacocks, and little ivory;" but Rawlinson, on the other hand, affirms that "Spain had the richest silver mines known in the ancient world, and had a good deal of gold also" (Plin., Nat. Hist. 3:4), while "apes and ivory were produced by the opposite coast of Africa" (Herod. 4:191. As to peacocks see below). And it is a powerful argument in favour of Tartessus that it is the plentifulness of <span class="accented">silver</span> in Solomon's days has suggested this reference to the fleet. For though silver "was found in the land of the Nabataeans, according to Strabo, 16:784" (Keil), yet it was to Tartessus that the ancient world was chiefly indebted for its supplies of that metal. On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that second fleet, trading with the Mediterranean seaports, is here described. And <a href="../../par/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10</a> is distinctly in favour of this conclusion. When Ewald says ("Hist. Israel," 3:263) that the Phoenicians would hardly tolerate a rival in the Mediterranean, he surely forgets that they had been admitted by the Jews to share the trade of Ophir] <span class="cmt_word">with the navy of Hiram; once in three years</span> [This period agrees better with a voyage to Spain than to Southern Arabia. And if we understand it of Spanish voyages, it removes one difficulty in the way of placing Ophir in Arabia. It has also been urged that "the Hebrews reckoned parts of years and days as whole ones" (Kitte); but this hardly would apply to the expression "once in three years"] <span class="cmt_word">came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold and silver ivory</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">tooth of elephants</span>, LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. It is noteworthy that the name for elephant used here is derived from the Sanskrit (Gesen.), and an argument has been drawn hence in favour of placing Ophir in India, and of identifying the Tarshish fleet with the navy of Ophir. But such conclusions are extremely precarious. The name may have first come to the Jews from India, in which case it would be retained, from whatever quarter the commodity was subsequently derived. See Rawlinson, p. 546], and apes [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span>is in like manner identified by Gesenius, <span class="accented">al</span>., with the Sanskrit <span class="accented">kapi</span>. Sir J. Emerson Tennant ("Ceylon," 2 p 102) says "the terms by which these articles (ivory, apes, and peacocks) are designated in the Hebrew Scriptures are identical with the Tamil names by which some of them are called in Ceylon to the present day"], <span class="cmt_word">and peacocks.</span> [So the the ancients interpret the original word, though some of the moderns would understand "parrots."

Whether it was also found in Africa is uncertain. Aristophanes (Birds, 485) says, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Wordsworth very justly sees in the mention of these curious beasts and birds a symptom of declension in simplicity and piety, a token that "wealth had brought with it luxury and effeminacy, and a frivolous, vainglorious love for novel and outlandish objects.'

It may perhaps be said that this force was necessary to keep the tributary kings in due subjection. But it seems quite as likely that it was maintained largely for the sake of pomp and display.

It was esteemed both for its fruit and its wood, so much so that David appointed a steward to have the supervision both of "the olive trees and the sycamore trees in the Shefelah" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>). The sycamores of Egypt, which were used for the coffins of mummies (Dict.

Conder ("Tent-work," p. 5) describes it as "consisting of low hills, about five hundred feet above the sea, of white soft limestone," and adds that "the broad valleys among these hills...  produce fine crops of corn, and on the hills the long olive groves flourish better than in other districts" - an incidental and valuable confirmation of the text.

"And the <span class="accented">company</span> of kings' merchants took the <span class="accented">company</span> (of horses) at a price." The great difficulty in the way of this interpretation is perhaps the paronomasia, which, though not altogether without precedent, would be formal and unusual in grave history. Somewhat similarly Bahr: "and as to horses... and their collection, the merchants of the king made a collection for a certain price," but this again is strained and artificial. Perhaps it is safer to see in the word the name of a place. The LXX. (similarly the Vulgate) renders, "from Egypt <span class="accented">and from Thekoa</span>," <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, which Keil, however, contends is manifestly a variation of an older reading, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span>, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">from</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>." As to Koa or Kova, it is objected that no such place is mentioned elsewhere, and it is alleged that if it were a market for horses, or even if it were a frontier station, where the duties on horses were collected, we should surely have heard of it again. But this is by no means certain. Koa may well have been an in. significant post on the frontier which it was only necessary to mention in this connexion. <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x1f72;</span> certainly looks like an emendation, but it is to be remembered that although Tekoa (<a href="../../par/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-6.htm">2 Chronicles 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) was apparently an insignificant village, still it gave its name to a district; it was no great distance from the Egyptian frontier - it was some six Roman miles south of Bethlehem, according to Jerome (<span class="accented">in Amos</span>, Proem.), and it may have been the rendezvous of the Egyptian and Hebrew horse dealers.

It is hardly correct, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, to say (as Rawlinson) that the numbers are given in <a href="../../par/songs/6-8.htm">Song of Solomon 6:8</a> as "threescore queens and fourscore concubines," for it is obvious that too much importance must not be attached to an <span class="accented">obiter</span> statement ("there are threescore," etc.) in a poetical book, too, and one descriptive of Solomon's youth. The view of Ewald and Keil, again, that these numbers represent the sum total of the inmates of the harem at different periods of Solomon's long reign, rather than the number present at any one time - they would see in the numbers of Song of Solomon <span class="accented">l.c</span>. a statement of the <span class="accented">average strength</span> of the seraglio - though not to be described as evasive, is certainly not the natural interpretation of the words. And these numbers, when we compare them with the establishments of other Eastern potentates, are not found to be at all incredible. The commentators all remind us that Dareius Codomannus, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, took with him on his expedition against Alexander 360 <span class="accented">pellices</span>. Or if ancient history, as Rawlinson affirms, furnishes no strict parallel to these figures, the harems of modern Persia and Turkey at any rate have quite equalled that of Solomon. (See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc</span>.) It is true that Rehoboam had only 18 wives and 60 concubines (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>), but then Rehoboam was not Solomon.

I say <span class="accented">leanings</span>, for it is doubtful to what extent Solomon himself took part in actual idolatry. Both Bahr and Keil - the latter in opposition to the views he held in 1846 - not to speak of others, deny that he shared the idolatries of his wives, and the former labours hard, and on the whole, it seems to me, successfully, to prove that he was only guilty of <span class="accented">sanctioning</span> idolatrous worship in the vicinity of Jerusalem. His arguments, briefly stated, are these: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It is nowhere said that he "served" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) other gods - the expression constantly used of the idolatrous kings; cf. 16:31; 22:53; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>, etc. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Neither the son of Sirach nor the Talmud nor the Rabbins know anything of his personal idolatry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had he formally worshipped idols, his sin would have been greater than that of Jeroboam as to which, however, see on 1 Kings 12:29 sqq. (The "sin of Jeroboam" lay in "making Israel to sin," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in forcing his people into schismatic and unauthorized worship, rather than in any practices of his own.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The expressions "his heart was <span class="accented">not perfect</span>," below, and "he <span class="accented">went not fully"</span> (ver. 6) are inconsistent with the idea of idolatry. Similarly Ewald says, "There is no evidence from ancient authorities that Solomon, even in advanced life, ever left the religion of Jahveh, and with his own hand sacrificed to heathen gods. All traces of contemporary history extant testify to the contrary" (vol. 3. p. 297). See, however, on ver. 5]: <span class="cmt_word">and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God</span> [It is instructive to compare with this the words of <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-61.htm">1 Kings 8:61</a>, "Let your heart be perfect," etc. Wordsworth remarks that "the defection even of Solomon from God through the influence of his strange wives is one of the best justifications" of the commands of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2-4</a>, etc.], <span class="cmt_word">as was the heart of David his father.</span>

He cites <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; but it should be considered that in the two passages last cited the words are added, "and <span class="accented">served</span> them." And the true explanation would seem to be that, though "it is not stated that Solomon himself offered sacrifice to these idols," yet  "even the building of altars for idols was a participation in idolatry, which was irreconcilable with true fidelity to the Lord" (Keil). Bahr contends that the words "went after Ashtoreth," etc., no more involve personal service than the word "built" in ver. 7 involves personal labour; but both expressions show that he regarded these idolatries not only without disfavour, but with positive approval and practical encouragement. "It is not likely he could be so insensate as to adore such deities, but so far was the uxorious king blinded with affection, that he gave not passage only to the idolatry of his heathenish wives, but furtherance" (Bp. Hall). And the distinction, so far as the sin is concerned, between this and actual idolatry is a fine one. It is not implied, however, that Solomon ever discarded the worship of Jehovah. To the end of his reign he would seem to have offered his solemn sacrifices on the great altar thrice a year. But his heart was elsewhere (ver. 9).] <span class="cmt_word">Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> , <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, probably connected with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">stella</span>, and <span class="accented">star</span>, by some identified with the planet Venus, by others with the moon, is here mentioned for the first time in the singular (<span class="accented">Ashtaroth</span>, plural, is found in <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7-4.htm">1 Samuel 7:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-10.htm">1 Samuel 12:10</a>, etc.) With Baal, she divided the worship of the Phoenicians, the antiquity of which is evident from <a href="../../par/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/22-41.htm">Numbers 22:41</a>.

It must not be supposed that the following records stand in due chronological order.

It was only in his later life, however, that they materially affected his position and rule; hence it is that they are brought before us at this stage of the history, and also because they are manifestly regarded as chastisements for Solomon's sin.

We may perhaps regard the promise as fulfilled in the subsequent history of the kings of Judah. Not only did the kingdom last for nearly 500 years, but the royal house of David maintained its position to the time of Zerubbabel.

It is implied distinctly that it was because of Ahijah's prophecy. That prophecy, however, was in no sense a justification of treason or attack on Jeroboam's part. The fact that God had revealed His purposes was no reason why Jeroboam should forestall them. David knew and others knew that he was destined to be king, but he piously left it for God, in His own time and way, to place him on the throne. And Jeroboam's rebellion is the more inexcusable, because  Ahijah had expressly stated that Solomon was to retain the kingdom during his lifetime. However "he lifted up his hand;" there was some overt act of rebellion, and Solomon, because of this, and not because of the prophecy (of which, indeed, he may never have heard), sought to slay him.

The name possibly indicates Solomon's ambitious hopes respecting him. The irony of history alone emphasizes it. <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18, 19</a> would seem to show that Solomon himself had misgivings as to his son's abilities. "As the greatest persons cannot give themselves children, so the wisest cannot give their children wisdom" (Hall). His mother was Naamah, an Ammonitess (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-31.htm">1 Kings 14:31</a>). It would appear from <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>, and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-13.htm">2 Chronicles 12:13</a>, that he was 41 years of age at his accession.

To these reasons Rawlinson adds a fifth, viz. "that it is hardly likely that David would have permitted his son to marry an Ammonitess, which of course he must have done, if Rehoboam was born in his lifetime. But it should be remembered that David had himself married a foreign princess, Maachah, daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-2.htm">1 Chronicles 3:2</a>). There is greater force in the remark that Solomon's marriages with Ammonite and Moabite women belong apparently to a later period of his life (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>). Altogether the evidence seems to point to a corruption of the text of <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>, etc., and it has been suggested that "forty-one" is there an error of transcription for "twenty-one," a mistake easily made, if, as is extremely probable, the ancient Hebrews, like the later, used the letters of the alphabet as numerals. Twenty-one would then be <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>; forty-one <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">went to</span> [This journey was probably made soon after a prior coronation at Jerusalem. According to the LXX. addition, it was at least a year after his accession] <span class="cmt_word">Shechem</span> [An old gathering place of the northern tribes (<a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>). Its position, in the very centre of Palestine, fitted it for this purpose. ("Shechem may be considered the natural capital of Palestine," Conder, p. 16.) But it was perhaps primarily selected because it was the capital of Ephraim, not because it was a "national sanctuary of Israel" (Wordsworth), a title to which it has but little claim. It had once before furnished Ephraim with a king (<a href="../../par/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>). We learn from <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a> that it was "in Mount Ephraim;" from <a href="../../par/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a> that it was under Mount Gerizim. To its position the place was, no doubt, indebted for its name. It is often said to be doubtful whether the place was named after Shechem, the son of Hamor (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>), or whether this prince took his name from the place. The latter is, no doubt, the correct view. For <span class="accented">Shechem</span> means strictly, not, as it is often translated, the "shoulder," but <span class="accented">dorsi pars superior</span>, or perhaps the space between the shoulder blades (as is proved by <a href="../../par/job/31-22.htm">Job 31:22</a>, "Let my shoulder fall," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). Hence the word is found only in the singular (see Gesen., Thessalonians 3. p. 1407). Now any one who has seen the vale of Shechem (Nablus) will hardly doubt that its name is due to its resemblance to this part of the body (compare "Ezion-geber," <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>). The town lies in a valley between the two ridges of Ebal and Gerizim; cf. Jos., Ant. 4:08. 44. "The feet of these mountains where they rise from the town [to the height of 1000 feet] are not more than 500 yards apart." It is consequently one of the most striking and beautiful spots in Palestine, and the more so as its perennial supply of water clothes it with perpetual verdure. For its history see <a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/34.htm">Genesis 34</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/48-22.htm">Genesis 48:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-20.htm">Joshua 21:20</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-1.htm">Joshua 24:1, 25, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>; etc. In the New Testament it has been supposed to appear under the form <span class="accented">Sychar</span> (<a href="../../par/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), and this variation has been universally accounted for as a <span class="accented">paronomasia</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> meaning "a lie." But the recent survey has given us good reasons for identifying the place last named with 'Askar, a little village on the slope of Ebal, half a mile from Jacob's well and a little over a mile from Nablus (Condor, pp. 40, 41) ]: for [This word suggests that Rehoboam  had not "<span class="accented">selected</span> the capital of Ephraim to be the scene" of his coronation (Rawl.) but that he went thither <span class="accented">because</span> the northern tribes claimed this concession.

The name of Israel was already identified with the ten, or rather eleven, tribes (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/2-9.htm">2 Samuel 2:9, 10, 17, 28</a>). It is highly probable that the comparative isolation of Judah from the rest of the tribes (see Dict. Bib. vol. 1. p. 1157) had led to this result. Indeed, this fact - that the term "Israel" was used of the whole nation, <span class="accented">exclusive</span> of the tribe of Judah - shows in a very significant way the alienation of Judah from the rest] <span class="cmt_word">were come to Shoehorn to make him king</span>. [It would certainly seem from these words as if the ten tribes had then no settled idea of revolting.

But the glories of Solomon's reign and the traditions of the house of David would surely make <span class="accented">them</span> hesitate, even if they had heard of the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-29.htm">1 Kings 11:29</a>), before they wantonly broke away from Rehoboam.

No doubt, as the context shows, they intended to stipulate for an alleviation of burdens, etc., and their selection of Shechem as the place where they would render their allegiance was a "significant hint" (Ewald. "The very place puts Israel in mind of a rebellion," Bp. Hall) to Rehoboam. Their putting forward Jeroboam as their spokesman -presuming for the present that the received text of ver. 3 is to be retained, as to which, however, see below - was a further hint, or rather a plain indication, that they did not mean to be trifled with. It is not a proof, however, as Keil maintains, that they had already determined to make the latter king, for they distinctly said to Rehoboam (ver. 4), "Grant our petition <span class="accented">and we will serve thee</span>." (Ewald, who says "they had the fullest intentions of confirming his power as king if their wishes were granted," points out how this fact makes against the received text, according to which they had already summoned Jeroboam from Egypt.) It is clear from this and the passages cited above that the Jewish people at this period of their history were accustomed, not indeed to choose their king, but to confirm him in his office by public acclamation.]

It is true it involves but a slight change, and it may simplify the construction. But no change is really required, Bahr's objection, that in the text, as it stands, we have an unmeaning repetition, "He was still in Egypt...  and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt," loses all its force if we understand Jeroboam to have continued his residence in Egypt (as the LXX. says he did) after hearing of Solomon's death. until summoned by the tribes to be their leader. In any case the repetition accords with Hebrew usage.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-3.htm">1 Kings 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">That they sent and called him.

Vat. has simply,  "<span class="accented">And the people</span> spake unto king Rehoboam, saying." Of more importance, however, is the fact that it is at direct variance with ver. 20, which places the appearance of Jeroboam on the scene <span class="accented">after</span> the revolt of the tribes. Indeed, these two verses can only be brought into agreement by the questionable device of understanding the "all Israel" of ver. 20 very differently from the same expression in ver. 1. If, however, we follow in this instance the LXX., which omits the name of Jeroboam both here and in ver. 12 (and which thereby implies that he was not one of the deputation to Rehoboam, but, as ver. 2 states, was at that time still in Egypt), the difficulty vanishes. Ver. 20 then becomes the natural and logical continuation of vers. 2, 3. "And Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt. And they sent and called him [to the country.]...  And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again [at their summons] they sent and called him unto the congregation," etc. And in favour of the omission of Jeroboam's name is the fact that the Hebrew text, both in ver. 3 and in ver. 12, betrays some little confusion. In ver. 3, the <span class="accented">Cethib</span> has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> in ver. 12, whereas the <span class="accented">Keri</span> has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;</span> in both cases.

Was this complaint a just one? It is one which occasions us some surprise, as the reign of Solomon had not only been glorious, but the people had apparently enjoyed the greatest plenty and prosperity (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20, 25</a>; cf. 8:66). Bishop Hall, Bahr, and other writers, consequently, who see in the fact that the ten tribes had chosen Jeroboam for their mouthpiece a settled determination on their part to revolt, affirm that their grievances were purely factitious. But we must not forget that, despite the unbroken peace (see Hall, "Contempl." 2:136) and general prosperity and affluence, the people had had one burden at least to bear which is always galling and vexatious, the burden of a conscription. It is by no means certain, though it is constantly assumed, and is not in itself improbable, that the taxes and imposts had been heavy, the passages alleged in support of that view (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-15.htm">1 Kings 10:15, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>, LXX.) being quite inconclusive. But while we have no right to speak of the, enormous exactions of the late king" (Stanley), we may be perfectly sure that such an establishment as his (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-22.htm">1 Kings 4:22, 26</a>) and such undertakings (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/7.htm">1 Kings 7</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26, 17, 18</a>) would be extremely costly, and that their cost was not altogether defrayed by the presents of subject princes (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; cf. 10:10, 14), the profits of the king's merchants (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-28.htm">1 Kings 10:28</a>), or the imports of the fleet (1 Kings 5:21 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:7<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>). But the people had certainly had to pay a more odious tribute, that of forced labour, of servile work (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>, Hebr.; 5:14 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 4:34<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> is almost always used of a tribute rendered by labour, Gesen.) It is quite true that Solomon was not the first to institute this; that David had exacted it before him (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>); that the burden was one with which all subjects of the old-world monarchies, especially in the East, were familiar; and that in this case it had been imposed with peculiar considerateness (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>). But it is none the less certain, when we consider the magnitude of Solomon's undertakings, and the number of men necessarily employed in executing them, that it must have involved some hardships and created much dissatisfaction; such results are inevitable in all conscriptions. "Forced labour has been amongst the causes leading to insurrection in many ages and countries. It alienated the people of Rome from the last Tarquin; it helped to bring about the French Revolution; and it was for many years one of the principal grievances of the Russian serfs" (Rawlinson). But we may find instances of its working perhaps as more Eastern, more closely illustrative of the text amongst the Fellahin of Egypt. "According to Pliny, 360,000 men had to work 20 years long at one pyramid" (Bahr). In the construction of the great Mahmoudieh canal, by Mehemet All, over 300,000 labourers were employed. They worked under the lash, and such were the fatigues and hardships of their life that many thousands died in the space of a few months (cf., too, <a href="../../par/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11</a> sqq.; Exodus 2:23]: <span class="cmt_word">now therefore make thou the grievous</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">hard, heavy</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter</span> [lit., "<span class="accented">lighten somewhat from</span>," etc.], <span class="cmt_word">and we will serve thee.</span> [Their stipulations seem reasonable enough. Bahr, who says, "We cannot admit the complaint of too hard tribute work to be well founded," and Keil, who maintains that "there cannot have been any well-grounded occasion for complaint," surely forget that both the aged counsellors (ver. 7) and also the writer of this book (vers. 13-15) manifest some degree of sympathy with the complainants.]

For "Adoram," the LXX. and other versions read "Adoniram" here. It is curious that a person of the same name, Adoram (LXX. Adoniram), was over David's levy (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-24.htm">2 Samuel 20:24</a>). That there was a relationship, and that the office had descended from father to son, can hardly be doubted, but whether two persons or three are indicated it is impossible to say. It is of course just possible, though hardly likely that one and the same person (Ewald) can  have been superintendent of servile work under David, Solomon, and Rehoboam. It is generally assumed that the young king sent this officer "to treat with the rebels and to appease them, as Josephus expressly says" (Bahr). It seems quite as likely that he was sent to coerce them, or to collect the taxes, as a summary way of showing that the king meant to enforce his rights and was not moved by their words. For it is hardly probable that such a proud and headstrong prince as Rehoboam would stoop, especially after the confident threats which he had just uttered, to parley with rebels. Such a man, guided by such counsellors, and inflated with a sense of his own power and importance, would naturally think of force rather than of conciliation or concessions. He would be for trying his whips of scorpions. And if conciliation had been his object, it is hardly likely that he would have employed Adoram, the superintendent of the levy, a man who would naturally be obnoxious to the people, to effect it. Moreover the sequel - Adoram's tragical end - also favours the supposition that he was sent, not "to arrange some alleviation of their burdens" (Rawlinson), but to carry out the high-handed policy Of the king]; <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel stoned him with stones</span> ["With one exception, this was a bloodless revolution" (Stanley).

Bahr, Keil, and others, who start from the assumption that secession was determined upon even before Rehoboam came to Shechem, and that the complaints of the people respecting the grievous service to which they had been subjected by Solomon were groundless, naturally conclude that it was altogether treasonable and unjustifiable. But is this conclusion borne out by the facts? We may readily admit that the schism was not accomplished without sin: we cannot but allow that Israel acted with undue precipitation, and that Rehoboam, who was "young and tenderhearted," was entitled, for David's and Solomon's sake, as well as his own, to greater forbearance and consideration, and it is almost certain that both the "envy of Ephraim" and the ambition of Jeroboam largely influenced the result. At the same time, it is to be remembered that the division of the kingdom was ordained of God, and that the people had just cause of complaint, if not, indeed, sufficient warrant for resistance, in the arbitrary and insolent rejection of their petition by the young king. No law of God requires men to yield themselves up without a struggle to such cruel and abject slavery as Rehoboam threatened these men with. They judged - and who shall say unreasonably? - from his words that they had only tyranny and cruelty to expect at his hands, and what wonder if they stood on their defence? They are only to be blamed because they did more.

That a sort of jealousy existed at one time between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, consequent, no doubt, on the transference of the sceptre from the house of Saul to that of David, <span class="cmt_word">is</span> very evident. A thousand men of Benjamin constituted the following of the rebel Shimei, (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). The rising of Sheba the Benjamite, again (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>), proves that the enmity and discontent were not even then subdued. But when the ten tribes fell away, Benjamin seems never to have faltered in its allegiance. The change is easily accounted for. It was the glory of Benjamin that Jerusalem, the joy of the whole earth, the civil and religious capital of the nation, was largely within its border. "The city of the Jebusite" was in the lot of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). But it was also on the boundary line of Judah. This fact had, no doubt, brought the two tribes into close contact, and had given them interests in common, in fact had "riveted them together as by a cramp" (Blunt, pp. 167, 174, who traces "a gradual tendency of the ten tribes to become confederate under Ephraim," and a growing alliance and community of interests between Judah and Benjamin); and now Benjamin could not fail to see that separation from Judah would mean the loss of Jerusalem (which would be largely peopled by the men of Judah, David's tribe, and would be practically in their hands), while adhesion to Ephraim would not prevent the establishment of another sanctuary further north. The traditions of fifty years, consequently, and the common interest in the capital, prevailed over hereditary ties and ancient feuds, and decided Benjamin to cast in its lot with Judah;the more so, as the heads of this tribe may have felt, after once furnishing Israel with its king, as jealous of Ephraim as they had once been of Judah.

LXX. inserts along addition, which differs from, and indeed contradicts, the Hebrew text in some important particulars. Rehoboam is represented as 16 years of age (Hebrews 40), as reigning 12 years (Hebrews 17); his mother is Naanan (Heb. Naamah), and is the daughter of Ana, son of Nahash, king of Ammon. Jeroboam is described as son of Sarira, a harlot. He is appointed by Solomon superintendent of the levy of Ephraim, and builds for him a city Sarira, and also completes the circumvallation of Jerusalem. He has 300 chariots and aims at royalty. Solomon seeking to slay him, he flees to Shishak, king of Egypt, who treats him with distinction, giving him the sister of his own wife in marriage. Here his son Abijah is born, when Rehoboam has been, something like a year upon the throne. After his birth, Jeroboam asks a second time to be released: he returns to his own country, takes up his abode at Sarira, fortifies it, and gathers the tribe of Ephraim round him. Here Abijah falls sick, and the visit to the prophet, narrated in chap. 14, takes place. The child dies; there is general mourning, after which Jeroboam goes to Shechem, and collects the tribes. Here the prophet Shemaiah (not Ahijah) tears a new garment in twelve pieces, gives him ten, and promises him the dominion over ten tribes. After which follow the events of vers. 5-24 of this chapter. The great circumstantiality of this narrative has led some scholars - Dean Stanley among them - to prefer it before the Hebrew version. But its details will not bear careful examination, and there is little doubt that it is a compilation of later date. Its untrustworthiness has been well shown among others by Rawlinson, Speaker's Commentary <span class="accented">in loc</span>. But he omits to notice what is perhaps its strongest condemnation, viz., that this LXX. addition is in conflict with the LXX. (and Hebrews) text of chap. 11. The account of Jeroboam's marriage with the sister of the queen, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., is manifestly a variation of the history of Hadad (ch. 11. ver. 19; see also ver. 22).

"The tower of Sichem had been burnt down by Abimelech and the tower of Penuel had been destroyed by Gideon, <a href="../../par/judges/8-17.htm">Judges 8:17</a>" (Keil). The <span class="accented">city</span> of Shechem had been destroyed at the same time as the tower, but had no doubt been rebuilt, at least in part, otherwise it could hardly have been selected for Rehoboam's coronation. It was naturally Jeroboam's first care to strengthen his position by fortitying his capital, and the more so as this city would be particularly obnoxious to Rehoboam as the scene of the revolution; but why he should at the same time have rebuilt Penuel - Ewald thinks the seat of government was placed here - is not at first eight so obvious, as it lay beyond the Jordan (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22, 30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17</a>) and was therefore presumably outside the circle of hostilities, should such arise. Probably it was because this was the gate to his Trans-Jordanic territory. A tower commanding the fords of the Jordan would secure Reuben, Gad, etc., against invasion from Judah. It is also not unlikely that Jeroboam. who was the great castle builder of that age, had some fears of "hostile attacks from the north and northeast" (Keil), or thought of "the caravan road which led over Gilead to Damascus" (Wordsworth), and of which he would wish, for the sake of his revenue, to retain the control], <span class="cmt_word">and dwelt therein</span> [He made it his first residence and capital]; <span class="cmt_word">and went out from thence</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, when he had secured one fortified city.

But is this quite so certain? The people after the revolt would naturally conclude that Rehoboam, of whose proud temper they had had such proof, would want to wreak his vengeance on the city which had rejected him, and the instinct of self-defence would lead them at once to rebuild their walls. And the newborn kingdom would also earnestly desire to possess a suitable capital. Thus their self-interest and enthusiasm alike would obviate the necessity for a conscription.]

Bahr understands, "he reflected about it alone" (<span class="accented">et excogitato consilio</span>, Vulgate), alleging that so important a circumstance as the concurrence of the heads of the people in changing the system of worship would not have been passed over in silence. But while the text does not perhaps imply any formal deliberation with the elders, it is reasonable to suppose that Jeroboam, who owed his position to popular election, and who was far too sagacious not to follow the example of Rehoboam (vers. 6, 9), would summon others to advise him as to this critical and momentous step. Wordsworth refers to <a href="../../par/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1</a>, and says that "Jeroboam is the image and pattern of Machiavellian politicians." "Next to Ahithophel, I do not find that Israel yielded a craftier head than Jeroboam's" (Hall)], <span class="cmt_word">and made two calves</span> [It is generally held that these were in imitation of, or were suggested by, the "golden calf" of Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-2.htm">Exodus 32:2</a>), and the close resemblance of Jeroboam's words (below), in inaugurating this new <span class="accented">cultus</span>, to Aaron's have been thought to prove it. But surely it has been overlooked that Jeroboam could hardly be so shortsighted and unwise as deliberately to reintroduce a worship which had provoked the "fierce wrath" (ver. 12) of God, and had nearly resulted in the extermination of the Jewish race. For of course neither Jeroboam nor his people could have forgotten the stern condemnation which Aaron's calf worship had received. The molten image ground to powder, the ashes mixed in the drink of the people, the slaughter of three thousand worshippers, etc., would assuredly have lived in the memories of the nation. A more impolitic step, consequently - one more certain to precipitate his ruin, by driving the whole nation into the arms of Judah - Jeroboam could not have taken, than to attempt any revival or imitation of the forbidden cultus of the desert. And it is as little likely that the worship of the calves was derived from the worship of Apis, as practised at Memphis, or of "Mnevis, the sacred calf of Heliopolis" (Stanley), though with both of these Jeroboam had recently been in contact. It would have been but a sorry recommendation in the eyes of Israel that the first act of the new king should be to introduce the hateful idolatry of Egypt into the land; and every consideration tends to show that the calf worship was not, and was not intended to be, idolatry, such as the worship of Egypt undoubtedly was. It is always carefully distinguished from idol worship by the historians and prophets. And the idea which Jeroboam wished to give his subjects was clearly this that, so far from introducing new gods or new sanctuaries, he was merely accommodating the old worship to the new state of things. He evidently felt that what he and his house had most to fear was, not the armies of Rehoboam but the ritual and religious associations of Jerusalem. His object, if he were wise, must therefore be to provide a substitute, a counterfeit worship. "I will give you," he virtually says, "at Bethel and Dan, old sanctuaries of our race long before Jerusalem usurped their place, those visible emblems of the heavenly powers such as are now found only in the temple. You too shall possess those mysterious forms which symbolize the Invisible, but you shall have them nearer home and easier of access." There can be little doubt, consequently, that the "calves" were imitations of the colossal cherubim of Solomon's temple, in which the ox or calf was probably the <span class="accented">forma praecipua</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-23.htm">1 Kings 6:23</a>).] <span class="cmt_word">of gold</span> [Hardly of solid gold.

The word is translated, gods" in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1, 4, 8, 23, 31</a>; but as the reference is in every case to the one calf, it should be translated "god" there also.

"<span class="accented">This</span> is thy god," etc. The words are not "<span class="accented">exactly</span> the same as the people used when setting up the golden calf" (Bahr). Jeroboam says, "<span class="accented">Behold</span>," etc.], <span class="cmt_word">O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span> [It is at first sight somewhat difficult to resist the view, which is generally entertained, that Jeroboam, of set purpose, cited the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the Israelites in the desert (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4</a>). But a little reflection will show that it is much more difficult to believe that a monarch, circumstanced as Jeroboam was, could at the very outset of his career have acted in the teeth of history, and have committed the gross blunder, not to say wanton outrage, of deliberately connecting his new cult with the calf worship of the desert. He can hardly have dared, that is, to say, "This is no new religion, for this very form of worship our fathers used formerly in the desert, under the guidance of Aaron himself" (Seb. Schmidt, followed by Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>.) unless both he and his people alike - which is inconceivable - were ignorant of their nation's history recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19-35</a>. It has been argued by some that this action of Jeroboam and the ready compliance of the ten tribes, prove that the Pentateuch cannot then have been written. But, as Hengstenberg (cited by Wordsworth) rejoins, the same argument would lead to the conclusion that the Bible could not have been written in the dark ages, or, we might add, even at the present day. He can hardly have claimed, that is to say, to be reintroducing the calf worship, which God had so emphatically reprobated, unless he designed an open defiance of the Most High, and wished to shock all the religious instincts and convictions of his people. It is much more natural, consequently, to suppose, considering the very frequent recurrence, though sometimes in slightly different shapes, of the formula "the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-45.htm">Exodus 29:45, 46</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-38.htm">Leviticus 25:38</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13, 45</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/15-41.htm">Numbers 15:41</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-13.htm">Numbers 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/20-16.htm">Numbers 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-14.htm">Deuteronomy 8:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-6.htm">Joshua 24:6, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/6-8.htm">Judges 6:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-8.htm">1 Samuel 8:8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-18.htm">1 Samuel 10:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-21.htm">1 Kings 8:21</a>, etc.) that the correspondence is accidental, the more so as Jeroboam does not quote the exact words, and that he has used a phrase which was constantly in their ears, insisting thereby that his calves were emblems of the God of their race, the God whose great glory it was that He had taken their nation out of the midst of another nation, etc. (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>), and delivered them from a thraldom with which, perhaps, the tyranny of Rehoboam is indirectly compared.

First, both these places were in some sort sanctuaries already. Bethel was already a <span class="accented">makom</span>, or holy place, in the days of Abraham; was consecrated by the visions and altar of Jacob (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11-19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/31-13.htm">Genesis 31:13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-1.htm">Genesis 35:1, 7, 15</a>), and by the ark having been there (<a href="../../par/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-28</a>, Hebrews; cf.

A grandson of Moses (<a href="../../par/judges/18-13.htm">Judges 18:13</a>, true reading) had ministered there, and his sons were the priests of Dan still. Secondly, these localities would suit the convenience of his subjects, being respectively at the southern and northern extremities of the kingdom. And this, no doubt, was one reason why Dan was chosen in preference to other places, such as Shiloh, which, though more sacred,  were less conveniently situated. A sanctuary at Dan would save the northern tribes many tedious journeys. It should be remarked that Bethel properly belonged to Benjamin (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13, 22</a>), though it was also on the border of Ephraim; and it has been suggested that it was Jeroboam's selection of this place as a seat of the calf worship decided the tribe of Benjamin to follow the lead of Judah. But the narrative seems to imply that their choice had been made at an earlier period (ver. 21), and the city would seem to have been long in the possession of the house of Joseph (<a href="../../par/judges/1-22.htm">Judges 1:22</a>). It is now known as <span class="accented">Beitin</span>, and is one of the most naked and dreary spots in Palestine.

Some (Rawlinson, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>.) have suggested that the text is here corrupt, and that we should read, "before the one to Bethel, and before the other to Dan." According to others, "the one" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) refers to the double <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> ("the one," "the other"); cf. ver. 29. They would interpret, that is, "the people went to both, even to the distant Dan" (Bahr, Thenius). Keil would force the text and understand, "the people, even unto Dan," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the people throughout the whole kingdom. Similarly, Wordsworth. Ewald understands "before the one" to mean <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "<span class="accented">as one</span>," <span class="accented">sc</span>. man. On the whole it is better to take the words as they stand, literally. It is quite conceivable that, at first, the people resorted almost exclusively to the Danite sanctuary. Having been for long years a seat of worship, and having probably its "house of high places," or temple (see below), already built, it would naturally be in a position to receive worshippers some time before Bethel was prepared for that purpose. Jeroboam's offering in person at Bethel (ver. 32) which marks the inauguration of his new ritual there, may have been partly designed to attract worshippers to a shrine, which, as being nearer Jerusalem, or for some other reason, was neglected. But the verse is patient of another interpretation. It may intend to convey that the rebellious tribes, in their defiant disregard of the old order of things, the order now represented by a hostile kingdom, went <span class="accented">en masse</span> to the opposite point of the compass, even to the unhallowed and hitherto despised sanctuary of the Danites. The LXX. (Vat.) addition here is noticeable, "And they forsook the house of the Lord."] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a></div><div class="verse">And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made an house of high places</span> [See on 1 Kings 3:2, and cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29</a>. It is often assumed (Keil, Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al.</span> after Josephus) that Jeroboam built <span class="accented">two</span> temples for his cherubim, and the statement of the text, that he built one, is explained on the ground that the historian contrasts the "house of high places" with the "house of the Lord." Ewald, too, after <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-29.htm">2 Kings 17:29, 32</a>, understands the words as <span class="accented">plural</span>. But is it not more probable that a chapel or sanctuary already existed at Dan, where an irregular priesthood had ministered for more than four hundred years? This verse would then refer exclusively to Jeroboam's procedure at <span class="accented">Bethel</span> (see next verse). There he built a temple and ordained a number of priests, but Dan had both already. We know that the Danite priests carried on the calf worship to the time of the captivity (<a href="../../par/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30</a>).

The statement of ver. 14, that, "Jeroboam and his sons" had "cast them out," suggests that they had refused to take part in his new cult and that thereupon he banished them, and, no doubt, confiscated their possessions. The idea of Stanley, that "following the precedent of the deposition of Abiathar by Solomon, he removed from their places the whole of the sacerdotal order," is a wild conjecture for which Scripture affords not the slightest warrant.]

This was the great feast of the year, and, as the feast of harvest or ingathering, the most joyous. See on 1 Kings 8:1. Had Jeroboam provided no counter attraction to this great festive gathering in Judah he might have found it a formidable temptation to his subjects. The reason usually given for the alteration of the time - in defiance of the law, which expressly fixed it in the seventh month (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34, 39, 41</a>) - is that the eighth would be more generally convenient in the north, where the harvest or vintage was a month later (Then., Keil), as affording more time for the ingathering. In favour of this view is the consideration that the Jews not unfrequently had to intercalate a month - a second Adar - into their year, because of the season being a late one. Some of the older commentators, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., Vatab., think this time was chosen as the anniversary of his secession, but this is pure conjecture, and such an association would be contrary to the genius of the Hebrew people. Keil maintains that Jeroboam's design was to "make the separation, in a religious point of view, as complete as possible." But we can hardly be expected to believe that he altered the <span class="accented">month</span>, for the sake of creating a distinction, but "retained the <span class="accented">day</span> of the month, the fifteenth, for the sake of the weak who took offence at his innovations" (Keil).

It was probably approached by s slope, as <a href="../../par/exodus/20-26.htm">Exodus 20:26</a> forbade steps, though it is by no means certain that they were not used even in Solomon's temple, and Jeroboam probably would have no scruples on such a minute point of ritual. It has been thought (Kitto, 4:147) that he was moved to officiate in person by the precedent of the Egyptian kings, who exercised priestly functions; but it is much more probable that he was guided by the example of Solomon at the dedication of the temple] <span class="cmt_word">upon</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, he stood upon the ledge or platform (called in the A.V.

And not only does this slight change bring the Hebrew into harmony with the LXX., but it also simplifies the construction.

We may perhaps see in Jeroboam's ministering in person, not only the design to invest the new ordinance with exceptional interest and splendour, but also the idea of encouraging his new priests to enter on their unauthorized functions with. out fear. The history, or even the traditions, of Nadab and Abihu (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10</a>.) and of Korah and his company (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>), and the threatenings of the law (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-7.htm">Numbers 18:7, 22</a>, cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>), may well have made them hesitate.

Stanley says with truth that "the prophetical activity of the time...  is to be found in the kingdom, not of Judah, but of Israel," but omits to add that it was because the northern kingdom more especially needed their ministry.

It is as if the prophet disdained to notice the royal but self-constituted priest; as if it were useless to appeal to him; as if his person was of little consequence compared with the religious system he was inaugurating, the system of which the altar was the centre and embodiment]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name</span> [This particular mention of the Reformer by name was formerly regarded, as by many it is still, as a remarkable instance of prophetic foresight. But the tendency of late, even amongst orthodox theologians, has been to doubt the authenticity of these two words, on the ground that it is unlike Scripture prophecy in general to descend to such details, which rather belong to soothsaying than prediction. Prophecy concerns itself not with names, times, and similar particulars, but with the "progressive development of the kingdom of God in its general features" (Keil). It is not for a moment denied that the prophet could just as easily, speaking "in the word of the Lord," have mentioned the name of Josiah, as the circumstance that a son of the house of David would utterly destroy the worship of calves. But it is alleged that the latter prediction is quite in accordance with Scripture usage, and the former altogether contrarient thereto. The case of Cyrus (<a href="../../par/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-1.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>), it is true, is an exception to the rule, unless <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (which means <span class="accented">the sun</span>) is, like Pharaoh and Hadad, a name of office, a title of the Persian kings. The instances of Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-19.htm">Genesis 17:19</a>) and Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>) are not parallels, as in both these cases the name was highly significant, and each was mentioned, not by way of prophecy, but as a direction to bestow that name on a child shortly about to be born. And it is certainly noticeable - though the argument <span class="accented">e</span> <span class="accented">silentio is</span> necessarily a precarious one - "that where this narrative is again referred to (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-18</a>) there is no allusion to the fact that the man of God had prophesied of Josiah <span class="accented">by</span> <span class="accented">name"</span> (Rawlinson). On the whole, therefore, it seems probable that the two words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;</span> were no part of the original prophecy, but a marginal note which in course of time found its way accidentally into the text. The idea of Keil, that "Josiah" is mentioned here not as a proper name, but as an appellation, "he whom Jehovah sustains," is hardly worthy of serious consideration. It may be allowed, however, that the <span class="accented">meaning</span> of the name affords some slender reason for its mention]; <span class="cmt_word">and upon thee shall he offer</span> [lit., <span class="accented">sacrifice</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the priests of the high places</span> [see on 1 Kings 12:32] <span class="cmt_word">that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">bones of man, i.e.</span>, human bones. Nothing could more completely foreshadow the future desecration of the altar. The presence in the congregation of a living man who had merely touched a dead body and had not been purified, defiled the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>), how much more the dead body itself, burnt on the very altar. The Samaritan who once strewed the temple with human ashes (Jos., Ant. 18:02.2) knew that he took the most effectual way to pollute it] <span class="cmt_word">shall be burnt</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">shall they burn</span>] <span class="cmt_word">upon thee.</span> [For the fulfilment, see <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a>, "At the ground of this judgment, as of the whole theocratic law, lies the <span class="accented">jus</span> talionis" (Keil, 1846).] It is worthy of note how completely this brief protest proclaimed to Jeroboam the utter and shameful overthrow, both of his political and religious systems. A child of the rival house of David should stand where <span class="accented">he</span> then stood, his successors extinct or powerless to prevent him, and should cover this new cultus with disgrace and contempt. The man of God, he must have felt, has proclaimed in few words the fall of his dynasty, the triumph of his rival, and the failure of all his schemes.

"This is the proof that my message is from Him, and is no idle threat." Wordsworth sees in this sign "a proof vouchsafed by God Himself to the man of Judah, as well as to Jeroboam, that he was really sent by God," etc. But surely a man who came "in the word of the Lord," and cried, "Thus saith the Lord," wanted no proof that "he was doing God's bidding" (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>)]; <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the altar shall be rent and the ashes</span> [strictly, <span class="accented">fat ashes</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>; properly, "fatness" (see <a href="../../par/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/63-5.htm">Psalm 63:5</a>. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.), is the fat of the sacrifice, which was burnt upon the altar, mixed with the ashes that consumed it] <span class="cmt_word">that are upon it shall be poured out.</span> [The sign, a partial destruction of the altar, and the scattering of the sacrifice, was admirably calculated to presage its ultimate and final and ignominious overthrow.

The king doubtless may have hoped that it would "blunt the edge of the prophet's denunciation of his schismatical altar" (Wordsworth); but this was not the object, or not the sole object, with which the invitation was given. Jeroboam could not possibly have done less, after the signal service the man of God had rendered him, than invite him to his palace. Eastern courtesy alone (<a href="../../par/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/19-2.htm">Genesis 19:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/43-24.htm">Genesis 43:24</a>, etc.) would require him to offer hospitality to his benefactor. And he could scarcely hope that any hospitalities would either neutralize the impression which the recent miracles had made, or win over to his side one who had a direct commission from the Most High to oppose him.

Because of this provision, the old prophet (ver. 10) was reduced to ask, "What way went he?" But the charge, we can hardly doubt,was also designed to serve another purpose, viz., to warn the prophet against doing what he did presently - against returning to Bethel. When he was followed, and when he was told of a revelation commanding his return, he should have remembered, among other things, that it had clearly been part of God's purpose, as evidenced by the explicit instructions given him, that he should not be followed. This alone should have led him to suspect this old prophet of deceit.]

THE DISOBEDIENCE AND DEATH OF THE MAN OF GOD. - The seduction of the man of God, who has borne such fearless witness against Jeroboam's ecclesiastical policy, and his tragical end, are now narrated, partly because of the deep impression the story made at the time, but principally because these events were in themselves an eloquent testimony against the worship of the calves and the whole ecclesiastical policy of Jeroboam, and a solemn warning for all time against any, the slightest, departure from the commandments of God. The very unfaithfulness of this accredited messenger of the Most High, and the instant punishment it provoked, became part of the Divine protest against the new <span class="accented">regime</span>, against the unfaithfulness of Israel; whilst the remarkable manner in which these occurrences were recalled to the nation's memory in the reign of Josiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-17.htm">2 Kings 23:17, 18</a>) made it impossible for the historian of the theocracy to pass them over without notice.

For we cannot suppose that a sense of duty had kept this prophet at his post (see note on ver. 1). The fact that he remained, not only in the kingdom, but at its ecclesiastical capital; that he stood by without protest when the schism was being effected, and that, though not present himself at the sacrifice, he permitted his sons to be there, is a sufficient index to his character. It is quite possible that strong political sympathies had warped his judgment, and that he had persuaded himself that the policy of Jeroboam was necessitated by the division of the kingdom, which he knew to be from the Lord, and which one of his own order had foretold. Or it may be that, despite his better judgment, he had gone with his tribe and the majority of the nation, and now  felt it difficult to withdraw from a false position. Or, finally, he may have taken the side of Jeroboam because of the greater honours and rewards that prince had to bestow (see on ver. 18).

The true character and designs and motives of this "old prophet" have long been a <span class="accented">crux interpretum</span> (see Hall, Contempl., 2:151-3.) Some, including Josephus and most Jewish commentators, have supposed him to be altogether a false and lying prophet, such as are found plentifully later on in the history (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-1.htm">Jeremiah 28:1</a>); but against this is the fact that he was undoubtedly the channel of a Divine communication (ver. 21). The real difficulty, no doubt, lies in the fact that one by whom the Spirit of God spake to man should have acted so base a part as he did. But it must be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that he did not know what a terrible judgment his lie would bring upon "the man of God;" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that truth had not the place in the Jewish scheme which it has in Christian morals; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the gift of prophecy is compatible with much moral imperfection on the part of the prophet - the cases of Balaam and Caiaphas will occur to all - and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that this man was constrained to prophesy almost in spite of himself; he was compelled, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to proclaim his own falseness, and to announce the punishment of the man he had himself deceived. It is also to be considered that this lying prophet, like those of <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>, accomplished the purpose of God, which was to make the man of God a <span class="accented">sign</span> to the men of that generation. Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>. In this latter consideration, indeed, lies the key to the history, The <span class="accented">object</span> the old prophet had in view it is not so difficult to divine. He hears that the prophet of Judah has refused the hospitality of King Jeroboam, and has put the city of Bethel and the new cultus under a virtual ban by refusing to eat bread in the place, or to hold any communication with the inhabitants, himself among the rest, although he has taken no part, even by his presence, in the ceremonial of the day. He naturally feels himself condemned and aggrieved by this conduct. A <span class="accented">prophet</span> would feel the interdict much more keenly than the people, and there can be little doubt that this man, who had been trying to serve two masters, was deeply mortified by the excommunication pronounced against him. He resolves, therefore, to rehabilitate himself in his own estimation and that of his neighbours, by bringing back the man of God to eat and to drink, and so in effect to remove the interdict, at any cost. If he succeeds, he win make the whole city, and especially the sovereign, whose policy has been so emphatically condemned, his debtor; while by accomplishing what the <span class="accented">king</span> had failed to effect, he will at once heal his wounded pride and secure a position of influence in the new kingdom. If it was the hope of temporal advancement had detained him at Bethel, he now sees, as he thinks, an easy way to its attainment; if it was an ardent sympathy with the new state of things, he sees before him an opportunity of expressing it in a most practical and serviceable way.]

For not only is the term "prophet" throughout this narrative restricted to the prophet of Bethel (the prophet of Judah being always spoken of as "the man of God,") but the expression here used <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d4;</span> is also twice used (vers. 20, 26) of the same prophet. He is characterized there, that is to say, as "the prophet which brought him back;" it is hardly likely, therefore, that the same words are here to be interpreted, "the prophet whom he brought back." The mistake has arisen from the proximity of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> ("for him") to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> ("to" or "for the prophet"). But the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>is here indicative of possession (the dative of the possessor), as in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-16.htm">1 Samuel 14:16</a>, "the watchmen to," <span class="accented">i.e., of</span>, "Saul," and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, "a son to Jesse" (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18</a> Heb.; 1 Kings 5:29 <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:15<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Heb.; Ruth 2:3 Heb.) We must therefore render "He (the old prophet, but this is not absolutely certain; the "man of God" <span class="accented">may</span> be understood) saddled for him (the man of God) the ass of the prophet which brought him back." The man of God had been delayed by his return to Bethel, and the prophet, out of pity, lends or gives him his ass. Not merely, it is probable, for the sake of speeding him on his way, but that he might have some living thing with him on a journey which he had so much cause to dread.

[These particulars are mentioned to show that his death was no accident, or chance, but a visitation of God. There are probably but few persons who have not felt that this summary punishment was marked by extreme severity; the more so, as the prophet was cruelly deceived, and that by a brother prophet, who claimed to have received a subsequent revelation, and whom, consequently, it appeared to be a duty to obey. And when it is observed that the really guilty person, the prophet of Bethel, so far as appears, escaped all punishment, and by his lie secured for himself respect for his remains, we seem to have a case of positive hardship and injustice. As I have discussed the question at some length elsewhere (Homil. Quart., vol. 4. pp. 214-221), it must suffice to say here that the difficulty is at once removed if we remember that although the Jewish dispensation was one of temporal recompenses, yet all the same there is a judgment hereafter. No doubt the man of God was punished for his disobedience, for inexcusable disobedience it was. It is quite true that he was solemnly assured that an angel had appeared to revoke his commission, but for this he had only the word of a stranger, of one, too, with whom he had been commanded "not even to eat." He had "the word of the Lord;" that is to say, the voice of God, borne in upon his soul, forbidding his return, and the word of an irreligious stranger, who gave no "sign the same day" in proof of his mission, authorizing it. There can be no doubt which he ought to have followed, the more so as the command he had himself received was so remarkably explicit and decisive (ver. 9); so decisive that we can hardly suppose he would have deviated from it, had not the pains of hunger and thirst pleaded powerfully in favour of the pretended revelation of the Bethelite prophet. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that he eagerly welcomed this cause for returning. It is impossible, therefore, to acquit him of disobedience. Nor is it difficult to see that the consequences of this disobedience were serious. It was not as if he had disregarded a mere <span class="accented">positive</span> obligation, the only object of which was to test his obedience (Rawlinson); he had acted in a way calculated to destroy the moral effect of his mission. He had been employed not only to testify publicly against the calf worship, but also to lay the city and the new sanctuary of Jeroboam under an interdict, and by his return that interdict lost much of its force. His eating and drinking, small matters in  themselves, were full of significance. Indeed, he did in one way precisely what Jeroboam and his people were doing in another he forsook the plain commands of God for the ordinances of men; he listened to the tempter and ate the forbidden fruit; and so it came to pass flint, instead of witnessing against disobedience, he himself set them the example of disobedience. It is the story of the Fall over again; and therefore death, the punishment of the Fall, befell him. But before we say that his punishment was too severe, let us remember what, by the mercy of God, that primal punishment has become. It has been turned into a blessing. It has given us the incarnation, redemption, eternal life. We forget that death is not necessarily an evil - is in reality a blessing. One of the heathen has said that if we only knew what the future life was like, we should not be content to live. To this "man of God" it must surely have been gain to die. If the flesh was destroyed, it was that the spirit might be saved (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>). Only because we forget that death is the gate of life do we complain of the severity of his doom. And as to the lying prophet who wrought all this mischief escaping retribution - which, by the way, he did not do, for assuredly he must have had a life-long remorse - it is overlooked that the day of retribution has not yet arrived. There is for him a judgment <span class="accented">to come</span>. It may he said that the Jew did not know of this - that the future life had not then been revealed. That is quite true, and for that very reason this visitation would make all the deeper impression on their minds. To this must be added that the man of God did not die merely or principally because of his sin, but "that the works of God might be made manifest in him." His death was necessary in order that his mission might not be altogether invalidated. His miserable end - as it must have seemed to them - would surely speak to the inhabitants of Bethel and to all Israel and Judah, for long years to come, as to the sure vengeance awaiting the disobedient, whether king, prophet, priest, or people. Though dead "he cried against the altar of Bethel." And the sacred narrative (vers. 26-32) affords us some ground for hoping that the "old prophet" became penitent for his sin. It is noteworthy that he joins his testimony to that of the man of God. Thus, this tragedy extorted even from <span class="accented">him</span> a warning against disobedience (ver. 26), and a confirmation of the prophecy against the altar of Bethel (ver. 32).]

The king is now settled at Tirzah (ver. 17). In <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a> we left him residing at Shechem. The time referred to is that somewhat indefinite period mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33, 34</a>. These opening words clearly connect the sickness with Jeroboam's impenitence. What led the king to move his Court to Tirzah, Shechem being, as we have already seen, not only the capital of Ephraim, but "the natural capital of Palestine," "its central situation, its accessibility, and its wonderfully fine water supply" giving it "advantages not enjoyed by any other city in the land" (Conder), we are not told; but it is interesting and instructive to find that it has one conspicuous disadvantage as a capital, viz., that it is "commanded by a hill on either side so close to the town, that the old geographer, Marino Sanuto, in the fourteenth century, considers the place to be untenable by any military force, because stones might be rolled clown upon the houses, from either Ebal or Gerizim" (Conder, p. 16. Cf. <a href="../../par/judges/9-36.htm">Judges 9:36</a>). It is very probable that this consideration suggested the transfer, of which Ewald despaired of discovering the cause ("Hist. Israel," 4:23)] <span class="cmt_word">Abijah</span> [Rawlinson sees in the name, which means "Jehovah is his father," an indication that Jeroboam "did not intend to desert the worship of Jehovah."

It is more likely that it connects itself, if with anything, with the message of Jehovah to him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-28.htm">1 Kings 11:28</a>). But the name was not uncommon - it was borne by a son of Rehoboam (ver. 31; compare <span class="accented">Ahijah</span>, below), and inferences from names must necessarily be precarious] <span class="cmt_word">the son of Jeroboam fell sick</span>.

The identification, however, was only effected in 1838. Conder gives some interesting particulars which lead him to believe that we can identify the very site of the tabernacle.

Presuming that Tirzah is to be identified with <span class="accented">Teiasir</span> (see on ver. 17) Shiloh would be over thirty miles' distant - more than a day's journey to the queen, as the road involves some toilsome climbing]: <span class="cmt_word">behold, there is Ahijah the prophet</span> [see on 1 Kings 11:29. Shiloh was probably the birthplace, as well as the residence, of Ahijah. It was in the territory of Ephraim (<a href="../../par/joshua/16-6.htm">Joshua 16:6</a>), and at no great distance from Bethel. We can only explain Ahijah's continued residence there, after the migration of the God-fearing Israelites to the southern kingdom, not by his great age, but by the supposition that, having been concerned in the transfer of the kingdom to Jeroboam, he felt it a duty to stay and watch his career. And the time has now come when he can be useful. His relations with Jeroboam had apparently so far been good. He had not protested, so far as we know, against the calf worship, but then God had sent another prophet to do that], <span class="cmt_word">which told me that I should be king</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">he spake of me for king</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>over this people.</span> [So that he had already proved himself a true prophet, and so far a prophet of good.]

But we find the same peculiarity, which some would explain by the fatalism of the East, in <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>, and ch. 8:9, In the present instance, however, no such explanation is needed.

The infatuation which insisted on a disguise for the purpose of deceiving the prophet, who nevertheless was believed to be able to divine the issue of the sickness, is very characteristic, and has had many parallels since.

[Rawlinson only expresses a general feeling when he says that "no satisfactory sense can be obtained from the Hebrew text," and suggests that it is corrupt or defective. The passage, no doubt, is one of extreme difficulty, and inasmuch as the MSS. and Versions lend us no aid to its interpretation, affords scope for conjecture. The explanation I venture to submit may, I hope, contribute - it can hardly do more - to the elucidation of the text. I observe that in ver. 13 <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> is used of Abijah, "this one alone," etc. I assume that it has the same import here, viz., "this one today," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "this one dies or is cut off today," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> being understood as constantly, adverbially, - <span class="accented">hodie</span> (see, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="../../par/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-24.htm">1 Kings 2:24</a>).

It is quite possible (ver. 11) that Jeroboam's wife perished in the wholesale destruction of his house, as it is clear from the severe punishment assigned to her (ver. 12) that she must have shared in his sin. The readiness with which she lent herself to this deceit (ver. 4) also favours the supposition that she had approved his policy. She would then have survived her husband only two years. Keil's explanation, "cut off the house of Jeroboam <span class="accented">this</span> day," appears contrary to actual fact, while to interpret "that day" (with the A.V.) is contrary to Hebrew grammar.]

It is to be observed, however, that the historian says "Judah" (not Rehoboam) "did evil," etc. It is probable that a considerable section of the people approved of the idolatrous practices introduced in the preceding reign, and that Rehoboam was unable to repress them.

[This expedition is related with somewhat more of detail in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-2.htm">2 Chronicles 12:2-4</a>. For Shishak, see <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-40.htm">1 Kings 11:40</a>. It was in the twentieth year of his reign that Shishak, once Jeroboam's protector and friend, invaded Palestine. It has been conjectured (Ewald, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that he was incited so to do by Jeroboam, and that the two kings waged war against Judah in concert (see on ver. 30). But as to this Scripture is silent; and moreover if Jeroboam summoned Shishak to his assistance, it is certain that his own kingdom did not altogether escape invasion; and it is perhaps more probable that the divided and weakened state of the country seemed to promise the Egyptian king an easy capture of Jerusalem, of the treasures of which he had doubtless heard. It is well known that a record of this expedition exists in the sculptures and inscriptions of the great temple at Karnak. The <span class="accented">bassi relievi</span> of the temple wall contain over 130 figures, representatives, as the names on the shields show, of so many conquered cities. Amongst these are found three of the "cities for defence" which Rehoboam had built, viz., Shoco, Adoraim, and Aijalon (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7-10</a>), while many other towns of Palestine, such as Gibeon, Taanach, Shunem, Megiddo, etc., are identified with more or less of probability. One feature in the list is remarkable, viz., the number of Levitical and Canaanite cities - cities of <span class="accented">Israel</span> - which Shishak is said to have conquered. The usual inference is that such cities, although in Jeroboam's dominions, had nevertheless held out against his rule - the former for religious reasons; the latter, perhaps, in the effort to recover their independence. Mr. Peele, however (Dict. Bib., art. "Egypt" ), accounts for the names on the supposition that Shishak directed, his forces against the northern as well as the southern kingdom, and certainly this seems to agree better with the facts. It is hardly likely that Jeroboam, with the army at his command, would tolerate so many centres of disaffection in his midst. Besides, the Levites, we are told, had migrated in a body to Judah; and the Canaanites at this period can hardly have been in a position to defy any Hebrew monarch. The silence alike of our historian and of the chronicler as to the invasion of Israel is easily accounted for by the fact that Judah bore the brunt of the war.]

That the same person is meant is proved as well by the context as by <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/11-21.htm">2 Chronicles 11:21</a>, where the name is given as here. Keil (cf. Dict. Bib. 2:162) ascribes the discrepancy to an error of the copyist; but the names are so unlike in the original as to discountenance this assumption. I venture to suggest that <span class="accented">Michajahu</span> was the significant form - the word means "Who is like Jehovah?" - which the name Maachah, "oppression," borne by the Geshurite princess who married David (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>) assumed when she joined the <span class="accented">Lord's peo</span>ple, and embraced, as no doubt she would <span class="accented">do</span>, the religion of Jehovah. Such a change would be quite in accordance with the genius and traditions of the Semitic races (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-5.htm">Genesis 17:5, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30</a>. <span class="accented">passim</span>; 32:28; 41:45; <a href="../../par/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc. Cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-34.htm">2 Kings 23:34</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4, 6</a>), and there may well have been special reasons in this case, apart from the piety of David, why it should be made. For the name Maachah appears to have been taken Iron the town and district of that name near Geshur - a part of Syria was called <span class="accented">Syria Maachah</span> (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/19-6.htm">1 Chronicles 19:6</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6-8</a>). In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-14.htm">2 Samuel 20:14, 15</a> we read of a district of <span class="accented">Beth Maachah -</span> and it not improbably witnessed to unhappy memories. How natural it would be that David's bride should take a name of better omen and of a religious import, and how natural that the grand-daughter who bore her name should be called by that name in both its forms. Since writing the above, I find that a somewhat similar idea has occurred long since to others. Both Kimchi and Jarchi hold that she had two names. It is supposed by some that she assumed the name <span class="accented">Michaiah</span>, as more dignified, on becoming queen. Wordsworth thinks that Michaiah was her real name, and that it was degraded into Maachah when she was deposed for idolatry. This latter view dovetails with the one suggested above. It  would be quite in accordance with Jewish usages and habits of thought that the name which had been changed into <span class="accented">Michaiah</span> when the grandmother became a proselyte, should be changed back into <span class="accented">Maachah</span> when this princess apostatized], <span class="cmt_word">the daughter</span> [rather, grand-daughter. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> includes all female descendants, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (see ver. 10) all anxestresses] <span class="cmt_word">of Abishalom.</span> We can hardly doubt that Absalom, the son of David, is meant here.

Moreover the variation in spelling is extremely slight. It has been held, however, that a different person is designated by the name, principally because Absalom had but one daughter whose name was Tamar (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>), whereas Abijah's mother is said to have been the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-2.htm">2 Chronicles 13:2</a>). But this difficulty admits of an easy solution. Tamar was doubtless married to Uriel, and Maachah was the fruit of this marriage. And with this explanation agrees the account of Josephus (Ant. 8:10,1).

The stability of the family of David on the throne for nearly 400 years, amid all the changes and chances of that period, and whilst in Israel there were "nine changes of dynasty within 250 years" is, as Rawlinson remarks, very "difficult to account for on mere grounds of human reason"]:

It is very probable that he feared opposition such as Zimri and Omri subsequently experienced. And his wars with Asa and with Syria may well have prevented his renewing the undertaking. On the accession of Elah, however, with the usual ambition and impetuosity of youth, it was decided to recommence the siege and to win this city back for Israel.

Bahr thinks that he had "formerly displayed much partiality for the calf worship." But it is quite as likely that the idea in the historian's mind was that all these events were the bitter fruits of Jeroboam's misguided and impious policy, into the spirit of which, Zimri, like his predecessors, had been baptized. It is interesting to remember here the aspect these repeated revolutions and assassinations would wear to the kingdom of Judah, then enjoying quietness and prosperity under Asa. We cannot doubt for a moment that they were regarded as so many manifestations of the righteous judgment of God, and as the outcomes of that spirit of insubordination and impiety which, in their eyes, had brought about both the division of the kingdom and the schism in the church.]

It is hardly likely that Tibni was set up by the people of Tirzah, after the death of Zimri, to continue the struggle. The only thing that is certain is that,the hereditary principle being overthrown, the crown appeared to be the legitimate prize of the strongest; and Tibni, who may have occupied a position of importance, or have had, somehow, a considerable following, resolved that Omri should not wear it without a fierce contest], <span class="cmt_word">to make him king</span> [Omri had been already made king, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, anointed, ver. 16]; <span class="cmt_word">and half renewed Omri.</span>

Rawlinson proposes to get over the difficulty by rearranging the text. He would attach the first clause of this verse to ver. 22, and read, "And Omri reigned in the thirty-first," etc. But to this there are two serious objections. First, that ver. 23, as it now stands, only follows the usual formula with which a new reign is announced (cf. vers. 8, 15, 29); and, second, it is extremely doubtful whether any prose sentence in the Hebrew ever begins as ver. 23 would then do, "<span class="accented">Reigned</span> <span class="accented">Omri</span> over Israel twelve years." Such a sentence would certainly be quite alien to the <span class="accented">usus</span> <span class="accented">loquendi</span> of our author. We are therefore reduced to the conclusion either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the text here, as in some other instances (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-17.htm">2 Kings 1:17</a>; cf. 3:1; 13:1, 10, etc.), has suffered at the hands of a reviser, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the numbers have been corrupted in transcription; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that the historian expresses himself in a somewhat confused way. Of these suppositions perhaps <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> is the most likely. Anyhow, it is clear that the twelve years of Omri's reign are to be counted not from the thirty-first, but from the twenty-seventh year of Asa, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the date of Zimri's death (see vers. 10, 15, 29).

During the four years of anarchy Omri would seem to have retained possession of the capital which he had taken (ver. 18) on Zimri's death. But the palace being burnt and the defences perhaps weakened by the siege, he determined, rather than rebuild it, to found a capital elsewhere] <span class="cmt_word">the hill Samaria</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">Shomeron</span>, called by Herod <span class="accented">Sebaste</span>, whence its modern name <span class="accented">Sebustieh</span>. In his selection of Samaria for the seat of government, Omri acted with singular judgment. It has been said that "Shechem is the natural capital of Palestine," and no doubt it enjoys a commanding position and great advantages, but Samaria has even superior recommendations. It is a site with which no traveller can fail to be deeply impressed. Even Van de Velde, who says, "I do not agree with Dr. Robinson and other writers who follow him that the mountain of Samaria presents so admirable a combination of strength, fertility, and beauty, that the like is hardly to be found in Palestine" (vol. 1. pp. 374, 375), nevertheless readily allows its superiority to Tirzah, and remarks on the strength of its position. "Many travellers have expressed a conviction that the spot was in most respects much preferable to the site of Jerusalem" (Kitto). It is a large oval or oblong mound, with a level surface, adapted for buildings, with steep sides to make its position  impregnable, and surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills. "Samaria is in a position of great strength., and must before the invention of gunpowder have been almost impregnable. It stands some 400 feet above the valley, the sides of the hill being steep and terraced in every direction for cultivation, or perhaps for defensive purposes.. broad and open valleys stretch north and south, and the hill is thus almost isolated," Conder, p. 47, who adds, "Strategical reasons may be supposed to have dictated the choice of the capital of Omri, for on the north the hill commands the main road to Jezreel over a steep pass, on the west it dominates the road to the coast, and on the east that to the Jordan" (p. 49). Grove (Dict. Bib. 3:1099) speaks of "the singular beauty of the spot," and Stanley ("Jewish Church" it. p. 284) justly sees in the selection of this spot a proof of Omri's sagacity. But perhaps the best proof is that which the subsequent history supplies. Shechem and Tirzah had each been tried, and each in turn had been abandoned. But Samaria continued to be the capital so long as the kingdom lasted] <span class="cmt_word">of Shemer for two talents of silver</span> [variously estimated at &pound;500 and &pound;800. This purchase, obviously of the freehold, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in perpetuity, was in contravention of the law of <a href="../../par/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>.

The reluctance of the Israelite to part with his patrimony, even to the king, is brought out very strikingly in ch. 21. Shemer, in selling his choice parcel of land for a capital, might well wish to connect his name with it. The fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> means <span class="accented">watch mountain</span> (Gesen.), and that we should have expected a name formed from Shemer to take the form <span class="accented">Shimron - Shomeron</span> would strictly imply an original <span class="accented">Shomer</span> - is not by any means a proof that our historian is at fault in his derivation. For, in the first place, the names Shomer and Shemer are used of the same person in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-32.htm">1 Chronicles 7:32, 34</a>. And secondly, nothing would be more in accordance with Jewish ideas than that Omri, in naming the hill after its owner, should give a turn to the word which would also express at the same time its characteristic feature. A pun, or play upon word, was the form which wit assumed amongst the Semitic races (as, indeed, is the case still, see Conder, p. 801), and the form <span class="accented">Shomeron</span> would at once perpetuate the memory of Shemer, and express the hope and purpose of Omri. It is a curious fact that the later Samaritans did play upon this very word, representing themselves as <span class="accented">guardians</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) of the law (Ewald).

THE REIGN OF AHAB. - With the accession of Ahab a new main section of our history begins - the section which has its close in the destruction of the house of Omri by Jehu, as related in <a href="../../par/2_kings/10.htm">2 Kings 10</a>. And this reign is recorded at unusual length; in fact, it occupies nearly all the remaining portion of this volume, whereas the reigns of preceding kings have in several instances been dismissed in a few verses. It owes this distinction to the ministry of the great prophet Elijah by which it was marked, and, indeed, was profoundly influenced; but this ministry, it must be remembered, was necessitated by the critical circumstances of the time. It may be that "every age thinks itself a crisis," but no one can fail to see that this was one of the veritable turning points of Jewish history. One of the real "decisive battles of the world" - that between the Lord and Baal - was then fought out. No wonder that our historian felt constrained to chronicle at length the transactions of a reign so pregnant both with good and evil for the people of the Lord and for the faith with which they had been put in trust. Indeed, the same guiding principle which led him to devote so many of his pages to the reign of Solomon, when the theocratic kingdom was at its highest, impelled him to linger over the reign of Ahab when religion was at its lowest ebb. The secular historian, too often like the sundial which "counts no hours save those serene," draws a veil over the time of his country's decadence, or touches its misfortunes with a  light hand. It is only in the inspired records that we have an impartial register both of the glory and shame of a common. wealth.

The latter had gone beyond his predecessors in the matter of the calf worship. See note on ver. 25. But the calf worship, however it may have deteriorated in process of time - and it is the tendency of such systems to wax worse and worse - was nevertheless a cult, though a corrupt, and unauthorized, and illicit cultus, of the one true God. Under Ahab, however, positive idolatry was established and fostered the worship of foreign and shameful deities.]

It does not appear that (Keil) he was the brother of Pheles. Pheles, however, was certainly a fratricide. (Rawlinson reminds us that Jezebel was great-aunt to Pygmalion and Dido.) This statement helps to explain Jezebel's fierce and sanguinary character, and at the same time accounts for her great devotion to the gods of her country, and for her determined efforts to establish their impure rites in her husband's kingdom.

But it is by no certain  that the current interpretaioni not the best. Such a play upon words as it involves is not at all uncommon in Hebrew.

The only objection to this rendering - apart from the identity of radicals just <span class="accented">mentioned -</span> is that we should have expected to find <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> written <span class="accented">plene</span>, as the word always is elsewhere.

It is clear, then, that the usual <span class="accented">interpretation is</span> by no <span class="accented">means</span> to be lightly set aside. It is certainly preferable to the rendering, "Elijah the stranger," etc., for we have no proof that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> can bear this meaning. In favour of the alternative rendering "the Tishbite of Tishbe," it may be said that it has the support of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and of Josephus (Ant. 8:13. 2), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. Nor is it any weighty objection to this view that we now here read of a Tishbe in Gilead: as for the matter of that, we have no undoubted traces of any such place <span class="accented">west</span> of the Jordan; the passage in Tobit (ch. 1:2, LXX.), which is often alleged as proving that there was a Tishbe in Galilee, and from which Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, etc., <span class="accented">conclude</span> that this must be the Tishbi here referred to, being too uncertain to permit us to build any positive conclusions thereupon. See Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1489, 1516. In any case - and it is <span class="accented">perhaps impossible</span> to decide positively between this and the rendering of the A.V. - it is clear that Elijah, even if born in Galilee (but see <a href="../../par/john/7-52.htm">John 7:52</a>, for the belief of the Jews), was trained for his work in Gilead.

"The fact that this <span class="accented">mission</span> was entrusted not to a dweller in royal city or prophetic school, but to a genuine child of the deserts and forests of Gilead, is in exact accordance with the dispensations of Providence in other times" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">said unto Ahab</span> [The abrupt way in which Elijah appears upon the scene without a word of introduction or explanation is certainly remarkable.

"Elijah comes in with a <span class="accented">tempest</span>, and goes out with a whirlwind" (Hall). But there is no sufficient ground for believing (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.) that a part of our history which described some of his antecedents has been lost to us, or that our text merely recites the <span class="accented">issue</span> of a long conference which Elijah had held with Ahab, for other prophets of this period, Ahijah, Shemaiah, Jehu, are introduced to us in a similar manner, though it must be allowed that their respective ministries were of very different proportions and importance from Elijah's. This sudden appearance, however, is thoroughly characteristic of the man. He presently disappears just as suddenly (ver. 5. Cf. 19:3; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>).

Elijah directly challenges them to a trial of strength. It was as if he had said, "The God that answereth by rain, let him be God." On the fitness  of this miracle, both as a sign and as a punishment, see "Homil. Quart." 5:100,101.

In support of the received rendering is the very powerful consideration, that it is the interpretation of all the versions (except the Arabic) and of Josephus, who, beyond all question, represented the belief current in his own time (Ant. 8:13. 2). It is also certain that elsewhere in Scripture we find some of the inferior animals supernaturally constrained to effect God's purposes, both of mercy and of judgment (<a href="../../par/1_kings/13-24.htm">1 Kings 13:24</a>;  <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_peter/2-16.htm">2 Peter 2:16</a>), though never it must be said, in so rational and methodical a way. Nor can it rightly be contended that the words "I have commanded," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, imply human agency, for elsewhere we find the Almighty <span class="accented">commanding</span> (same word) the serpent (<a href="../../par/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>) and the clouds (<a href="../../par/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/78-23.htm">Psalm 78:23</a>). It is not, however, a sufficient account of this narrative to say that the prophet merely helped himself to the food which the ravens, whose <span class="accented">habitat</span> was in the Wady Cherith, brought, day by day, to their nests and their young. For, not to insist on the words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> <span class="accented">bringing to him</span> (ver. 6), the expressions '" bread (or <span class="accented">food</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span>) and flesh," and "morning and evening" certainly point to something more than such a fortuitous supply. Whether the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were "ravens" or not, they certainly acted in an intelligent and rational way: they brought food, that is to say, to the <span class="accented">prophet</span>, and they brought it for months together with unfailing regularity. But against this view the following considerations may be urged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> It is hardly in accord with God's <span class="accented">usual</span> way of working, that he should employ birds of the air and those unclean (<a href="../../par/leviticus/11-15.htm">Leviticus 11:15</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-14.htm">Deuteronomy 14:14</a>) and ravenous birds, to feed and succour His saints, rather than men or angels. Of course, no one who does not altogether repudiate the supernatural will deny for a moment that the Almighty <span class="accented">could, had</span> it seemed good to Him, have sustained His prophet by the instrumentality of ravens, just as easily as by any other means. But it appears to be almost a fixed principle of His dealings with men, not to resort to miracles when ordinary means will suffice; or if He does employ miracles, they are never <span class="accented">bizarre</span> or fantastic; they are not such as to suggest the idea of fable or legend; they are invariably the simplest and directest means to the end. And it is submitted that this prolonged and methodical ministry of ravens is altogether unlike God's method of procedure on other occasions. It was an angel succoured Hagar and Ishmael in their need (<a href="../../par/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>). It was an angel fed Elijah himself, a few years later (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5, 6</a>). They were angels who ministered to our blessed Lord after His long fast (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>). But God's,' chief means," it is always to be remembered, "is man." And it is to be carefully observed that when, about this very time, not one, but one hundred prophets were threatened, just as Elijah was, with death, <span class="cmt_word">no</span> miracle was wrought to save their lives or to supply their wants, but they were fed by human agency, with bread and water (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>). But it is still more significant that elsewhere in this narrative, which is characterized by the profoundest sobriety and reticence, there is what we may almost call a studied absence of the miraculous element. No miracle is wrought to protect Elijah against Jezebel, but he must consult for his own safety by flight. He is sent to the brook Cherith, because there is <span class="accented">water</span> there; in other words, God chose that hiding place in order to obviate the necessity for a miracle. And when the water of the brook dries up, no miracle is wrought to prolong the supply, but the prophet, at the risk of detection, must go forth and seek it elsewhere. And at Zarephath he is fed, not by ravens, but by human agency - by a widow woman. It is true a miracle appears to have been wrought, but the narrative has so little idea of effect and gives so little prominence to the supernatural that even that is doubted. To put the interpretation of "ravens," consequently, on the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, provided it will yield any other meaning, appears to be to do violence to the spirit of the context, and to the tenour of Scripture generally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> It is somewhat difficult to believe that such a prodigy as this, so altogether unique and irregular, would not have been mentioned, had it really happened, elsewhere in Scripture. The absence of all reference thereto is remarkable, when we consider how constantly the ministry of Elijah and its lessons (<a href="../../par/luke/4-25.htm">Luke 4:25, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/11-5.htm">Revelation 11:5, 6</a>) are referred to in the New Testament; but when we observe what an admirable and unequalled illustration of God's providential care this incident would have supplied to some of our Lord's discourses, and notably to that of <a href="../../par/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22</a> sqq., this silence becomes almost suspicious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Despite the practical unanimity of the versions, the interpretation "ravens" has been disputed from very early times. St. Jerome among Christians, Rabbi Judah Hakkodesh and Kimchi amongst Jews - these are but some of those who have repudiated this rendering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> A very slight change in the vowel points - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> - yields the meaning "Arabians." That a fugitive would readily find, not only shelter but sustenance among the Bedouin, whose generous hospitality and loyalty to strangers is proverbial, is obvious, and we knew that about this time some Arab tribes had dealings with the Jews (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/17-11.htm">2 Chronicles 17:11</a>); but without any change at all, a sufficient meaning may be extracted from the word. For we find that somewhere in the <span class="accented">Ciccar</span>, or plain of the Jordan, off which the Wady Cherith lay, was a rock Oreb (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>, <a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>), apparently east of the Jordan (<a href="../../par/judges/8-1.htm">Judges 8:1</a>),  but in any case, at no great distance from Bethabara (<a href="../../par/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>). Now Beth-abara has been identified, almost to a certainty (Conder, "Tent-work," pp. 229-232) with the modern <span class="accented">Abarah</span> (<span class="accented">i.e., passage</span> or <span class="accented">ferry</span>), "one of the main fords of the Jordan just above the place where the Jalud river flowing down the valley of Jezreel and <span class="accented">by Beisan</span>, debouches into Jordan." But we learn from an ancient and independent source, the <span class="accented">Bereshith Rabba</span> (see Dict. Bib. ii. 464), that in the neighbourhood of <span class="accented">Beisan, i.e.</span>, Bethshean, there was anciently a town named <span class="accented">Orbo</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;</span> - a word, it is to be observed, which preserves the radicals of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> transposed. We may safely assume that these two places, Orbo and Oreb, were identical; that the former was the representative at a later day of the latter, or was the shape which the name assumed when bestowed on the hamlet, as distinct from the rock. The inhabitants of this place would, of course, be called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, just as the in. habitants of Ziph were known as <span class="accented">Ziphim</span> (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1</a>), or the men of Zidon as <span class="accented">Zidonim</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-6.htm">1 Kings 5:6</a>). We find, consequently, that this word, which means "ravens," also designates the inhabitants of a village near Bethshean, and probably east of the Jordan; that is to say, in or near Elijah's native country of Gilead. And with this agree the testimonies of Rabbi Judah and Jerome already referred to. The former held that the <span class="accented">Orebim</span> were not ravens at all, but inhabitants of Orbo or the rock Oreb, while the latter says, with equal positiveness, <span class="accented">Orbim, accolae villae in fini-bus Arabum, Eliae dederunt alimenta</span>. It only remains for us to notice the perfect naturalness and consistency of the narrative thus interpreted. Elijah is bidden to go <span class="accented">eastward</span>; to hide in the Wady Cherith, where he would be among tribesmen or friends. For water, there is the brook; for food, the Orbites, whose name would be familiar to him, and whom he may have known, are commanded to feed him. He goes; he is received with Arab hospitality; the Eastern law of <span class="accented">Dakheel</span>, by which any man at any time is entitled to throw himself upon the mercy and protection of another, ensures his safety. The Orebim minister assiduously to his wants. Every morning before the dawn, every evening after dark, they bring him bread and flesh.]

But if we may believe that the prophet was, if not among kinsmen or friends, yet among the pastoral, semi-nomadic people of Gilead, a people, that is to say, like the Bedawin in their instincts and customs, it is easy to understand that having taken him under their protection, they would make a point of visiting him regularly, not only to show him all possible honour, as a person endued with supernatural powers (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-7.htm">1 Kings 18:7, 13</a>), but to afford him some measure of sympathy and companionship.

He further suggests that possibly she was an Israelite by birth, who had been married to a Phoenician. But all this is extremely doubtful. In the first place, it is noteworthy that the words are, "Jehovah <span class="accented">thy</span> God," words which show that she recognized Elijah, perhaps by his Jewish face, probably by his prophetic dress (<a href="../../par/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>) as a worshipper of Jehovah.

[The "first" and "afterwards" are emphatic by position. When Bahr says that Elijah would never have made this demand, and that still less would the widow have paid any attention to it, had she been a heathen, he appears to forget the words that followed (ver. 14). When one in the garb of a prophet swore, as this man did, by the sacred name, a heathen, with the belief of the heathen in miracles, might well be persuaded that the word was truth. Elijah's manner alone would carry conviction with it.]

But clearly, if there was nothing else, there was supernatural knowledge on Elijah's part. And it cannot be denied that the literal construction of the words points to a "supernatural and inexplicable multiplication of food" (Rawlinson), similar to those of which the Gospels tell. It is just possible that this was a figure of speech, which practically meant no more than the necessaries of life should somehow be provided, directly or indirectly, by God.

The object of the touch, of anointing the eyes, etc., in these cases of healing, appears to have been to awaken a sufficient faith - without which "He could do no miracle" (<a href="../../par/matthew/13-58.htm">Matthew 13:58</a>) - in men whose infirmities of blindness, deafness, etc., prevented their attaining faith through the ordinary channels of seeing and hearing the merciful and gracious Son of man. But here the child, if not dead, was senseless. We are driven, therefore, to the belief that the prophet "used rational means for warming and revivifying" the child, "not with the hope that of themselves they would prove effectual, but in the sure confidence that God, in answer to his weeping supplication, would impart supernatural force to the natural human agencies," Bahr] <span class="cmt_word">three times</span> [Not only in his prayer but also in this triple repetition do we recognize Elijah's profound conviction that only by the Almighty power of God could the child be restored, and that whatever means were used, God alone could make them effectual.

Massillon's graphic language (vol. 1. p. 91, ed. 1858), showing the contrast between Elijah's procedure and that of our blessed Lord (<a href="../../par/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-54.htm">Luke 8:54</a>; <a href="../../par/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43</a>), is worth citing here: "Elie ressuscite des morts, il est vrai; mais il est oblige de se coucher plusieurs fois sur le corps de l'enfant qu'il ressuscite; il souffle, il se retrecit, it s'agite; on voit bien qu'il invoque une puissance etrangere; qu'il rappelle de l'empire de ta mort une ame qui n'est pas soumise a savoix, et qu'il n'est pas lui-meme le maitre de la mort et de la vie: Jesus-Christ ressuscite les morts comme il fait les actions les plus communes; il parle en maitre a ceux qui dorment d'un sommeil eternel, et l'on sent bien qu'il est le Dieu des morts comme des vivants, jamais plus tranquille que lorsqu'il opere les plus grandes choses."]

The words do suggest, however, that it had been believed by some that the Lord had hid Elijah, and it is not improbable that during his long absence rumours had often gained credence that he had been seen and had suddenly disappeared, just as later Jews have held that he "has appeared again and again as an Arabian merchant to wise and good Rabbis at their prayers or in their journeys" (Stanley)]; <span class="cmt_word">and so when I come and tell</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and I come to tell</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me</span> [This is just what a prince like Ahab, or any prince who was under the guidance of a Jezebel, would do, out of sheer vexation at losing his prey when so nearly in his grasp]: <span class="cmt_word">but</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and</span>] <span class="cmt_word">I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth.</span> [Obadiah's meaning clearly is not that he, "as a God-fearing man and a protector of the prophets, cannot have any special favour to expect from Ahab" (Keil; similarly Ewald), but that it was hard that one who was a steadfast worshipper of Elijah's God should be slain for his sake.

Cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1-5</a>. It is "the park of Palestine." It is indebted for this name to the luxuriant vegetation - "the excellency of Carmel" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/35-2.htm">Isaiah 35:2</a>) - which clothes its southern slopes (Porter, p. 371; Stanley, S. and P. pp. 352-54, and App. p. 14; Van de Velde, 1. pp. 317, 318). It is now generally called <span class="accented">Mar</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Lord or Saint) <span class="accented">Elyas</span>, after the great prophet. No one who has seen the locality can have any doubts as to which part of the mountain was the scene of the sacrifice, or can fail to be struck with the singular fitness of the place to be the theatre of this thrilling history. Carmel is rather a ridge than a mountain, some twelve miles in length. Its western (or strictly N.N.W.) extremity is a bold headland, some 600 feet in height, which dips almost directly into the waters of the Mediterranean. Its highest point, 1728 feet above the sea level, is about four miles from its eastern extremity, which, at an elevation of 1600 feet, rises like a wall from the great plain of Esdraelon. It is at this point, there can be no question, we are to place the scene of the burnt sacrifice. The identification has only been effected in comparatively recent days (1852), but it is beyond dispute. Not only does the Arab name which it bears <span class="accented">- El Murahkah</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> <span class="accented">Burning</span>," or "<span class="accented">Sacrifice"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> afford striking witness to the identity, but the situation and surroundings adapt themselves with such wonderful precision to the requirements of the narrative as to leave no reasonable doubt in the mind. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it is a sort of natural platform, or pulpit, raised 1000 feet above the adjoining plain, and therefore well calculated to afford a view of the proceedings, or at least of the descent of the Holy Fire, to spectators of all Israel. The flame would probably be seen by Jezebel in her palace at Jezreel. This eminence is visible from Nazareth, some twenty miles away. "There is not a more conspicuous spot on all Carmel than the abrupt, rocky height of El Murahkah, shooting up so suddenly on the east" (Van de Velde, 1. pp. 322, 323). "The summit...  commands the last view of the sea behind and the first  view of the great plain in front" (Stanley). In fact, it was in its way just as well adapted for the solemn vindication of the law which took place there as <span class="accented">Jebel Sufsafeh</span> was for the giving of the law. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A sort of plateau near the summit - the table land where the altars were built, etc. - would accommodate a vast number of spectators (ver. 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> There is a spring of water close at hand - less than 100 yards distant - and a spring which is said to flow even in the driest seasons, which would supply the water of which we read in vers. 4, 33-35. Josephus (Ant. 8:13, 5) says it came from the fountain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> The sea, though not visible from the plateau itself, is seen from a point some 300 feet higher, a detail which accords admirably with the account of vers. 42-44. It may be added that the place is still held sacred by the Druses, and reverenced by "Jews, Christians, Moslems, and Bedouin as the site of these miracles of Elijah" (Thomson). The traveller, consequently, cannot doubt for a moment, as he stands on the table-land of <span class="accented">El</span> <span class="accented">Murahkah</span> and looks across the great plain to Jezreel and the heights of Galilee and Samaria, that he is on the very spot sanctified by the descent of the heavenly fire. It should be added, as explaining the selection of Carmel by Elijah, that its situation is central end convenient; that it is near the sea, from whence the rain clouds would come; that it is easy of access from Jezreel; and that it was not only a holy place from earlier times (cf. <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-23.htm">2 Kings 4:23</a>), but also had its altar of Jehovah, an altar, no doubt, in constant use when the people "sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places," but which had in later days fallen into neglect, and was now broken down. It was every way, therefore, a <span class="accented">most appropriate</span> locality for the public vindication of the despised and outraged law of God.

The LXX. inserts "and the prophets of the grove, four hundred," but the words are evidently added from ver. 19. The Baal prophets would doubtless have been only too glad to do the same, but they were under the immediate command of the king. It is not certain that they had any forebodings of evil, or dreaded reprisals on Elijah's part, but they had had proof conclusive of his power and of their impo-fence. We must remember that all through the triennium prayers and sacrifices had, no doubt, been constantly offered with a view to procure rain. We learn from Menander (Jos., 8:13. 2) that even in Phoenicia supplication had been made for rain by Ethabaal.

One sentence may be transcribed here: "He cuts and hacks and hews himself, and not unfrequently kills himself there and then."

That they did not lend any <span class="accented">real</span> sanction to those irregularities is clear, however, to us. For, in the first place, priests were not to be had, all having long since left the kingdom.

"In such springs the water remains always cool, under the shade of a vaulted roof, and with no hot atmosphere to evaporate it.

It would almost seem as if tricks not unlike that practised year by year at the Greek Easter at Jerusalem were familiar to that age.

Bahr, however, sees in these 3 x 4 vessels of water a symbolical act. The significance of this combination, he says, is unmistakable (cf. "Symbolik" 1. pp. 150, 169, 193, 205), though we cannot be certain as to the precise meaning of the prophetic act.

That he slew them all with his own hand is altogether out of the question. Nor is it clear that" sword in hand he stood over them" (Stanley). Josephus rightly explains: "they slew the prophets at Elijah's instigation." It is almost certain, from their resorting to the Kishon for this purpose, that it was not quite dry at the time. Their blood would mingle with its waters, and the flood which the "great rain" would presently produce (cf. <a href="../../par/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>) would carry their corpses down to the sea. It has often been supposed that the mound near the Kishon, known as <span class="accented">Tell el Cassis</span>, "the mound of the priests," derives its name from this slaughter of the prophets of Baal. But Conder (p. 90) remarks that "Kassis is the word applied to a Christian priest, and the word Kohen or Kamir would more naturally be expected if there was any real connexion with the idolatrous priests of Baal."] This action of the prophet Elijah in instituting this wholesale slaughter in the hour of his triumph has been repeatedly arraigned and denounced, but most unjustly. According to some, it was an act of gross fanaticism and cruelty; others have seen it in a wild and terrible <span class="accented">vendetta</span> for the murder of the Lord's prophets. By some, indeed, it has been justified on the principles of the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, etc.); on the ground, that is to say, that the men who had instigated Jezebel in her attempted extermination of the prophetic schools had merited extermination in their turn. But <span class="cmt_word">it</span> is a fatal objection to their view, first, that we not only have no proof, but no reason for thinking, that it was at their  instigation that the queen "cut off the prophets of the Lord;" and, secondly, that it is not clear that she succeeded in her sanguinary purpose, or that many lives were sacrificed to her fury. And Elljah's action needs no such lame apologies. As the Lord's prophet, as the vindicator and restorer of the law, there was no other course open to him. If the Mosaic law was then written, and this very incident is one of the proofs that it was then written; if, however it had fallen into contempt or desuetude, it was still binding upon Israel; and if Elijah was justified in executing its provisions, and was required to execute them, however repugnant they might be to his inclinations (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-26.htm">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>), then he could not have done otherwise than he did. For it was an essential part of that law, it was an obligation that was laid, not once or twice, but on three separate occasions (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13.htm">Deuteronomy 13</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-2.htm">Deuteronomy 17:2-7</a>), on the Jewish people, it was a duty they were to perform, however distressing and harrowing it might be (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-9</a>), to provide that the worshipper of false gods, and especially the teacher of such worship, should be put to death. It was primarily, of course, the duty of the authorities, of the theocratic king and his subordinates, to execute these injunctions. But the king of that age was corrupt and powerless - nay, was himself idolatrous. So great was the depravity of the time that the false prophet enjoyed the favour and protection of the court, and the true prophet was everywhere being hunted to death. The execution of this law, consequently, could not be expected from the king. It must be executed, if at all, in spite of him, and in disregard of his protests. It was only Elijah, therefore, could put it into force, and Elijah only in the hour of his triumph. And the <span class="accented">jus</span> <span class="accented">zelotyparum</span>, the right claimed by every faithful Jew to execute vengeance, after the example of Phinehas (<a href="../../par/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>), upon any gross breach of the Divine law committed in his presence, was not his only warranty; he held a commission, higher than the king's, as the prophet of the Most High. He had just proved that the Lord He was God. It was now for him to prove that God's law was no dead letter. It was for him to cut off the men - some of them renegades from the faith of Israel, some of them foreign emissaries introduced into the land who had corrupted his countrymen, and threatened the very existence of the true religion. It is necessary, therefore, for those who challenge his conduct in this respect, who call him sanguinary, vindictive, etc., to settle their account with the law which he obeyed, and, indeed, with Him who has approved this deed, and has forewarned us that He too will act in like manner (<a href="../../par/luke/19-27.htm">Luke 19:27</a>). For this terrible retribution is by no means an exceptional or isolated act, in contrast to the general spirit of that dispensation; on the contrary, it is in thorough accord with the system out of which it sprung. We gain nothing, therefore, by repudiating this one transaction. For clearly, in the first place, it was allowed and approved of God, who otherwise would hardly have answered the prayer which Elijah presently offered, and (2) other similar acts have distinctly received Divine commendation (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25-28</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7-13</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a> sqq.) It is true that the spirit of Elias was not the spirit of Christianity (<a href="../../par/luke/9-56.htm">Luke 9:56</a>), but it is forgotten how different was the dispensation of Elijah from that of the New Covenant. In that age idolaters must receive their just recompense of reward, because the judgment to come had not then been revealed; because justice must be measured out to men in this life. We do not avenge idolatry or irreligion now with fire and sword, not because the thing is any the less sinful, but because the duty has been taken out of our hands; because our religion instructs us to leave it to Him who has said, "Vengeance is Mine," etc. It is perhaps worth remarking here that there is nothing in this history half so dreadful as might be seen on a thousand battlefields - and those not battlefields for truth and right - on which, nevertheless, Elijah's critics have learned to look with complacency. It may, however, be objected to this view that the punishment denounced by the law was stoning (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>). But surely it is easy to see why, in this particular, the law was not kept. It was simply that the exigency of the occasion did not  permit of its being kept. It was because the 450 traitors to God and their country could not be stoned within the few hours that remained before the night closed in and the multitude dispersed, that a more speedy punishment, that of the sword, was adopted. And it would have been a sacrifice of the spirit of the law to the letter had some few false prophets been stoned and the rest thereby been afforded the opportunity to escape, and, under Jezebel's protection, to renew their efforts against truth and morality and religion.

The next words assign the reason why he should eat and drink. It is a mistake, however (Ewald, Rawlinson), to suppose that he was bidden to "eat of the feast which always followed a sacrifice," for this was a whole burnt offering and had been entirely consumed (ver. 38).

Similarly the latest authority, Mr. Condor: "The peak is a semi-isolated knoll with a cliff some forty feet high, looking southeast ....

This earnest prayer for rain under these circumstances suggests that the former prayer "that it might not rain" (<a href="../../par/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>) had also been inspired of God. But it is worth considering whether Elijah's attitude was not one of reverent and assured expectation, as  much as of prayer.

An impulse from on high impelled him to "gird up his loins" and go with the king; a strength not his own sustained him whilst "he ran," etc. The distance across the plain to Jezreel is about fourteen miles; the royal chariot would drive furiously, and whatever fleetness and endurance the prophet had acquired in the wilds of Gilead, it seems hardly likely that, after the fatigues and excitement of that day, he would have been able, without the hand of the Lord upon him, to keep ahead of the chariot horses], <span class="cmt_word">and he girded up his loins</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, gathered round his waist the <span class="accented">abba</span>, or "mantle" - the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/2-13.htm">2 Kings 2:13, 14</a>) was so-called from its ample size - which would otherwise have impeded his movements. Probably this, apart from the girdle, was his sole garment. (See Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 232)], <span class="cmt_word">and ran before Ahab</span> [Thomson (vol. 2. p. 227) mentions an interesting illustration of this incident which he witnessed. The forerunners of Mohammed All Pasha "kept just ahead of the horses, no matter how furiously they were ridden, and in order to run with the greatest ease they not only girded their loins very tightly, but also tucked up their loose garments under the girdle." But such a spectacle is of common occurrence in the East. Kitto remarks that the <span class="accented">Shatirs</span> of Persia keep pace with ease with their masters' horses. They also are tightly girded. His object was apparently twofold. First, to honour the sovereign whom he had that day humbled in the presence of his subjects. The great prophet, by assuming the lowly office of a <span class="accented">footman</span>, or forernnner (see note on 1 Kings 1:5), would give due reverence to the Lord's anointed, like Samuel on a somewhat similar occasion (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30, 31</a>). Secondly, he may have hoped by his presence near the king and court to strengthen any good resolves which the former might have made, and to further the work of  reformation which he could not but hope the proceedings of that day would inaugurate. That this tribute of respect would be grateful to Ahab, who hitherto had only regarded Elijah as an adversary, it is impossible to doubt. And that Elijah believed he had struck a death blow to the foreign superstitions fostered by the court, and especially by the queen, is equally certain. It is not clear, as Bahr assumes, that his servant accompanied him on the road. He may have rejoined him later on in the day or night] <span class="cmt_word">to the entrance</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">until thou comest</span> to. The Arab aversion, which Elijah is supposed to have shared, to entering cities, has often been remarked. But there were other and deeper reasons why he should not adventure himself within the city. Probably the same guiding hand which led him to Jezreel impelled him to lodge outside the walls. It was impossible to say what Jezebel, in her transports of rage, might do. After such a day, too, any prophet would shrink from familiar contact with men and from the strife of tongues] <span class="cmt_word">of Jezreel.</span> [Ahab had a palace here (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1</a>). But Samaria was still the capital, and so remained till the captivity (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-37.htm">1 Kings 22:37</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5, 6</a>). The selection of Jezreel as a royal residence is easily accounted for. It stands on "a knoll 500 feet high" (Conder), overlooking both the plain of Esdraelon and the valley of Jezreel. In fact, it is the finest situation in the "Great Plain." Hence perhaps its name "the sowing place of God." See Stanley, S. and P. pp. 336 sqq.; Porter, p. 353; Dict.

Stanley appositely recalls to our minds "the tremendous vows which mark the history of the Semitic race, both within and without the Jewish pale, the vow of Jephthah, the vow of Saul, the vow of Hannibal." Rawlinson remarks that this oath was "familiar in the mouths of kings about this time" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-10.htm">1 Kings 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/6-31.htm">2 Kings 6:31</a>).

["That queen consort, it seems, was, in effect, queen regent" (Henry). What induced the queen to send this message? For it is obvious that if she really meant to slay Elijah, she took the very means to defeat her purpose by thus forewarning him of her intentions. Some of the older expositors (see, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g.</span>, Hall, vol. 2. p. 396) have seen in the act a proof of her blind infatuation, of that infatuation which God often employs to defeat the machinations of wicked men, and this view is not to be lightly rejected. That she fully meant what she said is hardly to be doubted. But later writers, including Keil, Bahr, and Wordsworth, see in the threat nothing more than a scheme for ridding herself of the presence of Elijah. They argue that, finding herself unable to put him to death, partly because of the impression he had made upon the people, and partly, too, because of the ascendancy he had just gained over the king, she resolved, by threatening him with instant death, to give him an opportunity for flight. But this view hardly takes sufficiently into account the exasperation, the blind unreasoning hate, or the reckless and desperate character of the queen. It must be remembered that this message was despatched, not after she had had time for thought and calculation, but on the spur of the moment, as soon as she had heard of the massacre of the priests of Baal. That night she could do nothing, nor perhaps could she see her way clearly to compass his death on the morrow. But she will have him know that he is not going to escape her, and that, whatever the effect on her husband, <span class="accented">she</span> is unconquered and unrelenting. She does not stop to argue that he may take the alarm and flee. But she must gratify her impotent rage forthwith by threatening him with death the next day.]

A few MSS. have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> and it certainly suits the context better. Bahr, who interprets, "he saw how matters stood," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that she meant him to flee, is not justified in asserting that this expression would require an accusative of the person feared. (See, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., <a href="../../par/genesis/3-10.htm">Genesis 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-15.htm">Genesis 18:15</a>.) Both he and Keil furthermore object to this interpretation that it is contrary to actual fact, neither of them being willing to allow that Elijah was afraid. Bahr says it is inconceivable that the man who had that day faced alone king and priests and the entire people should have become all at once afraid of a bad woman, and he explains Elijah's flight as caused by the discovery that he could not carryon his work of reformation, and by the absence of any intimation (like that of <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>) that he was to stay and hazard his life. But apart from the fact that we are distinctly told that he "went <span class="accented">for his life"</span> (cf. vers. 4, 10), and that his flight seems to have been instant and hurried, history tells of many great souls, hardly less brave than Elijah's, which have succumbed to a sudden panic. Anyhow, it is evident that for the moment Elijah had lost faith in God, otherwise he would certainly have waited for the "word of the Lord," which had hitherto invariably guided his movements (<a href="../../par/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-1.htm">1 Kings 18:1</a>). No doubt other emotions besides that of fear were struggling  in his breast, and prominent among these was the feeling of profound disappointment and mortification. It is clear that he had hoped that the "day of Carmel" would turn the heart of the entire nation back again (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37</a>), and the great shout of ver. 39, and the subsequent execution, at his command, of the men who had deceived and depraved the people, might well justify the most sanguine expectations. We can readily imagine, consequently, how, especially after the excitement and fatigues of that day, the threatening and defiant message of the queen would seem the death blow of his hopes, and how, utterly dispirited and broken down, he lost all trust, all faith, and, while fleeing for his life, "requested for himself that he might die" (ver. 4)], <span class="cmt_word">he arose, and went for his life</span> [Keil is compelled, by his refusal to allow that Elijah was actuated by fear, to render these words, "went to commit his soul to God in the solitude of the desert."

The southern boundary of Palestine (<a href="../../par/joshua/15-28.htm">Joshua 15:28</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-7.htm">2 Samuel 24:7</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>, etc.), allotted to the tribe of Simeon (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2</a>), which tribe, we gather from this passage (see also <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-4.htm">2 Chronicles 19:4</a>), was now absorbed in the southern kingdom. (See note on ch. 11:31.) Wordsworth suggests that "perhaps he resorted to Beer-sheba in order to strengthen his faith with the recollection of the patriarchs who had dwelt there," etc. But if that had been his object, a journey to the place was hardly necessary, and it is clear that he only passed through it on his way to Mount Sinai. "Beer-sheba was about 95 miles from Jezreel" - Rawlinson, who adds that Elijah cannot have reached it till the close of the second day. But we must remember that his pace would be regulated by the powers of his servant, probably a mere lad (LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), so that it is hardly likely he could travel day and night without stopping to rest], which belongeth to Judah [It is part of Keil's argument in proof that Elijah did not flee from fear of Jezebel, that, had such been the case, he would have remained in the kingdom of Judah, where he would have enjoyed the protection of Jehoshaphat. But it is by no means certain that this prince, considering his close alliance with Ahab (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4</a>; cf. 18:10; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/18-1.htm">2 Chronicles 18:1</a>), would have sheltered the prophet. Indeed, it is remarkable, as Blunt has well pointed out (Coincid. pp. 183, 184), that the prophet <span class="accented">never</span> took refuge in the southern kingdom. At one time he found a sanctuary beyond the Jordan; at another in the kingdom of Tyre, but never in the realm of Jehoshaphat. When he does come in haste to Beer-sheba, "it is after a manner which bespeaks his reluctance to set foot within that territory, even more than if he had evaded it altogether." The reason partly was, no doubt, as Wordsworth says, that his mission was to idolatrous Israel. Judah had both priests and prophets of its own], <span class="cmt_word">and left his servant</span> [There is no warrant for the assertion (Stanley) that "one only of that vast assembly remained faithful to him, the Zidonian boy of Zarephath." The identity of this boy with the servant is by no means certain; nor is the defection of the people at all proven] <span class="cmt_word">there</span>. [Probably because he wished to be alone with God; possibly because the boy was then too exhausted to go further, and there was no reason why he should be subjected to the uncertainties and privations of desert life; hardly for the security of both (Blunt). It is perhaps implied, however, that the kingdom of Judah, though not a safe abode for him, would be for his servant.

But the primary reference is perhaps to the "forty days and forty nights" which Moses spent in Horeb, during which he "neither did eat bread nor drink water" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>), or to the forty years during which Israel was sustained in this same desert with "angels' food" (<a href="../../par/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>). It is noteworthy how both Moses and Elias were precursors of our Lord in a forty days' fast. "The three great fasters met gloriously on Tabor" (Hall). It is not implied that it took the prophet the whole of this time to reach Horeb, which is only distant from Beer-sheba some 130 miles. "There are eleven days' journey <span class="accented">from</span> Horeb, by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnes" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-2.htm">Deuteronomy 1:2</a>).

It is perhaps worth remembering that a part of the desert, though at some distance from Horeb; boars at this day the name of <span class="accented">Magharah</span>, or cave. But there is a "narrow fret" pointed out by tradition as the abode of Elijah, on the side of Jebol Muss. "There is nothing to confirm, but there is nothing to contradict, the belief that it may have been in that secluded basin, which has long been pointed out as the spot No scene could be more suitable for the vision which follows" (Stanley). There is, however, one formidable difficulty in the way of this identification, viz., that the cave is only just large enough for a man's body, which does not agree with ver. 18], <span class="cmt_word">and lodged</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> means strictly to <span class="accented">pass the night</span>.

The former asks how it comes to pass that the angel, instead of reproving him, succoured and strengthened him (vers. 6, 7), if he was acting in faithlessness or disobedience. But surely it does not follow that God denies all grace and sustenance to His elect servants even if they do, in a moment of despair, forget or distrust Him. Elijah may have been strengthened for this very journey, Because God would meet with him and teach him the lessons of patience and trust he needed to learn, at the "mount of God" itself. And his answer, especially when contrasted with that of ver. 14 (where see note), certainly betrays, not only irritation and despair, but a "carnal zeal which would gladly have called down the vengeance of the Almighty upon all idolaters" (Keil). The question in itself, it is true, does not necessarily impart censure - it might merely mean, "What wouldst thou learn of me?" But when it is remembered that the prophet had been <span class="accented">sent</span> to every other destination by the "word of the Lord," and that he had left Jezreel without any such word - left it in terror and bitter disappointment and sheer distrust of God - it does look as if the words conveyed a gentle reminder that he had deserted the post of duty, and had no right to be there.

But we must take into account the deep despondency with which Elijah spoke, and remember the correction which his words received (ver. 18)]; <span class="cmt_word">they seek my life, to take it away.</span> [The commentators are hopelessly divided as to the spirit and temper with which these words were spoken. Bahr, as before, is very positive that there is no complaint or murmuring against God on Elijah's part. He contends that the prophet has been led to Sinai simply by the earnest longing for a disclosure concerning the dealings of God, and for instructions as to his future conduct; and this view has the support of other weighty authorities. But it is extremely difficult to resist the conclusion that we have here at the least a "tacit reproof that God had looked on so quietly for such a length of time, and had suffered things to come to such an extremity" (Keil).  St. Paul speaks of him as pleading with God <span class="accented">against Israel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f74;&#x3bb;</span>. <a href="../../par/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>), said certainly represents the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> he received as a connection. And the idea which this verse, taken in connexion with the prophet's flight (ver. 3) and his prayer (ver. 4), leaves on the unbiassed mind certainly is that in his zeal for God he resented not only the growing corruption of the age, but above all the frustration of his efforts to stay it. What burdened and vexed his righteous soul was that in the very hour of victory, when the people had confessed that Jehovah alone was God, he, the one solitary witness for the truth, should be driven from his post to escape as best he might, and to leave the covenant people to the baneful influence of Jezebel and her army of false prophets. It is the cry which we hear over and over again in the Old Testament, the complaint of the silence and apparent indifference of God, of the persecution of the righteous, and the impunity of evil doers.]

Very similar expression <a href="../../par/job/4-16.htm">Job 4:16</a>. What was the object and meaning of this succession of signs? First, let us remember that Elijah was the prophet of deeds. He taught his contemporaries not by word but by act. He is here taught in turn by signs. There passes before him in the mountain hollow, in the black and dark night, a procession of natural terrors-of storm, and earthquake, and fire. But none of these things move him; none speak to his soul and tell of a present God. It is the hushed voice, the awful stillness, overpowers and enchains him. He is to learn hence, first, that the Lord is a God "merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>); and secondly, that as it has been with himself, so it will be with others; the name of the Lord will be proclaimed in a voice of gentle silence (<span class="accented">ib</span>.<span class="accented">, ver</span>. 5). The weapons of His warfare, the instruments of religious progress, must be spiritual, not carnal. Not in fire and sword and slaughter, but by a secret voice speaking to the conscience, will God regain His sway over the hearts of Israel. (See Homiletics.) The striking  similarity between this theophany and that which Moses saw in the same place, or at no great distance from it, must not be overlooked, for this constitutes another link between law giver and law restorer. The proclamation of <a href="../../par/exodus/34-3.htm">Exodus 34:3, 7</a> is the best exponent of the parable of vers. 11, 12. To each was the vision of God granted after a faithful witness against idolatry, and after a slaughter of idolaters; each was in a clift of the rock; in either case the Lord <span class="accented">passed by</span>; the one was taught by words, the other rather by signs, but the message in each case was the same - that judgment is God's strange work, but that He will by no means clear the guilty (cf. ver. 17).]

It was the still small voice, apparently, that first brought him to obey the command there given. He would perhaps be afraid to issue from the shelter of his cave during the tempest and the earthquake, which may have followed directly after the instruction to go forth was given. Possibly there was a lesson for him here also, viz., that amid the din and excitement and torture of drought and famine and fire and blood the commands of God are less likely to be heard in the soul and obeyed, than in the hour of peace and stillness. The drought and famine and sword have their work to do, even as the tempest and the earthquake have theirs; but it is by the voice of mercy and love that the hearts of men are turned back again. "Not in the strong east wind that parted the Red Sea, or the fire that swept the top of Sinai, or the earthquake that shook down the walls of Jericho would God be brought so near to man as in the still small voice of the child of Bethlehem" (Stanley)] <span class="cmt_word">in the entering in of the cave.</span> [He hardly obeyed the letter of the command of ver. 11 even then.

What are we to understand from this repetition of the former answer? Has the lesson of this theophany been lost upon him? Has he failed to grasp its significance? It is probable that he only partially understood its meaning, and it certainly looks as if he still felt himself an injured and disappointed man; as if the recollection of the way in which his work had been frustrated still rankled in his soul. But though the words are the same, it <span class="cmt_word">is</span> possible, and indeed probable, that the <span class="accented">tone</span> was entirely different; that instead of speaking, as he had spoken before, querulously and almost defiantly, he now, catching his inspiration from the still small voice, speaks with bated breath and profound self humiliation. The facts are the same. He repeats them, because they and they alone explain why he is there, and because he cannot see as yet how they are to be remedied. But he is now conscious of a misgiving as to the wisdom and piety of his course. He feels he has acted hastily and faithlessly, and has wanted to do God's work in his own rough way. He will go back, if it be God's will; he will be content to wait God's time, and to follow His leading. The commission which is straightway given him almost proves that he had experienced a change. It implies that he is now fitted for his high ministry.]

This cannot mean "through the desert to Damascus," for he could not possibly go any other way, nor yet "to the desert (through which he had just come) to Damascus," for he was then in the heart of the desert. He was to find a hiding place - we find the king of Damascus at war with Ahab, ch. 20. - or possibly a sphere for work, - he would be near Hazael - in the rugged desert which stretches south and east of the Syrian capital. (See Stanley, "Sinai and Palestine," p. 410; Porter's "Five Years in Damascus," vol. 2. p. 254 sqq.) Here, too, the prophet would be at no great distance from his own country. See on 1 Kings 17:3]: and  <span class="cmt_word">Wheel thou comest, anoint</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and thou shalt come and anoint</span>. LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The A.V. increases the difficulty. In the Hebrew the <span class="accented">time</span> of the anointing is indefinite. This commission has long been a <span class="accented">crux interpretum</span>. For neither Hazael, nor Jehu, nor Elisha, so far as we have any record, was ever <span class="accented">anointed</span> by Elijah. Elisha was <span class="accented">called</span> by him to the prophetic office. Hazael, it is barely possible, may have been anointed secretly, like David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-2.htm">1 Samuel 16:2, 13</a>), but all that we gather from Scripture is, that he was called in an indirect way, and certainly not anointed, by Elisha (<a href="../../par/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-15</a>). Jehu was certainly anointed, but it was neither by Elisha nor Elijah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1, 6</a>), but by one of the sons of the prophets. All we can say, consequently, is that the command was obeyed <span class="accented">in the spirit</span>, and no doubt in the best possible time and way. There may have been good reasons, of which we know nothing, why Elijah should devolve the appointment of the two kings upon his successor, and we can readily understand that the word "<span class="accented">anoint"</span> was, as in <a href="../../par/judges/9-8.htm">Judges 9:8</a>, <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, never meant to be construed literally. For in the first place, we have no record elsewhere of the anointing of any <span class="accented">prophet</span>; and secondly, it is remarkable that when Elijah might so easily have anointed Elisha, he did nothing of the kind. It is clear, therefore, that he understood the word to mean "appoint." And the root idea of anointing, it must be remembered, was the <span class="accented">setting apart</span> for the service of God (<a href="../../par/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a>). Hence it was (Bahr) that vessels (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a> sqq.), and even stones (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>), were anointed. And when we find that these three persons were set apart sooner or later, and in different ways, to fulfil the high purposes of God, that ought to suffice us. The author of this history clearly found no difficulty in reconciling this account and that of <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-9.htm">2 Kings 8:9</a>. It has also been objected to this charge (Rawlinson) that it is no "<span class="accented">explanation</span> or application of the preceding parable." But this is precisely what it appears to have been intended to be. The prophet is here taught by word much the same lesson that had been conveyed by signs, in the preceding vision. No doubt there are additional particulars - the vision dealt only with principles, the charge descends to details and prescribes duties - but still the great lesson that souls are to be won, that God's kingdom is to be advanced, not by wrath and vengeance, by fire and sword, but by meekness and gentleness, through the reason and the conscience, is proclaimed. Hazael and Jehu, each was God's instrument to punish; each was like the sweeping siena or the devouring fire, each was an engine of destruction; but by neither of these were the hearts Of men turned to the Lord. It was the sword of Elisha, the sword of his mouth (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/49-2.htm">Isaiah 49:2</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-16.htm">Revelation 2:16</a>), should constrain men to hide their faces and humble themselves before God] <span class="cmt_word">Hazael</span> [the <span class="accented">seer of God</span>.

Not only are vers. 16, 17 an interpretation, in some sort, of the vision, but they are an answer to Elijah's complaint (vers. 10, 14).

Indeed, it would have been strange if there had been. A greater readiness to obey the prophetic summons, Elisha could not well have showed. Forthwith, as soon as he realized his call, "he left the oxen and ran after" his newmaster. True, he asks permission - and why should he not? for "grace is no enemy to good nature" - to give a parting embrace to the father and mother to whom he owed his life, and whom he had been required by God to honour.

Horses were such natural and familiar tokens of royal state (not being employed in agriculture or for travelling), that the Hebrew kings were warned (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>) against multiplying them. Outrunners again, such as the Roman emperors had (called by them <span class="accented">cursores</span>), and such as we find at the present day in Egypt, <span class="accented">footmen</span> who precede the chariot at full speed, and by their shrill cries clear the way, are admirably calculated to impress the public mind.

It is also highly probable that Adonijah's ambitious character was much more to his liking than that of the pious and pacific Solomon.

Is it not highly probable that among the "words" Adonijah had with him was a promise to restore the priesthood to his family exclusively, as the reward of his allegiance]: <span class="cmt_word">and they following Adonijah helped him</span> (lit., as marg., "helped after Adonijah." It is a pregnant construction, "they aided having followed the side of Adonijah" (Gesenius). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which <i>belonged</i> to David, were not with Adonijah.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Zadok the priest</span> [<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>. It is generally said to be difficult to explain "how Zadok and Abiathar came  both to be "priests at this time." Rawlinson, who adds that "the best explanation is that Abiathar was the real high priest," officiating in Zion, while Zadok acted as chief priest at the tabernacle at Gibeon. (Bahr, by a strange oversight, assigns to Zadok the care of the ark on Mount Zion, whereas <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>, distinctly connects his ministry with the tabernacle of witness at Gibeon.) But the precedence (see on ver. 7) generally assigned to Zadok is hardly consistent with the idea that Abiathar was "the real high priest." The fact is that a duality of high priests, associated, apparently, on pretty equal terms, was not unknown in Jewish history. The cases of Eleazer and Ithamar, Hophni and Phinehas, Annas and Caiaphas, will occur to all. <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18</a>, speaks of "the chief priest" and "the second priest;" <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10</a>, of the "chief priest of the house of Zadok." And a dual priesthood would be the more necessary in David's days, because of the two sanctuaries, Zion and Gibeon. We find, however, from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11</a>, that Zadok was already priest at the time of the bringing up of the ark. And the true explanation, no doubt, is that Zadok had succeeded some member of his family, in all probability Jehoiada, called in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/12-27.htm">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>, "the leader of Aaron" (Hebrews), who had certainly been high priest in the time of Saul (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>), and who would hardly be degraded when, with 3700 followers, he joined David at Hebron. On his decease, or cession of orifice, Zadok, who had joined at the same time with a large contingent,was associated with Abiathar in the priest's office. This dual arrangement, consequently, was the result of David's having taken over a high priest from Saul, together with the kingdom, when he had Abiathar as priest already,] <span class="cmt_word">and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Jehoiada the high priest (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/27-5.htm">1 Chronicles 27:5</a>).

By many indeed the present <span class="accented">Birket-es-Sultan</span> is identified with the Lower Pool of Gihon. But others (Ferguson, Rawlinson, etc.) see in it the ancient name of the Tyropaeon. Scripture does not speak of it as a <span class="accented">spring</span>, though the "source of the waters of Gihon" is mentioned <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>, Hebrews The text shows that it was <span class="accented">below</span> the city ("bring him <span class="accented">down</span> upon Gihon," ver. 33. Cf. also ver. 40). <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-14.htm">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>, speaks of "Gihon in the valley," where it is very noticeable that the word used is <span class="accented">Nachal</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Wady, watercourse).

Bible," art. Gihon). It is also to be noticed that the text last cited mentions Gihon in connection with Ophel, which lies southeast of Jerusalem.. The Chald., Arab., and Syr. are probably right, therefore, in identifying Gihon here with <span class="accented">Siloam</span> (which lies at the foot of Ophel), in favour of which it may further be said that it would be admirably suited for David's purpose - of a counter demonstration - and that whether En-Rogel is to be found at the Well of the Virgin or the Well of Job. Siloam is at no great distance from either, and quite within earshot, whereas the traditional Gihon is altogether out of the way. It must be borne in mind that this procession to and from Gihon was ordained, not because there was any special reason for anointing Solomon there ? for it was not a holy place - but purely as a demonstration to the populace, and to checkmate the conspirators. It was probably a public place, and would accommodate a large concourse (Poole).

But while their functions are pretty well understood, great difference of opinion exists as to the origin or meaning of the words. By some they are supposed to be <span class="accented">Gentile</span> names. A tribe of Cherethites is mentioned <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>. (Cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>), and in close connexion with the Philistines (ver. 16). Hence Cherethite has been thought to be another name for Philistine; and as the LXX. and Syr. render the word "Cretans," it has been conjectured that the Philistines had their origin from Crete. They did come from Caphtor, and that is probably Crete (see <a href="../../par/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> again, is not unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> In favor of this view is the fact that David certainly had a bodyguard of foreign mercenaries (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>, where the "Gittites" are connected with the Cherethites). Nor does it make against it that "two designations" would thus "be employed side by side for one and the same people" - as if we should speak of Britons and Englishmen (Bahr). For the names look like a <span class="accented">paronomasia</span> - of which the Jews were very fond - and a trick of this kind would at once account for the tautology. [Since writing this, I find the same idea has already occurred to Ewald.] But the other view, adopted by Gesenius, is that the names are names of office and function. Cherethite he would derive from <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5db;</span>, cut, slay; and by Cherethites he would understand "executioners," which the royal bodyguard were in ancient despotisms (<a href="../../par/genesis/39-1.htm">Genesis 39:1, Hebrews</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-14.htm">Daniel 2:14</a>, etc. See on 1 Kings 2:25).

"A king who has been probably identified with this Ben-hadad brought into the field against Assyria nearly 4000 chariots" (Rawlinson)]: <span class="cmt_word">and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it</span>. [The object of this expedition was clearly to humble and to plunder the kingdom of Samaria.

When we consider how jealously the seraglio of an Eastern prince is guarded, and how the surrender of the harem is a virtual surrender of the throne (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21, 22</a>; note on 1 Kings 2:22), and certainly a surrender of all manhood and self-respect, we see that his aim was to wound Ahab in his tenderest point, to humble him to the lowest depths of degradation, and possibly to <span class="accented">force</span> a quarrel upon him], <span class="cmt_word">even the goodliest</span> [The LXX. omits this.

Rawlinson would explain this excessive demand of the Syrian king by the assumption that when it was made the siege had already lasted a long time, and that the people were now reduced to the greatest straits, circumstances which the historian, with the characteristic brevity of the sacred writers, omits to mention. But really no such supposition is needed. The overwhelming force which Ben-hadad had at his back would, in his eyes, justify any demands. <span class="accented">And the prima facie</span> view of ver. 2 is that the messengers were sent on the first approach of the army, or rather at the beginning of the siege.]

All that is certain is that he judged it wise, in the presence of the enormous force arrayed against him, to make every possible concession, to adopt the most subservient tone, and to cringe at the feet of Ben-hadad. But all the time he may have hoped that his soft answer would turn away wrath. It is very far from certain that had Ben-hadad sent to demand the wives and children which Ahab here seems willing to yield to him they would have been sent. When Ben-hadad threatens (ver. 6) a measure which involved much less indignity than the surrender of the entire seraglio to his lusts, Ahab stands at bay. Allowance must be made for the exaggerations of Eastern courtesy. The writer was entertained in 1861 by Jacob esh Shellabi, then sheykh of the Samaritans, who repeatedly used words very similar to these. "This  house is yours," he would say; never meaning, however, that he should be taken at his word.]

[If Ahab ever hoped by his abject submission to conciliate the Syrian king, he now finds that his words have had just the opposite effect. For all that the latter concluded from it was that Ahab was one upon whom he might trample at pleasure, and this servility encouraged Ben-hadad to renew his demands in a still more galling and vexatious form. This second message discloses to us still more plainly the royal bully and braggart, and shows us what the "comity of nations" in the old world was often like.]

Ben-bahad vows that he will make Samaria a heap of dust, and at the same time affirms that so overwhelming is his host, that this dust will be insufficient to fill the hands of his soldiers.

We have here surely an exaggeration, even more obvious than that of ver. 39. For even if we suppose an earthquake, it is difficult to believe that the walls of a place like  Aphek could bury so large a number in their ruins. Rawlinson suggests that the Syrians at the time were "manning the defences in full force," and that the earthquake "threw down the wall where they were most thickly crowded upon it;" but the question arises whether it is possible to mass 27,000 men upon any part of a wall, or all the walls, especially of an ancient village fortress. Thenius hints that the fall of the wall may have been occasioned by the Israelites undermining it during the night, but it seems hardly likely that so small a force could undertake operations of that kind against so formidable a body of troops. Keil objects to this view on another ground, viz., that its object is to negative the idea of a Divine interposition. But the text does not ascribe the fall of the wall to any such interposition, and we know that the sacred writers are not slow to recognize the finger of God whenever it is exerted.] And Ben-hadad fled, and came into [Heb. <span class="accented">to</span>] the city [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, Aphek.

Another <span class="accented">prophet is</span> implied. It was because this "neighbour" was a prophet that his disregard of the word of the Lord was so sinful, and received such severe punishment], <span class="cmt_word">in the word of the Lord</span> [see on 1 Kings 13:1], <span class="cmt_word">Smite me, I pray thee.</span> [Why the prophet, in order to the accomplishment of his mission - which was to obtain from Ahab's own lips a confession of his deserts - why he should have been smitten, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, bruised and wounded, is not quite clear. For it is obvious that he might have sustained his part, told his story, and obtained a judgment from the king, without proceeding to such painful extremities. It is quite true that a person thus wounded would perhaps sustain the part of one who had been in battle <span class="accented">better</span>, but the wounds were in no way necessary to his disguise, and men do not court pain without imperious reasons. Besides, it was "in the word of the Lord" that these wounds were sought and received. It is quite clear, therefore, that it cannot have been merely to give him a claim to an audience with the king (Ewald) - he could easily have simulated wounds by means of bandages, which would at the same time have helped to disguise him - or that he might foreshadow in his own person the wounding which Ahab would receive (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), for of that he says nothing, or for any similar reason. The wounding, we may be quite sure, and the tragical circumstances connected therewith, are essential parts of the parable this prophet had to act, of the lesson he had to teach. 1%w the great lesson he had to convey, not to the king alone, but to the prophetic order and to the whole country, the lesson most necessary in that lawless age, was that of implicit unquestioning obedience to the Divine law. Ahab had just transgressed that law. He had "let go a man whom God had appointed to utter destruction;" he had heaped honours on the oppressor of his country, and in gratifying benevolent impulses had ignored the will and counsel of God (see on ver. 42). No doubt it seemed to him, as it has seemed to others since, that he had acted with rare magnanimity, and that his generosity in that age, an age which showed no mercy to the fallen, was unexampled. But he must be taught that he has no right to be generous at the expense of others; that God's will must be done even when it goes against the grain, when it contradicts impulses of kindness, and demands painful sacrifices. He is taught this by the prophetic word (ver. 42), but much more effectively by the actions which preceded it. A prophet required to smite a brother prophet, and that for no apparent reason, would no doubt find it repugnant to his feelings to do so; it would seem to him hard and cruel and shameful to smite a companion. But the prophet who refused to do this, who followed his benevolent impulses in preference to the word of the Lord, died for his sin - died  forthwith by the visitation of God. What a lesson was this to king and country - for no doubt the incident would be bruited abroad, and the very strangeness of the whole proceeding would heighten the impression it made. Indeed, it is hardly possible to conceive a way in which the duty of unquestioning obedience could be more emphatically taught. When this prophet appeared before the king, a man had smitten and wounded him, disagreeable and painful as the task must have been, because of the word of the Lord; whilst a brother prophet, who declined the office because it was painful, had been slain by a wild beast. It is easy to see that there was here a solemn lesson for the king, and that the wounding gave it its edge.] <span class="cmt_word">And the man refused to smite him.</span>

In fact, the two histories run on almost parallel lines. In each case it is a prophet who disobeys, and disobeys the "word of the Lord;" in each case the disobedience appears almost excusable; in each case the prophet appears to be hardly dealt with, and suffers instant punishment, whilst the king escapes; in each case the punishment is foretold by a prophet; in each case it is effected by the instrumentality of a lion. And in each case the lesson is the same - that God's commands must be kept, whatever the cost, or that stern retribution will inevitably follow.]

It was probably because of this denunciation (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>) that Josephus identifies this prophet with Micaiah, the son of Imlah, "whom Ahab appears to have imprisoned on account of some threatening prophecy (Rawlinson). See <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-9.htm">1 Kings 22:9, 26</a>. For the fulfilment o! this prediction see ch. 22. It has seemed to some writers as if Ahab were here very hardly dealt with for merely gratifying s generous impulse, and dealing magnanimously with a conquered foe. Indeed, there are commentators who see in his release of the cruel and insolent tyrant s "trait which does honour to the heart of Ahab." But it is to be remembered, first, that Ahab was not free to do as he liked in this matter. His victories had been won, not by his prowess, by the skill of his generals, or the valour of his soldiers, but by the power of God alone. The war, that is to say, was God's war: it was begun and continued, and should therefore have been ended, in Him. When even the details of the attack had been ordered of God (ver. 14), surely He should have been consulted as to the disposal of the prisoners. The prophet who promised Divine aid might at any rate have been asked - as prophets constantly were in that age (<a href="../../par/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5, 8</a>) - what was the "word of the Lord" concerning Israel's overbearing and inveterate enemy. But Ahab, who had himself played so craven a part (vers. 21, 31), and who had contributed nothing to these great and unhoped-for victories, nevertheless arrogated to himself their fruits, and thereby ignored and dishonoured God. Secondly, if he had so little regard for his own private interests as to liberate such a man as Ben-hadad, he ought, as trustee for the peace and welfare of Israel, to have acted differently. The demand of ver. 6 should have revealed to him the character of the man he had to deal with. And lastly, he was acting in defiance of all the principles and precedents of the Old Testament dispensation. For one great principle of that dispensation was the <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>. The king was the authorized dispenser of rewards and punishments, not only to wicked subjects but to aggressive nations. It was his duty to mete out to them the measure they had served to Israel. And the precedents were all in favour of putting such wretches as this Ben-hadad to the sword (<a href="../../par/joshua/10-26.htm">Joshua 10:26</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-25.htm">Judges 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>). If he had been the first oppressor who fell into the hands of Israel, Ahab might have had some excuse. But with the fate of Agog, of Adonibezek, of Oreb and Zeeb, in his memory, he ought at any rate to have paused and asked counsel of God before taking Ben-hadad into his chariot and sending him away with a covenant of peace, to reappear at no distant period on the scene as the scourge of the Lord's people.]

And the following considerations will show that the discrepancy is only apparent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The sentence here pronounced against Ahab was, on his repentance, stayed in its execution. God said distinctly, "I will not bring the evil in his days," and as distinctly added that He would "bring the evil in his <span class="accented">son's days, upon his house"</span> (ver. 29).

The repentance of Ahab, having secured him immunity from this sentence, his subsequent folly and sin (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-27.htm">1 Kings 22:27</a>) nevertheless brought down upon him a judgment of God strikingly similar, as we might expect it would be, to that originally denounced against him, which was now reserved for his son. In ether words, the prophecy was fulfilled to the letter in the person of his son, but it had a secondary fulfilment in its spirit on himself].

The idea is clearly derived from the institutions of slavery, according to which the bondservant was wholly at his master's disposal and was  bound to accomplish his will.

It was because Ahab was the representative of God, God's minister of justice, etc. If he had not himself devised the death of Naboth; if he had, which is possible, remained in ignorance of the means by which Jezebel proposed to procure him the vineyard, he had nevertheless readily and gladly acquiesced in her infamous crime after its accomplishment, and was then reaping its fruits. And because he was the king, the judge, who, instead of punishing the evil doer, sanctioned and approved the deed, and who crowned a reign of idolatries and abominations with this shameful murder, the prophetic sentence is directed primarily against him.]

It is in favour of this view that Ahab entertained him and his large retinue with such profuse hospitality.

Probably Ben-hadad, when he besieged Samaria (<a href="../../par/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>), had formed the idea of reducing the whole of Palestine to subjection. And Jehoshaphat would remember that Ramoth-Gilead, where the Syrian king was still  entrenched, was but forty miles distant from Jerusalem. Bahr holds that horses are specially mentioned "because they formed an essential part of the military power" (<a href="../../par/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>). It is true that in a campaign against the Syrians they would be especially useful (see on 1 Kings 20:1.); but they receive no mention at the hands of the chronicler, who reads instead of this last clause, "And we (or I) will be with thee in the war."]

The only conclusion open to us, consequently - and it is now generally adopted - is that they were the priests of the high places of Bethel and Dan, the successors of those whom Jeroboam had introduced into the priestly office.

"No ancient people considered any cultus complete without a class of men through whom the god might be questioned" (Bahr). The existence of so large a number of prophets of the calves proves that the inroads of idolatry had by no means destroyed the calf worship.

The question was insincere; the reply was ironical (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>). Ahab is answered "according to the multitude of his idols" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-4.htm">Ezekiel 14:4</a>). He wishes to be deceived, and he is deceived. No doubt Micaiah's mocking tone showed that his words were ironical; but Ahab's hollow tone had already proved to Micaiah that he was insincere; that he did not care to know the will of the Lord, and wanted prophets who would speak to him smooth things and prophesy deceits (<a href="../../par/isaiah/30-10.htm">Isaiah 30:10</a>).]

This may be an "empty Rabbinical tradition" (Bahr), but we may be sure that Ahab did not hear Micaiah's words unmoved.

We can hardly doubt that Jehoshaphat at least would have been well content to abandon the expedition. After the solicitude he had manifested for the sanction of one of the prophets of Jehovah, and after that the one who had been consulted had predicted the defeat of the army, the king of Judah must have had re,my misgivings. But it is not difficult to understand why, notwithstanding his fears, he did not draw back. For, in the first place, he had committed himself to the war by the rash and positive promise of ver. 4. In the next place, he was Ahab's guest, and had been sumptuously entertained by him, and it would therefore require some moral courage to extricate himself from the toils in which he was entangled. Moreover he would have subjected himself to the imputation of cowardice had he deserted his ally because of a prophecy which threatened the latter with death. The people around him, again, including perhaps his own retinue, were possessed with the spirit of battle, and treated the prophecy of Micaiah with contempt, and it would be difficult for him to swim alone against the current. It is probable, too, that he discounted the portentous words of Micaiah on account of the long. standing quarrel between him and Ahab. And, finally, we must remember that his own interests were threatened by Syria, and he may well have feared trouble from that quarter in case this war were abandoned. Rawlinson suggests that he may have conceived a personal affection for Ahab; but <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a> affords but slender ground for this conclusion.]

It is enough to remember that Micaiah's words, "these have no master," could not fail to awaken come alarm in his bosom, especially when connected with the prophecy of <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-42.htm">1 Kings 20:42</a>. He will not betray his fear by keeping out of the fray - which, indeed, he could not do without abdicating one of the principal functions of the king (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), and without exposing himself to the charge of cowardice; but under the circumstances he thinks it imprudent to take the lead of the army, as kings were wont to do (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>), in his royal robes.

If this LXX. interpretation could be maintained it would lend some colour to the supposition, otherwise destitute of basis, that Ahab by this arrangement was plotting the death of Jehoshaphat in order that he might incorporate Judah into his own kingdom. It is clear, however, that Ahab then had other work on his hands,  and it is doubtful whether even he was capable of such a pitch of villainy. What he means is, either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Syrians have a personal enmity against himself (ver. 81), whereas they could have none against the king of Judah; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that Jehoshaphat's life had not been threatened as his own had.

But it is impossible to see in Ahab's generous conduct towards him a sufficient reason for the fierce hatred which these words disclose. It is much more probable that some affront had subsequently been offered to the Syrian monarch, possibly in the shape of the reproaches which Ahab may have addressed to him on account of his retention of Ramoth-Gilead, and the gross violation of the treaty of <a href="../../par/1_kings/20-34.htm">1 Kings 20:34</a>.

That it was a cry for Divine help is the most probable, because it is almost an instinct, especially with a pious soul like Jehoshaphat, to cry to God in the moment of danger. That he had doubts as to whether the course he was pursuing was pleasing to God, would make him all the more ready to cry aloud for mercy the moment he found himself in peril.

His back was not turned to them, as he had desired. The idea that he was in any way fighting against the Syrians is altogether foreign to the text. It is at first sight somewhat difficult to reconcile this statement with the direction given to the charioteer in the preceding verse, and some have been led, though without sufficient warrant, to conclude that Ahab left the field, had he wound bound up, and then returned to take his part in the battle. But the explanation is very simple. As the battle increased, it became impossible to comply with the king's desire. So thick was the fight that retreat was impossible. Hence the wounded king, who would otherwise have sunk down to the bottom of the chariot, had to be "stayed up in the presence of the Syrians." This circumstance may also account for the fact that he died at even. Had it been possible to remove him and staunch his wounds, he might have lingered for some time. As it was, he bled to death. It is not clear, therefore, that "his death was kingly" (Kitto), or that we must concede to Ahab "the credit of right princely fortitude on this occasion" (Rawlinson). He would have left the host could he have done so. It was his set-rants propped up the dying man in his chariot, to encourage the army.

It is not necessary to  suppose, as Canon Rawlinson does ("Speaker's Com.," vol. 2 p. 489), that in the words, "show thyself a man," we have a reference to Solomon's <span class="accented">youth</span>; for words precisely similar were addressed to each other by the Philistines at Aphek (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9</a>). The age of Solomon at his accession is very doubtful. David said, "Solomon my son is young and tender" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-5.htm">1 Chronicles 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>); and Solomon says of himself, "I am a little child" <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>). Josephus, probably reflecting the tradition of his time, fixes his age at fourteen; Eupolemus at twelve. I incline to think that the words "young and tender" almost forbid the favourite opinion that he was about twenty.]

"The context evidently requires 'prosper' here, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>" (Rawlinson). "That thou mayest...  <span class="accented">do wisely"</span> is a very lame and impotent conclusion to ver. 3. We have here an evident reminiscence of <a href="../../par/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>; possibly also of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-9.htm">Deuteronomy 29:9</a>.

In the promise of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>. there is no mention of any stipulations, <span class="accented">"If</span> thy children," etc. But both here and in Psalm 122:12, and in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-25.htm">1 Kings 8:25</a>, special prominence is given to the <span class="accented">condition</span> (<span class="accented">dum se bene gesserint</span>), which no doubt was understood, if not expressed, when the promise was first made], saying, <span class="cmt_word">If thy children take</span> <span class="cmt_word">heed to</span> [lit., "keep," same word as in vers. 2, 3] <span class="cmt_word">their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee</span> [lit., "be cut off to thee," as marg.

It had been his duty as king, as the power ordained of God, to visit all violations of the law of God with their appropriate penalties; and this duty, in some instances at least, had been neglected. For the law of Moses, reaffirming the primaeval law which formed part of the so called "precepts of Noah" (<a href="../../par/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>) - that ix. blood must be expiated by blood - enjoined, with singular emphasis and distinctness, the death of the murderer (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16, 17, 18, 19, 30-33</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>). It declared that so long as murder remained unpunished, the whole land was defiled and under a curse (<a href="../../par/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). And it gave the king no power to pardon, no discretion in the matter. Until the red stain of blood was washed out "by the blood of him that shed it" the Divine Justice was not satisfied, and a famine or pestilence or sword might smite the land. Now, David knew all this: he could not fail to know it, for he had seen his country, a few years before, visited by a famine because of the  unavenged blood of the Gibeonites (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1</a>). And yet, one notorious and infamous murderer had not been put to death. The assassin of Abner and of Amasa still polluted the earth, still occupied a distinguished position, and defied punishment. But if the law of Moses was to be kept, then, whatever it might cost, and however painful it might be (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>), he must die; and David, for the welfare of his kingdom, the stability of his throne, and above all, the honour of God, must require his death. No doubt it had often burdened his mind, especially during these last days of feebleness, the thought that punishment had been so long delayed; and therefore, as he sees the end approaching, he feels that he must enjoin upon his successor the fulfilment of that duty which he had been too "weak" to discharge (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>). Hence he proceeds,

But this is just what David did not do; for he is careful to <span class="accented">exclude</span> all mention of his private wrongs. It is true, he says, "what Job did to me," but that is because "the sovereign is smitten in the subject" (Bp. Hall), and because the first of these murders had caused David to be suspected of complicity, while each had deprived him of an able officer. And the words that follow] <span class="cmt_word">what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel</span> [these words are clearly explicative of the "what he did to me."

In 2 Samuel 27:24, Ithra is called "an Israelite," an obvious mistake for "Ishmaelite," as indeed it stands in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>. Amasa's mother, Abigail, was sister of David and Zeruiah; Amasa, consequently, was Joab's first cousin. This murder was even fouler than that of Abner.

These are, usual (hardly "principal," as Keil) articles of Eastern dress, of the civilian's as well as of the soldier's, and these two are mentioned because, no doubt, the horrible details of the two murders, and especially of the last (see <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-8.htm">2 Samuel 20:8</a>), had been reported to David. He had been told at the time how the blood of Amasa had spurted on to the girdle of Joab, and streamed down into his sandals, and these details, which no doubt made a deep impression upon his mind, are recited here to show how dastardly and treacherous was the deed, and how thoroughly Joab was stained with innocent blood, blood which cried to heaven for vengeance (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>)].

It needed great discretion in exacting the punishment of death in the case of one who was so powerful, who had such influence with the army and the people, whose crimes had been passed over for so long a time, to whom David was so much indebted - Joab had partly won and had twice preserved for him his crown - and to whom he was allied by ties of blood.

This expression, no doubt, looks vindictive, but that is solely because  we forget the character of the Old Testament dispensation (as one of <span class="accented">temporal</span> rewards and punishments. See the "Expositor," vol. 3. p. 114), the position of David as king (as the authorized dispenser of punishments, and as responsible to God for dispensing them without fear or favour), and the principles of the Mosaic code (as a <span class="accented">lex talionis</span>, demanding blood for blood, and requiring the magistrates and people to purge themselves of the guilt of blood by demanding "the blood of him that shed it"). Let these considerations be borne in mind, and there is absolutely no warrant for charging David with malevolence. Wordsworth lays stress on the fact that Joab had not repented of his crimes. But we need have recourse to no such suppositions. The Jewish law afforded no place of repentance to the murderer. No amount of contrition would cleanse the land of blood. The <span class="accented">temporal</span> penalty must be paid.

He remembers that the sin of Shimei, which was nothing else than treason and blasphemy, has so far escaped punishment. In a moment of generous enthusiasm, he had included Shimei in the general amnesty which he proclaimed on his return (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>). He had thought, no doubt, at the time only of the offence against himself; he had forgotten his sacred and representative character as "the Lord's anointed;" or if he had remembered it (ver. 21) the emotions of that memorable day had obscured or perverted his sense of justice and duty. But he has since realized - and the thought weighs upon his conscience in the chamber of death - that he then pardoned what he had no power to pardon, viz., a sin to which the Mosaic law attached the penalty of death. For blasphemy, as for murder, there was no expiation short of the death of the blasphemer (<a href="../../par/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14-16</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10, 13</a>); and blasphemy, like murder, though not perhaps to the same extent, involved those who heard it in its guilt, until they had discharged themselves of their sin upon the head of the guilty (<a href="../../par/leviticus/14-14.htm">Leviticus 14:14</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). But Shimei, so far from having suffered the penalty of the law, had been twice protected against it; twice preserved alive, in defiance of law, by the supreme magistrate, the executor of law. And David, who has been charging his son to keep the law, now realizes that he himself has been a law breaker. He has kept his oath, sworn to his own or his people's hurt, and he will keep it to the end. But Solomon is under no such obligation. <span class="accented">He</span> can demand the long arrears of justice, none the less due because of the time that has elapsed and the royal <span class="accented">laches</span>  (<span class="accented">"nullum tempus occurrit regi"</span>); he can deal with the blasphemer as the law directs, and this David now charges him to do.

Keil gathers from this word that Shimei "was living at that time in Jerusalem," and refers to ver. 36, which, if anything, implies that he was not. But it is worth suggesting whether Shimei may not be the Shimei to whom reference is made in <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>. (Dean Stanley notices this as a possibility, but alleges nothing in support of it: "Jewish Church," vol. 2 p. 171, note.) We there find Shimei and Rei mentioned as firm adherents of Solomon at the time of Adonijah's rising, and in these words, they "were not <span class="accented">with Adonijah."</span> Surely it is not an unfair presumption - if there is nothing to rebut it - that the Shimei subsequently mentioned as "with" Solomon is the same person. But it has been objected (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, by Kitto) that the false part that Shimei played at the time of Absalom's revolt would have forever prevented his being recognized and mentioned as one of Solomon's supporters. I very much doubt it. The great influence which Shimei possessed must be taken into account. Nothing shows that influence more clearly than the fact that on the day of David's restoration, despite the part he had taken, and the possible disgrace and danger that awaited him, he could still command the attendance of one thousand men of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-17.htm">2 Samuel 19:17</a>). Probably the secret of his influence lay in the fact that he was "of the family of the house of Saul," and possibly, owing to the insignificance of Saul's descendants, was the mainstay and chief representative of that house. And if so, there is nothing at all surprising in the mention of the fact that he was "not with Adonijah," and was subsequently "with" Solomon. It may have been a matter of great consequence at that critical time, which side Shimei - and the thousand or more Benjamites at his back - espoused. And if he <span class="accented">did</span> then declare for Solomon, it could hardly fail to procure him some amount of favour and consideration. He would thenceforward rank amongst the friends of the young king, and the words "thou hast with thee" would accurately describe his position] <span class="cmt_word">Shimei, the son of Gera</span> [another Shimei, the son of Elah, is mentioned (<a href="../../par/1_kings/4-11.htm">1 Kings 4:11</a>) as Solomon's officer <span class="accented">in Benjamin.</span> Gera must not be thought of as the "father" of Shimei, except in the sense of ancestor. He was removed from him by many generations, being the son of Bela and the grandson of Benjamin (<a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/7-6.htm">1 Chronicles 7:6</a>).

He was well known as the son of Benjamin's firstborn (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8.htm">1 Chronicles 8</a>:l), and the head of a house in Benjamin. Professor Gardiner (American translation of Lange, textual note, p. 29), following the LXX. and Vulg., insists that, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (with the article) can only mean "son of the Jaminite, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of the descendants of Jamin, a son of Simeon." But this is directly contrary to what we read 9 <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a>, viz., that Shimei was of "a family of the house of Saul," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, a Benjamite.

It may have lain in one of the waddies branching out from the ravine which runs continuously alongside the steep descent to Jericho. The event narrated in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> as happening at Bahurim may well have served to inflame Shimei's hatred.

The age of Joab and Shimei would make the Divine Nemesis the more conspicuous. Men would "see that there was a God that judgeth in the earth"] <span class="cmt_word">bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span> The Auth. Version here needlessly alters the <span class="accented">order</span> of the original, which should be followed wherever it can be (and it generally can) without sacrifice of idiom and elegance. In this case the alteration, by the slight prominence it gives to "hoar head" and to "blood," gives a factitious harshness to the sentence. The Hebrew stands thus: "And thou shalt bring down his hoar head with blood to Sheol." This order of the words also exhibits somewhat more clearly the sequence of thought, which is this: "Thou art wise, therefore thou knowest what by law thou shouldest do. What thou shalt do is, thou shalt bring down," etc. It is clear from these words that if David was actuated by malice, by a "passionate desire to punish those who had wronged him" (Plumptre, Dict. Bib., art. "Solomon"), or by "fierce and profound vindictiveness" (Stanley, "Jewish Church," vol. 2. p. 135), he was profoundly unconscious of it. If it was "a dark legacy of hate" (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>) he was bequeathing to Solomon, then he stands before us in these last hours either as an unctuous hypocrite, or as infatuated and inconsistent to the last degree. That the man who, in his opening words (ver. 3), enjoined upon his son, in the most emphatic manner, a strict and literal obedience to the law of Heaven, should in these subsequent words, delivered almost in the same breath, require him to satiate a long-cherished and cruel revenge upon Joab and Shimei (the latter of whom he had twice delivered from death), is an instance of self contradiction which is almost, if not quite, without parallel. But as I have showed elsewhere, at some length, it is a superficial and entirely erroneous view of David's last words, which supposes them to have been inspired by malice or cruelty. His absorbing idea was clearly this, that he had not "kept the charge of the Lord;" that he, the chief magistrate, the "revenger to execute wrath," by sparing Joab and Shimei, the murderer and the blasphemer, both of whose lives were forfeited to justice, had failed in his duty, had weakened the sanctions of law, and compromised the honour of the Most High. He is too old and too weak to execute the sentence of the law now, but for the safety of his people, for the security of his throne, it must be done, and therefore Solomon, who was under no obligation to spare the criminals his father had spared, must be required to do it. Of the Jewish king it might be said with a special propriety, <span class="accented">"Rex est lex loquens,"</span> and seldom has the voice of law spoken with greater dignity and fidelity than by David in this dying charge. To say, as Harwood does, (Lange, American Trans., p. 32) that "nothing but sophistry can justify his [David's] charge to Solomon, not to let the unfortunate man [Shimei] die in peace," merely shows how imperfectly the writer has entered into the spirit of the theocratic law, that law under which David lived, and by which alone he could be governed and govern others.

Despite the pitiful failure of his first conspiracy, and notwithstanding Solomon's generous condonation of his treason, he cannot forget that he was, and is, the eldest surviving son, and had been very near the throne. And as to the kingdom being his brother's by Divine appointment, he cannot have been ignorant of that long ago (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), yet he conspired all the same.

Bib., art. "Solomon") says this "narrative is not a little perplexing." He then specially remarks on the strangeness of Bathsheba's interceding for Adonijah, and also on Solomon's "flashing into fiercest wrath" at her request. He explains the facts, however, by "Mr. Grove's ingenious theory identifying Abishag with the Shulamite (<a href="../../par/songs/6-13.htm">Song of Solomon 6:13</a>), the heroine of the Song of Songs." It is "the passionate love of Solomon for the fairest among women' that has made Bathsheba, "hitherto supreme, to fear a rival influence, and to join in any scheme for its removal." The king's vehement abruptness is in like manner accounted for. He sees in the request at once an attempt to deprive him of the woman he loves and a plot to keep him still in the tutelage of childhood. Of the ingenuity of this theory no one can doubt, nor yet that it may <span class="accented">possibly</span> represent the actual facts. But it is not necessary, nor does it help much to the explanation of the narrative. Bathsheba's intervention may easily be accounted for by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her desire to conciliate her son's most formidable rival; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> her feminine interest in a love match; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> her pride, which could not but be flattered, on being assured that her influence with the king was so great. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nor is it any more difficult to assign a reason for Solomon's sudden outburst of anger. This request is evidence to him of a fresh plot against his throne, a plot so skilfully laid that its abettors have been able to deceive his own mother, and have made her a tool for its advancement. Surely this is quite enough to account for Solomon's indignation. And the theory of a love story has this disadvantage, that the young king completely ignores it in what follows, all his concern being about the kingdom, and not one word being said about the woman; and again - and this is almost fatal - his mention of Joab and Abiathar, and his subsequent dealings with them, prove conclusively that he suspected a conspiracy against his crown, not a scheme, in which these latter could have had no interest, and therefore no part, to rob him of a mistress] <span class="cmt_word">ask for him the kingdom also</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and ask for him  =  </span> and (you will next) ask for him; or, Aye, ask for him, etc. It was quite natural that Solomon should see in Adonijah's suit for Abishag an indirect, but none the less real or dangerous, attempt to compass his own downfall. For it was one of the customs of  Oriental monarchies that the harem of a sovereign descended to his successor. Thus the impostor Smerdis took possession of the harem of Cambyses (Herod. 3:68), while Darius in turn had some of the wives of Smerdis (3:88). And what is much more to the point, a similar custom obtained amongst the Jews. David, for example, succeeded to the wives, along with the kingdom, of Saul (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a>). And we see from the case of Abner and Rizpah (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>), and still more from that of Absalom (ch. 16:22), that to "take possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty" (Lord A. Hervey, Speak. Com. on <a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>). Now all these instances were of too recent a date, and had attracted far too much attention at the time, to have made it possible for them to have escaped either Solomon's or Adonijah's observation. They manifest "such a close connection in public opinion between the title to the crown and the possession of the deceased monarch's wives, that to have granted Adonijah's request would have been the strongest encouragement to his pretensions" (Rawlinson <span class="accented">in loco</span>). It may be said that Abishag had not really been the concubine of David (ch. 1:4), which is true, and which explains what would otherwise have been the astonishing impiety of Adonijah (<a href="../../par/leviticus/18-8.htm">Leviticus 18:8</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>), and the wonderful complaisance of Bathsheba. There is no warrant for charging Adonijah (as is done by a Lapide, Wordsworth, <span class="accented">al.</span>) with defying the Divine law and seeking an incestuous alliance, for the historian is careful to represent Abishag as David's attendant, and <span class="accented">not</span> as his wife. But it is hardly probable that the nation at large knew this. People generally could only suppose that this fair young girl, chosen out of all the thousands of Israel because of her beauty, had become to all intents and purposes one of the royal seraglio. It is almost a certainty, therefore, that Adonijah's request concealed a plot for using Abishag as a stepping stone to the throne, and Solomon certainly is not to be blamed if he interpreted it by the light of contemporaneous history, and by the usages of his time and country. He knew that his brother had made one deliberate effort to supplant him, and therefore he could only conclude that this was a second, though veiled, attempt to deprive him of his kingdom]; <span class="cmt_word">even for him and for Abiathar the priest, and for</span> <span class="cmt_word">Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> [The LXX. and other translators appear to have had a slightly different text before them.

We can hardly believe, however, that in these conversations we have the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the speakers If so, how were they preserved and handed down to the author? Even a "court scribe" would hardly catch every turn of expression. And possibly this interview with Bathsheba was private. It would almost seem, from the immediate mention of Joab and Abiathar, as if Solomon had received some prior intimation of this second conspiracy. Possibly his remarkable penetration had divined that mischief was brewing from the bearing of the three, who no doubt would be narrowly watched. Or he may have heard of frequent meetings on their part. Anyhow, Adonijah's suit is to him conclusive proof of a plot].

[Solomon has been accused of "a coldblooded vengeance" and of "that jealous cruelty so common in Oriental despots," in ordering the execution of his brother. But unjustly. It is to be remembered that on the occasion of Adonijah's first rebellion the young monarch had displayed the greatest magnanimity towards him. He might then have justly decreed against him the death which no doubt the conspirators had designed against him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-12.htm">1 Kings 1:12</a>.) Adonijah, by fleeing to the altar, showed that he had good grounds for fearing the avenging sword. He was clearly conscious that he had merited the death of the traitor. But Solomon spared him, during good behaviour. He warned him that "if wickedness were found in him" he should die (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a>.) His first treason, consequently, was not to be lost sight of, in case he were guilty of a fresh offence. And now that he is found conspiring again; now that he abuses the royal clemency, and seeks by chicanery and intrigue to snatch his brother's crown, the sentence of death takes effect. This renewed attempt, after failure and forgiveness, must have convinced the king that Adonijah's pretensions would be a standing menace to the peace and prosperity of his empire, and therefore he owed it to himself, to his subjects, and above all to God, who had entrusted him with the crown, to put this restless and dangerous plotter out of the way. To pass over a second offence would be a virtual encouragement of sedition, for it would show that the king was weak and might be trifled with. Adonijah therefore must die, not only in expiation of his treason, but as an example to the subjects of Solomon, that the disaffected, including all Adonijah's partizans, might be awed into obedience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:26-35.

This reading is perhaps too summarily dismissed by most commentators, as involving a statement which would be self evident and superfluous. But it is not so. The meaning would then be that Joab had inclined to Adonijah, and had not, subsequently, gone over to the side of Solomon - information which is much less obvious than that he had not "gone after Absalom." The Arabic version may thus be nearest the truth, which reads, "Neither did he love Solomon." Somewhat similarly Josephus.] <span class="cmt_word">And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> [As Adonijah had done before him (<a href="../../par/1_kings/1-50.htm">1 Kings 1:50</a>). His flight is almost certain evidence of his guilt. ("Joab vero seipsum prodidit." Munster.) Why should he flee, if conscious of innocence? Solomon had acted generously before, and Joab would not be aware of David's dying instructions. His two assassinations had remained so long unpunished that he would hardly expect to be called to an account for them now. We have here, therefore, another indication of a second conspiracy, and it is an old belief (Theodorot, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that Joab had suggested to Adonijah the plan of marriage with Abishag. Some have asked why Joab should flee to the altar when his crimes deprived him of the right of the sanctuary. But a drowning man grasps at a straw. It is probable that he never thought of his murders, but only of his treason. According to the Rabbis, death at the altar ensured him burial amongst his fathers (Munster). But, if this were so, it would hardly enter into his calculations.

But it is more probable that he counted on death, and that a feeling of superstition, or of defiance, had decided him to meet his doom there. It should be borne in mind that gross superstition not uncommonly accompanies irreligion and brutality; and it is quite conceivable that Joab hoped for some indefinable benefit from the shadow of the altar, much as the poor Polish Jew expects from burial in Jerusalem. Or his motive may have been defiance, thinking he would "render Solomon odious to the people, as a profaner of the Holy Place" (M. Henry). It can hardly have been to put off forever so short a time the execution, as Bishop Hall imagines.]

Possibly because the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a> seemed to Solomon to require it.

Was it not rather that the corpse might be removed with all possible haste from the sanctuary, which it defiled, and hidden from view, as one accursed of God, in the earth? So Bishop Hall: "He sends Benaiah to take away the offender both from God and men, from the altar and the world"]; <span class="cmt_word">that thou mayest take away</span> [LXX.

Solomon evidently believed that the guilt of blood was upon him and his house so long as Abner's and Amasa's blood remained unavenged ("The blood that is not required from the murderer will be required from the magistrate." Henry), and that he and his seed might have to answer for it, as Saul's seed had done (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 9</a>). This is one of the many considerations which show that both David and Solomon were actuated not by "cold-blooded vengeance" or "long-cherished resentment" (Stanley), but by a sense of duty. In fact, Jewish law imperatively demanded the death of Joab, and to spare him was to violate all law, and to imperil the throne and the people. "Only a superficial observer," says Ewald, "can here reproach Solomon with needless severity."]

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/2-46.htm">1 Kings 2:46</a></div><div class="verse">So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the king commanded Ben-aiah the son of Jehoiada, which went out</span> and fell <span class="cmt_word">upon him that he died</span>. [The execution of Shimei has, perhaps, on the  whole given more offence than that of Joab or even Adonijah. He, at any rate, was not "a murderer whom vengeance suffereth not to live," nor had he taken any part in recent conspiracies. On the contrary, he seems to have lived quietly enough under the eye of the king. And it consequently has the appearance of cruelty and malevolence that Solomon should "press the letter of a compact against him," especially when, by returning to Jerusalem, he placed his life at Solomon's mercy. But it is not difficult to offer a complete justification of Solomon's action in this matter. In the first place, it is to be remembered that cruelty had no part in his character. In his long reign of forty years there are absolutely no evidences of a brutal and tyrannical disposition. There is a strong presumption, consequently, that he was not actuated by cruelty on this occasion, a presumption which finds support in the consideration that Solomon was much too sagacious to prejudice himself in popular estimation at the commencement of his reign by proceedings which would have the least suspicion of vindictiveness. And <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with this probability the facts of the case entirely agree. Shimei's life, as we have seen, was forfeited to Jewish law. As he had so long been spared, however, the king gave him a gracious respite. The conditions imposed were not onerous. Shimei had but to keep his parole and he would live; to break it and he would assuredly die. He <span class="accented">did</span> break it; not without provocation, it may be, but he broke it, and broke too his solemn oath. It may be said it was hard he should lose his slaves, but better, surely, lose them than his life. Besides, there were other ways of recovering them; or, if he must pursue them in person, his proper course was evidently to ask the king's permission. That he did not do so is in itself a suspicious circumstance, and Solomon might reasonably think that the flight of the slaves was but a <span class="accented">feint</span>, and that Shimei's visit to a foreign court had really a political object. But, be that as it may, the king had protested unto him that if he went any whither, he should most certainly die. When he went, when he despised the royal command and disregarded his sacred oath, how was it possible for Solomon to break his word? To do so would have been inevitably to compromise himself with his subjects, and to forfeit their reverence and trust. Besides, there was a duty he owed to his dead father, and above all, one which he owed to the living God. He had now the opportunity for which his father bade him wait, of putting into force the provisions of the Mosaic law, of requiring the death of the blasphemer, of showing his subjects that the law could not be defied with impunity, that though vengeance was not executed speedily against evil works, still retribution was certain in the long run, and so of teaching them a much needed lesson of obedience and respect of authority. Every consideration, therefore, of justice, morality, filial piety, and religion warranted him in putting Shimei to death. Every imputation of weakness, irresolution, disregard of his plighted word, compromise of his royal dignity, and indifference to religion might justly have been levelled against him, had he interfered between Shimei and the sword of Justice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../1_kings/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="1 Kings 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Kings 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../1_kings/3.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="1 Kings 3"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Kings 3" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/1_kings/3.htm"><title>1 Kings 3 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/1_kings/3.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/1_kings/3.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/1_kings/3-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../1_kings/2.htm" title="1 Kings 2">&#9668;</a> 1 Kings 3 <a href="../1_kings/4.htm" title="1 Kings 4">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a></div><div class="verse">And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Solomon made affinit</span>y [Not "alliance" (as some have supposed) but relationship.

It has been assumed (Bunsen, Ewald, Brugsch, <span class="accented">al.</span>) that it was Psusennes II., the last king of that house, on the supposition that he reigned 35 years, (as stated by Eusebius), but according to Africanus, his reign was limited to 14 years. It is wiser to say, therefore, with Mr. Poole (Dict. Bib., "Pharaoh") that this Pharaoh "cannot yet be identified on Manetho's list." It is also impossible to decide whether the alliance was first sought by Solomon with a view to win over a powerful and dangerous neighbour (Thenius), to whose inroads his northern border was exposed, and especially to counteract the influence (<a href="../../par/1_kings/11-21.htm">1 Kings 11:21</a>) of Hadad (Plumptre), or whether the marriage was proposed by Pharaoh because the 21st dynasty "had then become very weak" (Rawlinson) and its head desired "friendly relations with the kingdom of Israel, which had grown into a power to be dreaded" (Keil). But we may reasonably suppose that the alliance "must have been to most Israelites a very startling one" (Plumptre.)

"At the same time, it was only when the foreign wives renounced idolatry, that such marriages were in accordance with the spirit of the law" (Keil).

The idea rather is that just as he was obliged to bring his Egyptian wife into the city of David, because his palace was not yet finished, so the people were compelled to sacrifice on the high places, because the temple was not yet built (Keil), and "the place" where God would put His name had only just been chosen (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/22-1.htm">1 Chronicles 22:1</a>)] <span class="cmt_word">the people sacrificed</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">were sacrificing, i.e.</span>, habitually, constantly] <span class="cmt_word">in high places</span> [All nations have chosen hill tops for acts of worship, perhaps as being nearer heaven.

And the use of high places for this purpose was not <span class="accented">distinctly</span> condemned in the Law. It is true the Hebrews were commanded to have but one place of sacrifice (<a href="../../par/leviticus/17-9.htm">Leviticus 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5, 11, 13, 26, 27</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/joshua/22-29.htm">Joshua 22:29</a>), and this no doubt was, if not an indirect prohibition, a discouragement of such sanctuaries. It has been held, however, that this command was purely prospective, and it is certainly remarkable that even when the Israelites were settled in the promised land, and the tabernacle was set up (<a href="../../par/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), altars were constantly built and sacrifices offered on high places, and sometimes, as in the case of Gideon (<a href="../../par/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>), and Manoah (<a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19, 20</a>), by express Divine command.

It is highly probable, therefore, that though the contemporaries of Joshua took a different view (as <a href="../../par/joshua/22-15.htm">Joshua 22:15-31</a> proves), the men of a later age excused themselves on the ground stated in the text, that "there was no house built unto the name of the Lord." It has been held by some that "had they not sacrificed and burnt incense on high places, they could not have sacrificed or burnt incense at all" (Bp. Horsley); but this seems to overlook the fact that there was one place provided for sacrifices - the door of the tabernacle &#8212;  and that for some reason or other they sacrificed elsewhere. And the reason, no doubt, was the one assigned by the historian. It should be added that this term "high place" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) came to be used of <span class="accented">all</span> places of worship, not only on heights, but even those in valleys (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>).

The question is one of some nicety, but the balance of evidence is distinctly in favour of connecting the title with Azariah, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "Azariah son of Zadok was the priest." This brings us to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> What are we to understand by "the priest " - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>? It is urged by Keil, Bahr, <span class="accented">al.</span> that this cannot mean "priest" in the ordinary sense of the word, still less "high priest," for the following reasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Because the high priests of Solomon are mentioned presently, viz., Abiathar and Zadok, and the Jews never had <span class="accented">three</span> high priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Because the Azariah who was high priest under Solomon for the words of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>, "He it is that executed the priest's office," etc, must belong to the Azariah of ver. 9, and have got accidentally misplaced - was the son of Ahimaaz, not of Zadok. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because no grandson of Zadok could then be old enough to sustain the office of high priest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Because in one passage (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>) <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> is used of privy councillors and of the sons of <span class="accented">David</span>, who cannot have been sacrificing priests. Keil consequently would understand that Azariah was "administrator of the kingdom, or prime minister." Similarly Bahr. But in favour of the ordinary meaning of the word are these powerful considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> All the versions translate the word by "priest," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they understand by the term a spiritual person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Whatever may be the case with <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> priest" (<span class="accented">par excellence</span>) can only be understood of the <span class="accented">high</span> priest (ch. 1:8, 38; <a href="../../par/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/21-21.htm">Leviticus 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/11-9.htm">2 Kings 11:9, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4, 8, 10, 12, 14</a>.

The question is discussed with great learning by Professor Plumptre (Dict. Bib., art. "Priest"), who suggests that "David and his sons may have been admitted, not to distinctively priestly functions, such as burning incense (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-40.htm">Numbers 16:40</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-18.htm">2 Chronicles 26:18</a>), but to an honorary, titular priesthood. To wear the ephod in processions (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>) at the time when this was the special badge of the order (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>), to join the priests and Levites in their songs and dances, might have been conceded, with no deviation from the Law, to the members of the royal house." There is one difficulty however in the way of accepting this ingenious and otherwise sufficient explanation, namely, that it seems hardly likely that the title of priest would be freely accorded by Hebrew writers to men who were expressly <span class="accented">excluded</span> from all "distinctively priestly functions," especially after the use of the same word in the preceding verse (17) to designate the high priest. And I venture to suggest that the discharge by David's sons of the semi-priestly functions just referred to occasioned so much remark as to head to the application of the term "priest" to them in a special conventional sense; in fact, that it became a sort of <span class="accented">soubriquet</span>, which rather implied that they were <span class="accented">not</span> priests than that they were. (Notice <span class="accented">the order</span> of <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>, Hebrews) And observe <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> if we are to understand by "the <span class="accented">priest"</span> in ver. 2, "prime minister;" by <span class="accented">"priests"</span> in ver. 4, "high priests," and by <span class="accented">"priest"</span> in ver 5, "principal officer," language has no certain meaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The mention of Azariah as "the priest" in the same list with Zadok and Abiathar is easily accounted for. We know that Abiathar was deposed at the beginning of Solomon's reign (<a href="../../par/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27</a>), and Zadok must then have been an old man. Their names consequently are  recorded (ver. 4) because they were high priests for a brief period of the reign, but Azariah is mentioned first as "the priest" because he was high priest during most of the time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> "Azariah the <span class="accented">son</span> of Zadok" is quite compatible with the fact that Azariah was really the son of Ahimaaz. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> is constantly used in the sense of "descendant," and especially "grandson." (<a href="../../par/genesis/29-5.htm">Genesis 29:5</a>: 31:28, 55: and see on ch. 2:8,"the son of Gera.") Zadok is no doubt mentioned as better known than Ahimaaz, and probably because Azariah succeeded him directly in the office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> The age of Azariah must be uncertain, and Solomon's reign was a long one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> The position of his name - first - accords well with the idea that he was high priest, which I conclude that he was. It is worthy of remark that in the lists of David the military officers of the kingdom occupy the first place; in those of Solomon, the civil and religious dignitaries. "The princes of Solomon are, with one exception (ver. 4) ministers of peace." - Wordsworth.

There is, perhaps, more weight in the objection that Chalcol and Darda are here distinctly said to be "the sons of Mahol," though here again it has been observed that Mahol (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) means <span class="accented">pipe</span> or <span class="accented">dance</span>, and the "sons of Mahol," consequently, may merely be a synonym, agreeably to Eastern idiom (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/12-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:4</a>, with which cf. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>), for "musicians." We may therefore allow that the four names may be those of sons (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, descendants) of Zerah. But the question now presents itself: Are Ethan and Heman to be identified with the well known precentors of David? Against their identity are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That Ethan the singer (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-31.htm">1 Chronicles 6:31</a>) is described as the son of Kishi (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-44.htm">1 Chronicles 6:44</a>), elsewhere called Kushaiah (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>), and of the family of Merari; as a Levite that is, instead of a descendant of Judah, and that Heman, who is called the singer, or musician (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-33.htm">1 Chronicles 6:33</a>), and the "king's seer" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/25-5.htm">1 Chronicles 25:5</a>) is said to be a son of Joel, a grandson of the prophet Samuel, and one of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-17.htm">1 Chronicles 15:17</a>). The first impression in this case, therefore, is that they <span class="accented">must be</span> distinct. But it should be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the sons - in the strict sense - of Zerah are nowhere else named for their wisdom, whereas the royal singer and seer probably owed their appointments to their genius, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that though Levites, they may have been incorporated (possibly like Jair, through marriage - see note on ver. 13 above, and cf. <a href="../../par/ezra/2-61.htm">Ezra 2:61</a>) into the tribe of Judah. The Levite in <a href="../../par/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7</a> is spoken of as belonging to the family of Judah, because he dwelt in Bethlehem of Judah, and Elkanah the Levite is called an  Ephraimite in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>, because in his civil capacity he was incorporated into the tribe of Ephraim" (Keil). It must be admitted, however, that the <span class="accented">natural</span> interpretation of <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/2-6.htm">1 Chronicles 2:6</a> is that the "sons" of Zerah there mentioned were his immediate and actual descendants, and not Levites who long centuries afterwards were somehow incorporated into his family.

Practically, the cedars are now found in one place only, though Ehrenberg is said to have found them in considerable numbers to the north of the road between Baalbek and Tripoli. "At the head of Wady Kadisha there is a vast recess in the central ridge of Lebanon, some eight miles in diameter. Above it rise the loftiest summits in Syria, streaked with perpetual snow...

It would seem as if that part of Lebanon where the cedars grew belonged to Hiram's dominion. "The northern frontier of Canaan did not reach as far as Bjerrsh" (Keil), where the cedar grove is now. The idea of some older writers that the cedars belonged to Solomon, and  that he only asked Hiram for artificers ("that they <span class="accented">hew</span> me cedar trees," etc.) is negatived by ver. 10. It is true that "all Lebanon" was given to Israel (<a href="../../par/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>), but they did not take it.

See Homer, Iliad 6:290; 23. 743; Odys. 4:84, 618; 17:4.24. Cf. Virg.

But what deserves especial notice here is the fact that the Zidonians constructed their houses of <span class="accented">wood</span>, and were celebrated from the earliest times as skilful builders. The fleets which the Phoenicians constructed for purposes of commerce would ensure them a supply of clever workmen. Wordsworth aptly remarks on the part the heathen thus took in rearing a temple for the God of Jacob. Cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/60-10.htm">Isaiah 60:10, 13</a>.]

We are not warranted by the expression of the text in concluding that Hiram believed in the exclusive divinity of the God of Israel, or "identified Jehovah with Melkarth his god" (Rawlinson), much less that he was  proselyte to the faith of David and Solomon. All that is certain is that he believed the Jehovah as God was quite compatible with the retention of a firm faith in Baa1 and Astarte. It is also possible that he here adopts a language which he knew would be acceptable to Solomon, or the historian may have given us his thoughts in a Hebrew dread It is noticeable that the LXX. has simply <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>] <span class="cmt_word">which hath given unto David a wise son</span> [Compare <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-48.htm">1 Kings 1:48</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/2-9.htm">1 Kings 2:9</a>. The proof of wisdom lay in Solomon's fulfilling his wise father's purposes, and in his care for the worship of God. "Wise," however, is not used here in the sense of "pious," as Bahr affirms.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: <i>and</i> I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hiram sent to Solomon</span> [in writing, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-11.htm">2 Chronicles 2:11</a>. It is instructive to remember in connexion with this fact that, according to the universal belief of antiquity, the use of letters, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the art of writing, was communicated to the Greeks by the Phoenicians. Gesenius, indeed, holds that the <span class="accented">invention</span> of letters is also due to them. See the interesting remarks of Mr. Twisleton, Dict. Bib. 2. pp. 866-868], <span class="cmt_word">saying</span>, <span class="cmt_word">I have considered the things which thou sentest unto me for</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heard the things</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, message) <span class="accented">which thou sentest unto</span> me]: <span class="cmt_word">and I will do all thy desire concerning</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">in, i.e.</span>, as to] timber [or <span class="accented">trees</span>] of cedar [Heb. <span class="accented">cedars</span>] <span class="accented">and timber of fir</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">trees of cypresses.</span> This is, perhaps, the proper place to inquire what. trees are intended by the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, here respectively translated" cedar" and "fir." As to the first, it is impossible to restrict the word to the one species (<span class="accented">Pinus cedrus or Cedrus Libani</span>) which is now known as the cedar of Lebanon, or, indeed, to <span class="accented">any</span> single plant. That the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span>, one of the most magnificent of trees, is meant in such passages as <a href="../../par/ezekiel/31.htm">Ezekiel 31</a>, <a href="../../par/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>, etc., admits of no manner of doubt. It is equally clear, however, that in other passages the term "cedar" must refer to some other tree. In <a href="../../par/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>, and <a href="../../par/leviticus/14-6.htm">Leviticus 14:6</a>, <span class="accented">e.g., the juniper</span> would seem to be meant. "The cedar could not have been procured in the desert without great difficulty, but the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus oxycedrus</span>) is most plentiful there." (The "cedar" of our pencils, it may be remarked, is a kind of juniper - <span class="accented">Juniperus Bermudiana.</span>) In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>, "they have taken cedars of Lebanon to make <span class="accented">masts</span> for thee," it is probable that the <span class="accented">Pinus</span>  <span class="accented">Halepensis</span>, not, as was formerly thought, the Scotch fir (<span class="accented">Pinus sylvestris</span>), is intended. The <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> appears to be indifferently adapted to any such purpose, for which, however, the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis <span class="cmt_word"></span>is</span> eminently fitted. But in the text, as throughout ch. 5-8, the reference, it can hardly be doubted, is to the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It is true the wood of this species is neither beautiful nor remarkably durable. Dr. Lindley calls it the "worthless, though magnificent cedar," but the former adjective, however true it may be of English-grown cedar, cannot justly be applied to the tree of the Lebanon mountain. The writer has some wood in his possession, brought by him from the Lebanon, and though it has neither fragrance nor veining, it is unmistakably a hard and resinous wood. And it should be remembered that it was only employed by Solomon in the <span class="accented">interior</span> of the temple, and was there, for the most part, overlaid with gold, and that the climate of Palestine is much less destructive than our own. There seems to be no sufficient reason, therefore, for rejecting the traditional and till recently universal belief that the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani</span> was the timber chosen for the temple use. Mr. Houghton, in Smith's Dict. Bib., vol. 3. App. A. p. 40, who speaks of it "as being <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the</span> firmest and grandest of the conifers," says at the same time that "it has no particular quality to recommend it for building purposes; it was probably therefore not very extensively used in the construction of the temple." But no other tree can be suggested which better suits the conditions of the sacred narrative. The <span class="accented">deodara</span>, which has found favour with some writers, it is now positively stated, does not grow near the Lebanon. It may be added that, under the name of <span class="accented">Eres, the</span> yew was probably included. The timber used in the palaces of Nineveh, which was long believed to be cedar, is now proved to be yew (Dict. Bib., art. "Cedar"). However it is certain that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;</span> is a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> which includes, at any rate, the pine, the cedar, and the juniper, in confirmation of which it may be mentioned that at the present day, "the name <span class="accented">arz is</span> applied by the Arabs to all three" (Royle, in Kitto's Cyclop., art. "Eres"). The Grove of Cedars now numbers about 450 trees, great and small. Of these about a dozen are of prodigious size and considerable antiquity, possibly carrying us back (as the natives think) to the time of Solomon. Their precise age, however, can only be a matter of conjecture. The identification of the "fir" is even more precarious than that of the cedar. Celsius would see in this the true cedar of Lebanon. Others identify it with the juniper (<span class="accented">Juniperus excelsa</span>) or with the <span class="accented">Pinus Halepensis</span>, but most writers (among whom are Keil and Bahr) believe the evergreen cypress (<span class="accented">Cupressus sempervirens</span>) to be intended. Very probably the name <span class="accented">Berosh</span> comprehended two or three different species, as the cypress, the juniper, and the savine. The first named grows even near the summits of the mountain. Bahr says it is inferior to cedar (but see above). According to Winer, it is well fitted for building purposes, as" it is not eaten by worms, and is almost imperishable and very light." It is certainly of a harder and closer grain, and more durable than the <span class="accented">Cedrus Libani.</span> It shows the brevity of our account that Solomon has not mentioned his desire for "fir" as well as" cedar." This is disclosed in Hiram's reply, and in the parallel passage of the chronicler. It is also to be noticed that in the text the request for <span class="accented">materials</span> is more prominently brought to view, while in Chronicles the petition is for <span class="accented">workmen.</span>

It winds up sublime glens, and zigzags up rocky acclivities, and passes over stone-strewn terraces," etc. (Porter, Handbook, p. 583.) To the writer it appeared to be the most rugged and dangerous road in Palestine. It is possible that the timber was collected and floated at Gebal (Biblus. See note on ver. 18). Beyrout, the present port of the Lebanon, is 27 hours distant <span class="accented">via Tripoli.</span> But cedars would then, no doubt, be found nearer the sea. And the ancients (as the stones of Baalbek, etc., prove) were not altogether deficient in mechanical appliances.

The fact that 20,000 ears of wheat formed a part of each has led to their being confounded (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> in the marginal references). It is noticeable that when the <span class="accented">second</span> temple was built, cedar wood was again brought to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">rid</span> Joppa, in return for "meat and drink and oil unto them of Zidon" (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-7.htm">Ezra 3:7</a>). The selection of <span class="accented">food</span> as the hire of his servants by Hiram almost amounts to an undesigned coincidence. Their narrow strip of cornland, between the roots of Lebanon and the coast - Phoenicia proper ("the great plain of the city of Sidon," Josephus. Ant. 5:03, 1) is only 28 miles long, with an average breadth of one mile-compelled the importation of corn and oil. Ezekiel (Ezekiel 27:17) mentions wheat, honey, oil, and balm as exported from Palestine to the markets of Tyre. It has been justly remarked that the fact that Phoenicia was thus dependent upon Palestine for its breadstuffs explains the unbroken peace that prevailed between the two countries (Heeren. See Dict. Bib. if. p. 865).

None of the latter were reduced to bondage (<a href="../../par/1_kings/9-22.htm">1 Kings 9:22</a>), while the former had long been employed in servile work. The Gibeonites were reduced to serfdom by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/9-27.htm">Joshua 9:27</a>), and the rest of the Canaanites as they were conquered  (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-10.htm">Joshua 6:10</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-13.htm">Joshua 17:13</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29, 30</a>).

"The mountain" must be Lebanon. But surely the <span class="accented">stone</span> was not transported, to any great extent, like the wood, so great a distance over land and sea, especially when it abounded on the spot. (The tradition that the stone was quarried at Baalbek is quite unworthy of credence. It has no doubt sprung from the huge stones found there. "The temple was built of the beautiful white stone of the country, the hard <span class="accented">missal"</span> (Warren, p. 60.) It is true the number of wood cutters would thus appear to be very great, but it is to be remembered how few comparatively were the appliances or machines of those days: almost everything must be done by manual labour. And Pliny tells us that no less than 360,000 men were employed for twenty years on one of the pyramids. It is possible, however, that the huge foundations mentioned below (ver. 17) were brought from Lebanon.]

The stones at the south-east angle of the walls of the Haram (Mosque of Omar) are "unquestionably of Jewish masonry" (Porter, Handbook, p. 115). "One is 23 2:9 in. long; whilst others vary from 17 to 20 feet in length. Five courses of them are nearly entire" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) As Herod, in rebuilding the edifice, would seem to have had nothing to do with the foundations, we may safely connect these huge blocks with the time of Solomon. It is also probable that some at least of the square pillars, ranged in fifteen rows, and measuring five feet each side, which form the foundations of the Mosque <span class="accented">El Aksa</span>, and the supports of the area of the Haram, are of the same date and origin (cf. Ewald, Hist. Israel, 3:233). Porter holds that they are "coeval with the oldest part of the external walls." Many of them, the writer observed, were monoliths. The extensive vaults which they enclose are unquestionably "the subterranean vaults of the temple area" mentioned by Josephus (B.J. 5:3. 1), and the <span class="accented">"cavati sub terra montes"</span> of Tacitus. It may be added here that the recent explorations in Jerusalem have brought to light many evidences of Phoenician handiwork.]

He would understand, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that the Zidonian workmen were Giblites; but this is doubtful. The Giblites are selected, no doubt, for special mention because of the prominent part they took in the work. Gebal, as its ancient and extensive ruins prove, was a place of much importance, and lying as it did on the coast, and near the cedar forests, would naturally have an important share in the cutting and shipping of the timber. Indeed, it is not improbable that it was at this port that the land transport ended, and the rafts were made. A road ran anciently from Gebal to Baalbak, so that the transport was not impracticable. But as the forests were probably of great extent, there may have been two or three depots at which the timber was floated] so they prepared timber [Heb. <span class="accented">the timber</span>] and stones [Heb. <span class="accented">the stones</span>] to build the house.

Grave doubts are entertained as to its genuineness. Lord A. Hervey (Dict. Bib. vol. 2. p. 22) says it is "manifestly erroneous." Rawlinson considers it to be "an interpolation into the sacred text" (p. 515). And it is to he observed, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> that the LXX. reads 440 instead of 480 years - a discrepancy which is suspicious, and argues some amount of incertitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Origen quotes this verse without these words (Comm. in S.

It is admitted that we have no other instance in the Old Testament where this is done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> It is difficult to reconcile this statement with other chronological notices both of the Old and New Testaments. For taking the numbers which we find in the Hebrew text of the books which refer to this period, they sum up to considerably more than 480 years. The time of the Judges alone comprises 410 years at the least. It should be stated, however, with regard to the <span class="accented">chronology</span> of the period last mentioned <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it only pretends to furnish round numbers - 20, 40, and the like - and evidently does not aim at exactitude; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that there is good ground for suspecting that the periods are not always consecutive; that in some cases, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, they overlap. We are not justified, therefore, because of the dates of the Judges in rejecting this statement. The question of New Testament chronology is somewhat more complicated. In <a href="../../par/acts/13-20.htm">Acts 13:20</a>, St. Paul states the period between the division of Canaan, by Joshua (<a href="../../par/joshua/14-1.htm">Joshua 14:1, 2</a>), and the time of Samuel the prophet as 450 years (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x7d;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>) But Lachmann, on the authority <span class="accented">of</span> A, B, C (and we may add <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>), considers the received text to be corrupt, and would place <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x2e;</span> Alford, however, treats this reading as "an attempt at correcting the difficult chronology of the verse," and says that "all attempts to reconcile" it with <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> "are arbitrary and forced." If, then, the received text is to stand - and it is to be noticed that the reigns of the Judges, including Samuel, sum up exactly to the period mentioned by St. Paul, 450 years - the interval between the Exodus and the erection of the temple cannot well have been less than 99 or 100 years longer, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 580 - Josephus makes it  592 - instead of 480 years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> The chronology of Josephus - to which by itself, perhaps, no great weight is to be attached, agrees with St. Paul's estimate, and of course contradicts that of the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> Nor does it seem to be a valid argument for the retention of the suspected words, that "the precision of the statement is a voucher for its accuracy." (Bahr, who adds, "Not only is the whole number of the years given, but also the year of the reign of the king, and even the month itself," for the genuineness of the later date, "<span class="accented">In the fourth year,"</span> etc., is not questioned.) The remark of Keil that the building of the temple marked a new and important epoch in the history of the chosen people, and so justified an exceptional reference to the birth or emancipation of the nation, though undoubtedly true, will hardly avail much against the considerations alleged above. On the whole, therefore, I confess to the belief that these words are the interpolation of a later hand (of which we shall find traces elsewhere), though it would, perhaps, be premature, with only the evidence now before us, to exclude them from the text. It is certainly noteworthy that such destructive critics as Ewald and Thenius are satisfied as to their genuineness], <span class="cmt_word">in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel</span> [according to the chronology of Ussher, this was A.M. 3000], <span class="cmt_word">in the month Zif</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, May. The word signifies <span class="accented">splendour</span>. The month was probably so called because of the brilliancy of its flowers (Gesen., Keil, al.)], <span class="cmt_word">which is the second month</span> [This explanation is added because before the captivity the months (with the exception of <span class="accented">Abib</span>) appear to have had no regular names, but were almost always designated by numbers. (See, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>). Only four pre-captivity names are recorded, and of these three are mentioned in connexion with the building of the temple, viz., <span class="accented">Zif</span> here and in ver. 37, <span class="accented">Bul</span> in ver. 38, and <span class="accented">Ethanim</span> in <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>. It has hence been inferred that these names were not in general use, but were restricted to public documents, etc. (Dict. Bib. if. 416), a supposition which, if correct, would account for the facility with which the old appellations were superseded by post-captivity names. The later name for this month was <span class="accented">Iyar</span> (Targum on <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2</a>)], <span class="cmt_word">that he began</span> [not in Heb.] <span class="cmt_word">to build the house of</span> [Heb. to] <span class="cmt_word">the Lord</span>. [The chronicler mentions the site (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), "In Mount Moriah ....in the threshing floor of Ornan," etc. We know from the extensive foundations yet remaining that the preparation of the platform on which the temple should stand must have been a work of considerable time and labour, and see Jos., Ant. 8:03.9, and Bell. Jud. 5:05.1. We can hardly be wrong in identifying the remarkable rock known as the <span class="accented">Sakrah</span>, over which the mosque of Omar (<span class="accented">Kubbet-es-Sakrah</span>) is built - the "pierced rock" of the Jerusalem Itinerary - with the threshing floor of Ornan. The reader will find an interesting paper on the site of the temple in "Scribner's Monthly," vol. 11. pp. 257-272. According to Mr. Beswick, whose measurements and conclusions it gives, the <span class="accented">porch</span> stood on the <span class="accented">Sakrah. Mr.</span> Conder, however, urges strong reasons ("Tent Work," pp. 187-9) for placing the <span class="accented">Holy of Holies</span> on the rock. We should then "see the Holy House in its natural and traditional position on the top of the mountain; we see the courts descending on either side, according to the present slopes of the hill; we find the great rock galleries dropping naturally into their right places; and finally, we see the temple, by the immutability of Oriental custom, still a temple, and the site of the great altar still consecrated [?] by the beautiful little chapel <span class="cmt_word">of</span> the chain."

Probably at first it signified, like <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fc6;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, the length from point of elbow to tip of little or middle finger. But it is obvious that this was an uncertain measure, and hence perhaps arose cubits of different length. According to Gesen. the cubit here mentioned, which was the older or sacred Mosaic cubit (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>), was six palms, while that of Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>), the royal Babylonian cubit, was seven, but on this as well as other points the authorities are very far from agreed. "The length of the cubit is one of the most knotty points of Hebrew archaeology" (Dict. Bib. 3, p. 1736). There is a general <span class="accented">consensus</span> of opinion, however in favour of understanding the cubit here mentioned as measuring 18 inches. Fergusson (Dict. Bib. 3:1451) considers this to be beyond question. It is certainly noteworthy that the measurements of Kings and Chronicles, of Ezra and Ezekiel, of Josephus and the Talmud, all agree, and we know that Josephus always uses the Greek cubit of 18 inches. Mr. Conder, however, maintains that the Hebrew cubit amounts to no more than <span class="accented">sixteen</span> inches. He says, "Maimonides tells us that the temple cubit was of 48 barleycorns, and any one who will take the trouble to measure barleycorns, will find that three go to the inch" - which gives 16 inches for the cubit. To this argument, which is not perhaps of much weight, he adds, what is of much greater moment, that "the Galilean synagogues, measured by it, give round numbers" (pp. 187-8)] <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</span> [It thus appears that the temple was but a small - compared with many churches, a <span class="accented">very</span> small - building. But its purpose and object must be considered. It was not for assemblies of the people. The congregation never met <span class="accented">within</span> it, but the worship was offered <span class="accented">towards</span> it. It was a place for the Holy Presence, and for the priests who ministered before it.]

It would certainly be out of all proportion. Towers are generally built about three times the height of the adjoining nave, but this would be six times as high, and moreover the porch did not taper to a point like a Gothic spire. It is much more probable, therefore, that there is a corruption of the text of Chronicles (see on 2 Chronicles 3:4) - errors in numbers are by no means infrequent - than that such a column could be erected to serve as a <span class="accented">porch</span>, or if erected - and this consideration appears to me to be decisive - could have been passed over by our author without notice. It is impossible, however, to say positively what the height of the porch was. Probably 30 cubits, the height of the house. Stanley characteristically puts it down as "more than 200 feet." It may be remarked here that Fergusson, following Josephus and the Talmud, contends that the temple had another building of the same height above it. See Dict. Bib. 3 p. 1456, and note on ver. 20.]

So many chambers could hardly have been required for the "preservation of temple stores and utensils" (Keil), or of offerings (Ewald). Whatever their use, we can hardly suppose that they were wholly without light, though nothing is said about windows. They may have had "fixed lattices."

According to Bahr, it was in order to preserve the great and costly stones of the temple intact; but others, with greater probability, hold that it was because it appeared unseemly to have the side chambers, which were for  semi-secular purposes (cubicles, perhaps), made an actual part of the sacred edifice. Anyhow, it is clear that the beams rested on ledges made in the walls; but whether in the temple wall only, or in the outer wall of the side structure also, is uncertain. The preceding sketch will not only illustrate the difference, but will help the reader to understand the description preceding. In drawing (1) rebatements are showed only in the temple or inner wall, In (2) they are showed in both walls. In (1) the edifice is represented with a fiat; in (2) with a span roof. Keil decides in favour of the first arrangement (1), and Bahr says somewhat positively, "The outer wall of the structure had no rests." In fact, he suggests that the whole of this side building may have been of wood. It must be admitted that we do know that there were rebatements in the wall A, whereas nothing is said as to the outer wall B. It may also be reasonably alleged that the considerations of fitness and sacredness which forbade the insertion of the beams into the sanctuary wall would not apply to the outer wall, which was a part of the side structure only. Against this view, however, may be urged the extreme thickness of wall which this method of building would necessitate. For unless we suppose that the floor of the ground story rested on the rock, and so was quite detached from the building, we must suppose four rebatements, so that if the wall at the top were two cubits wide, it would be no less than six cubits (or nine feet) at the bottom. It is true that the walls of ancient buildings were of extraordinary thickness, but it must also be remembered that the temple was not fifty feet high. However, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-9.htm">Ezekiel 41:9</a> suggests that the outside wall (B) may have been five cubits in thickness, and, if so, the inner wall would hardly be less. Fergusson, therefore, has some justification for putting each wall down as five cubits wide; but on the whole, perhaps, the plan represented in (1) appears the more probable. The historian here digresses for a moment to speak of the remarkable and, indeed, unprecedented way in which the temple was built, The stories were shaped and prepared beforehand in the quarry, so that there was nothing to do on their arrival in the temple area but to fit them into their place in the building.]

It was apparently the belief of the ancients that stones of proper shape and size were provided in their bed by God (so Theodoret and Procopius,) It is inconceivable, however, that no dressing or preparation of any kind would be required; an idea, moreover, which is contradicted by <a href="../../par/1_kings/5-18.htm">1 Kings 5:18</a>. When Gardiner (in Bahr, American edition) quotes Keil (in his earlier work) as understanding "all unviolated stones of the quarry," he hardly does justice to that author, who straightway adds, "that is, not altogether unhewn stones...  but stones that were so hewn and wrought in the quarry that neither hammer," etc. (see below).

The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> is used of quarrying in 1 Kings 5:31 (Heb.) <span class="pc_st_rem">[</span>1 Kings 5:17<span class="pc_st_rem">]</span> Where was this quarry? The general idea is that it was in the Lebanon. And it is not to be denied that some of the massive substructions and cornerstones of the temple may have been brought from the mountain, along with the wood; but the bulk of the stone, there can be no doubt, was found much nearer home. Some of it, according to the Mishna (<span class="accented">Middoth</span>, 3:4), came from Bethlehem; but we can hardly be mistaken in believing that for the most part it was quarried in Jerusalem itself, under the very temple rock, and out of the vast caverns recovered some years ago by Dr. Barclay (see his "City of the Great King"), the "Royal Caverns" of Josephus. See "Quart. Journal," Pal. Explor. Fund (No. 7.), pp, 373, 374, and cf. p. 34. There are unmistakable evidences of these extensive caverns having served as a quarry. Not only are the walls cut straight, but rude masses are left here and there to support the roof, and, what is still more convincing, there are stones more or less cut out of the rock, and incisions are made where stones are to be quarried. There was no reason why the workmen should go far afield for stone when they had it, and of very excellent quality, at their own doors]: <span class="cmt_word">so that there was neither hammer</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">and hammers.</span> Keil understands "finished stones of the quarry, and hammer, and axe."

In Palestine, because of the scarcity of timber, no other form is possible.

Bib. 3 p. 1453). It does not <span class="accented">necessarily</span> follow, however, as Fergusson assumes, that the temple followed the tabernacle in this respect.

The word (masculine) is here again used of the entire side structure] <span class="cmt_word">against all the house, five cubits high</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, each story was five cubits (7.5 feet). The three stories would altogether measure fifteen cubits, and of course something must be allowed for joists, floors, etc. The entire height of the side structure (exterior) would consequently be about 18 or 20 cubits. And as the house was internally 30 cubits high, the exterior measurement would probably be about 32 cubits. It has hence been inferred that between the side structure and the top of temple wall there would be a clear space of 12 or 14 cubits, in which the windows were inserted. But this is based on the  assumption that the side structure had a <span class="accented">flat</span> roof, which is by no means certain. If the roof leaned against the walls of the house, with a low pitch, there would still be space amply sufficient for the clerestory windows. Rawlinson's diagram (p. 511), which gives 80 cubits as the height from basement to <span class="accented">ridge of roof</span>, and only allows 20 cubits for height of walls, practically makes the house 20 instead of 30 cubits high, for it is hardly likely that it had an open roof. In fact, we know that it had a cieling (ver. 14), which must have been at the height of 30 cubits (see the diagrams on p. 102. In <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> house and side structure are represented with flat, in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> with ridged or sloping roofs), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>unless there was an upper chamber above the house, as to which see ver. 20. Rawlinson's diagram has this further defect, that he allows nothing for thickness of joists, floors, and cielings. If we allow one cubit for each floor, then, on his plan, there would be little or no room left for the windows. This verse is hardly to be considered as a repetition of ver. 5, the side structure being here mentioned in connexion with its height and the materials used in its construction] <span class="cmt_word">and they rested on</span> [the meaning of the Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5d6;</span> has been much disputed. It is uncertain what is the nominative, Solomon (as in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>), or the "floor" (just referred to in <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>). Gesenius understands the former, and renders, "<span class="accented">he</span> covered the house," etc. Thenius, "<span class="accented">he</span> fastened the floor," etc. Keil adopts the latter alternative, "it held to the house with cedar beams." It may be urged against this rendering (as also against Thenius's) that beams which merely <span class="accented">rested</span> on the walls would hardly <span class="accented">bind</span> or <span class="accented">hold</span> the side structure to the main building. But it is almost impossible to decide between these interpretations. We may either render "he covered," etc. (with Chald., Vulg.) in which case ver. 10 would agree with ver. 9 (each, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, would refer to the roofing; ver. 9 to roof of temple; ver. 10 to roof of side structure and its stories); or we may take the words to mean "it laid hold of, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, rested on] <span class="cmt_word">the house with timber of cedar.</span> At this point the historian interrupts his description of the building to record the gracious promise made to the king during its erection.

To the ancients the square seemed the most appropriate shape to express the idea of moral perfection. The idea of the cube consequently was that of entire completeness, of absolute perfection. A little light is thrown on this subject by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> among the Greeks.

Nic. 1:10, 11, and compare the familiar "<span class="accented">totus teres atque rotundus."</span> The height of the oracle (internally) being only twenty cubits, while that of the house was thirty (ver. 2), several questions of some interest suggest themselves for consideration. It is perhaps  impossible in the present state of our knowledge to arrive at any very positive conclusions, but it may be well, nevertheless, if only to show in how much uncertainty the architecture of the temple is involved, to state them. First among them is this: Was the roof of the temple flat or ridged? (See above on ver. 9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In either case, was the height of thirty cubits, or any uniform height, maintained throughout, or was the roof of the oracle some ten cubits lower than that of the house? The analogy of the tabernacle, of which the temple was a copy, would lead us to suppose that the ridge - if there was a ridge - of the entire building was level and unbroken, though the analogy of the Gothic church, which, we have already seen, is almost a reproduction of the temple, suggests that the oracle (like the chancel, and, it may be added, like the <span class="accented">adytum</span> of Egyptian temples) may possibly have had a lower roof. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> supposing the same height was maintained from end to end, to what use, if any, was the vacant space of ten cubits (15 feet) between cieling and roof of oracle applied? It has been held by some that there was a chamber here, but that it was empty, being formed, in fact, not for use, but in order to procure the cubical shape of the oracle. Others contend that this upper room, or one which ran the entire length of the building, was designed to serve as a receptacle for the reliques of the tabernacle, and they would identify it with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>. (LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>. And untrustworthy as Josephus is when not supported by independent evidence, it is worth mentioning here that beth he and the Talmud "persistently assert that there was a superstructure on the temple equal in height to the lower part" (Fergusson, who, consequently, is of opinion that there undoubtedly was some such superstructure, as in the tomb of Darius, near Persepolis (see Dict. Bib. 3. pp. 1456, 1-457), and that it was used for worship (<a href="../../par/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>), where see note). Bahr, however, argues forcibly against this idea. He says, <span class="accented">inter alia</span>, that there was no approach provided to these chambers; but our account is so manifestly imperfect that this argument is at the best a precarious one. He sees in the "upper chambers" (the Hebrew word is plural) the upper stories of the side structure. He agrees, however, with Ewald that there was a chamber over the oracle, but thinks it was unoccupied. Keil identifies this space with the "upper chambers" of <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-9.htm">2 Chronicles 3:9</a>, and upon the whole this appears to be the most feasible view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> How was the cieling, whether with or without this upper chamber, and whether at the height of twenty or thirty cubits - how was it supported? For "no cedar beam could be laid across a space of twenty cubits without sinking in the centre by its own weight." Fergusson hence argues that the roof must have been carried on pillars - four in the sanctuary and ten in the hall. He remarks that they were used in the house of the Forest of Lebanon, where they were <span class="accented">less</span> suitable than here]: <span class="cmt_word">and he overlaid it</span> [lit. <span class="accented">made it shine</span>] <span class="cmt_word">with pure gold</span> [marg. <span class="accented">shut up</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> <span class="accented">clausit</span>).

The lavish use of gold in the interior of the temple - its weight 600 talents (75,000 lbs.), its value almost incalculable - was not for mere display (for most of it was never seen except by the priests), but was symbolical of light and <span class="accented">purity</span> (<a href="../../par/job/37-22.htm">Job 37:22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/21-18.htm">Revelation 21:18</a>), and stamped the place as the abode of Him who dwelleth in light (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>). See Bahr <span class="accented">in loc.</span> The palace of the Lord must be "exceeding magnifical." The overlaying was not gilding, but <span class="accented">laminae</span> of gold were attached to the woodwork with nails. This art was probably derived from Egypt (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-11.htm">Exodus 25:11, 13</a>). Egyptian figures ornamented with gold plates are found both in the Louvre and British Museum. See Wilkinson, "Ancient Egyptians," 2. p. 233 sqq.) Rawlinson remarks that "such ornamentation was common in Babylon, in Assyria, and in Media." See <a href="../../par/isaiah/46-6.htm">Isaiah 46:6</a>; Herod. 1:98; Layard, 2:264. In addition to the gold, the house was garnished with precious stones (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-6.htm">2 Chronicles 3:6</a>).

What the writer means, supposing the present text to be retained, is, not that Solomon covered the cedar altar with gold, but that he overlaid the (stone?) altar with cedar. It is true the article is wanting, but this may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that the altar is now mentioned for the first time (Keil). It is much more probable, however, that the text has been slightly corrupted. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (Cod. Alex. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), which proves that the Seventy had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> in their text. If so, the absence of the article is at once explained, and an unmeaning repetition in ver. 22 avoided. The mention of the altar - of course it is the altar of <span class="accented">incense</span> that is meant: the altar of burnt sacrifice was outside the building - in connexion with the  oracle is significant. In ver. 22 it is called the "altar that (belonged) to the oracle," because it stood just outside it. In the tabernacle it was placed "before the vail" (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-5.htm">Exodus 40:5, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-18</a>), and it occupied this position because the incense burned upon it was offered before the Invisible Presence within. It is an argument in favour of the textual emendation suggested above that the altar in the tabernacle was of wood (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1</a>), and that Ezekiel speaks of the "altar of wood" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-22.htm">Ezekiel 41:22</a>), the altar of sacrifice being of earth stones (<a href="../../par/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24, 25</a>), or brass (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-1.htm">2 Chronicles 4:1</a>) If we retain the Received Text we are almost compelled to believe that this altar was also of stone, as they would hardly cover a wooden altar with wood.

Gesen. himself (together with Keil, marg., <span class="accented">al</span>.) understands the doors, "he bolted the doors of the oracle," so as to keep them closed, except on the day of atonement. But the literal rendering is, "he carried over with chains of gold before the oracle," where nothing is said of either boards or doors. The more natural interpretation, therefore, would perhaps be: he carried on the gold plates of the house in chains of gold across the partition, and so fastened it to the side walls.

Unlike Ezekiel's cherubim (Ezekiel chs. 1, 10; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/4-7.htm">Revelation 4:7</a>), these had apparently but one face. The cherub was not a simple, but a complex being, having no unalterable and fixed form. See Bahr, Symbolik, 1. pp. 313, 314; Dict. Bib. vol. 1. pp. 301-303.]

Keil, arguing from the analogy of Egyptian temples, contends for two or three rows, but it is doubtful how far the Israelites, notwithstanding their new and intimate relations with the country, would take Egypt and its idolatrous shrines for a model. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/41-18.htm">Ezekiel 41:18</a> tends to show that the palm trees alternated with the cherubs. The cherubim may have had two faces, such as he describes (ver. 19), the face of a man on the one side, and the face of a young lion on the other side; but if so, they must have differed in form from those of the oracle. Possibly the open flowers formed a border, or were sculptured in festoons, above, and the gourds (or buds) formed a border below (as in the Kouyunjik slab). But as to this the text is silent. But while we are ignorant of the precise form and of the arrangement of these ornamental carvings, we are not wholly in the dark as to their symbolism. For everything in the temple, we may be sure, had a meaning. Let us inquire, then, into the significance of the cherubim, the palms and the flowers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> <span class="accented">The Cherubim</span> have been regarded by some as symbols of the invisible Godhead, by others as "representations of the heavenly spirits which surround the Lord of glory and set forth psychical life at its highest stage" (Keil); but it seems best to view them as symbols of all animal life, including the highest and perhaps not excluding the thought of Him who is the source and spring of life, the <span class="accented">Anima animantium</span> (cf. ch. 12:28). Hence they are spoken of as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-5.htm">Ezekiel 1:5, 13, 15</a>, etc.) "the living things" (compare <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;</span>, <a href="../../par/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6, 8, 9</a>), and even as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> "the life" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-14.htm">Ezekiel 10:14, 15</a>, etc.) The cherubim consequently speak of the great animal kingdom before its Creator. "Creaturely being reaches its highest degree in those which have an <span class="accented">anima</span>, and among these, the lion, the bull, the eagle, and the man are the highest and most complete" (Bahr). These shapes, accordingly, were not inappropriate or unmeaning in a temple raised by the creature to the glory of the Creator. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Just as the cherubim speak of animal, so do the <span class="accented">Palms</span> of vegetable life. They are "the princes of the vegetable kingdom" (Linnaeus) "Amongst trees there is none so lofty and towering, none which has such a fair majestic growth, which is so evergreen, and which affords so grateful a shade and such noble fruits - fruits which are said to be the food of the blessed in paradise - as the palm" (Bahr), who also adds that it is said to have as many excellent properties as there are days in the year, and cites Humboldt as designating it the "noblest of plants forms to which the nations have always accorded the meed of beauty." Judaea, he further remarks, is the fatherland of the palm, so much so that the palm in later days became the symbol of Palestine (as on the well known coin with the legend <span class="accented">Judaea capta</span>). The palms, therefore, tell of the vegetable world, and of Him who fashioned its noble and graceful forms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> And very similar was the testimony of the <span class="accented">Flowers.</span> "Flowers and bloom have been, from ancient times to our own, the usual symbols of lifefulness .... So then by the flower work, as well as by the cherubim and the palm trees, was the dwelling of Jehovah, which was adorned therewith, designated as an <span class="accented">abode of life"</span> (Bahr). On the earthly dwelling place of the Eternal, that is to say, were everywhere pourtrayed the various tokens of His Almighty power and goodness. And the significance of each is the same. "Thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and  were created." They were graved] <span class="cmt_word">within and without.</span> [These words, here and in ver. 30, are generally taken to mean "in the oracle and in the house." But it is worthy of consideration whether they do not rather signify, "in the house and in the porch."

Rawlinson: "the lintel was one-fifth of wall, and each door post one-fifth of its height;" in which case the doorway would of course be a square of four cubits. But perhaps the rendering of A.V. (with which Keil and Bahr also agree) is more natural. The meaning, consequently, would be that the entrance to the oracle, inclusive of the side posts which helped to form it, occupied one-fifth of the extent of the cedar partition.

If the <span class="accented">floors</span> were covered with gold, we may be sure both <span class="accented">walls</span> and <span class="accented">doors</span> would not be without their coating of the precious metal. Our author does not mention the curtain - it is clear that the doors would not dispense with the necessity for a vail - but the chronicler does (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-14.htm">2 Chronicles 3:14</a>). It was necessary in order to cover the ark (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-3.htm">Exodus 40:3, 21</a>); hence it was sometimes called "the vail of the covering." But for this, when the doors were opened on the day of atonement, the priest in the holy place might have gazed into the oracle. See on 1 Kings 8:8. The doors opened outwardly (into the house).

Our author does not mention this, but the chronicler does, under the name of "the great court." In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, the former is called the "higher court," because it occupied a higher level] <span class="cmt_word">with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams.</span> [These, it is thought, formed the enclosing <span class="accented">wall</span> of the court (the LXX. adds <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). The cedar beams were instead of coping stones. It has been supposed, however (J.D. Michaelis), that these three rows of stone, boarded with cedar, formed the <span class="accented">pavement of</span> the court. But the question at once suggests itself, Why pile three rows of stones one upon another merely to form a pavement, and why hew and shape them if they were to be concealed beneath a stratum of wood? It is a fair inference from <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-3.htm">2 Chronicles 7:3</a>, that the wall was low enough to permit men to look over it. Fergusson, on the contrary, argues that it must have been <span class="accented">twice</span> the height of the enclosure of the tabernacle, which would give us an elevation of ten cubits (<a href="../../par/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>). It is worth suggesting, however, whether, the inner court being raised above the outer, which surrounded it, these stones may not have formed the retaining wall or sides of the platform. As the outer court had gates (<a href="../../par/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-9.htm">2 Chronicles 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-8.htm">2 Chronicles 24:8</a>), it also must have had walls. From <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-11.htm">2 Kings 23:11</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/35-2.htm">Jeremiah 35:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10</a>, we gather that there were various chambers in the forecourt. Such were certainly contemplated by David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-12.htm">1 Chronicles 28:12</a>); but it is not recorded that Solomon built them. Nor have we any warrant, except the bare assertion of Josephus, for the belief that he built a colonnade or cloister on the east side, such as was known to later ages by the name of "Solomon's Porch" (<a href="../../par/john/10-23.htm">John 10:23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-12.htm">Acts 5:12</a>). As to the dimensions of these spaces, we are left to conjecture. If, as in everything else, the dimensions of the tabernacle were doubled, then the court of the priests would measure 200 cubits from east to west, and 100 cubits from north to south. It should be stated, however, that in the temple of Ezekiel, the proportions of which, in the present instance, may well he historical, both courts are represented as perfect squares. Rawlinson inadvertently puts down the length (along the side of temple) at 100 cubits, and the breadth (ends of temple) at 200. The outer court would probably be twice as large as the inner, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, 400 x 200 cubits. But all this is necessarily uncertain.]

The close connexion which exists in the original is interrupted by the division of chapters. In <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a> we read, "So was he seven years in building it." <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-1.htm">1 Kings 7:1</a> then proceeds, "And he was building his  own house thirteen years." The much longer period occupied in the erection of the royal palace is easily accounted for. In the first place, the buildings were much larger, and the undertaking altogether was a much more extensive one (ver. 2). Then, though seven years only were consumed in the actual building of the temple, yet preparations for the work had been made, both by David and Solomon, for a long time beforehand. Lastly, a special force of labourers would appear to have been employed on the temple, while it is probable that they wrought at the palaces in greatly diminished numbers. So that the longer period spent over his own house does not argue selfishness or worldliness on Solomon's part. On the contrary, it speaks well for his piety that he built the temple first and urged on that sacred work with so much vigour. The thirteen years date from the completion of the seven years of <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>. That is to say, the building of the temple and palace together occupied twenty years, as is expressly stated in <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-10.htm">1 Kings 9:10</a>. It is therefore one of Stanley's reckless statements that the palace "was commenced at the same time as the temple, but not finished till eight years afterwards"], <span class="cmt_word">and he finished all his house.</span> [By Solomon's "house" we are not to understand his private palace, or residence proper, alone (see ver. 8), but a range of palaces, more or less connected including the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (ver. 2), "the porch of pillars" (ver. 6), the throne-room or judgment hall (ver. 7), his own house and the house of Pharaoh's daughter (ver. 8). That all these are comprehended under the term "house" is evident from <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-1.htm">1 Kings 9:1, 10, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-12.htm">1 Kings 10:12</a>, where Solomon's buildings are always spoken of as <span class="accented">two</span>, viz., "the house of the Lord" and the "king's house." The situation of this string of palaces is by no means certain. Josephus says it stood over against (or opposite) the temple, which is highly probable; but this still leaves the question of site open, for the palace would be justly described as <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, whether it stood west or south of the sanctuary. Ewald places it on the opposite ridge of Ophel, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, on the south prolongation of the temple mount; while Fergusson, Bahr, etc., locate it on the northeast side of Zion, on the opposite side of the Tyropoean valley, and overlooking it and the whole city of David. Recent explorations seem to favour Ewald's view. See "Recovery of Jerusalem," pp. 319 sqq, and "Our Work in Palestine," p. 159 sqq. When we remember that the very site of <span class="accented">Zion</span> is disputed, it will not surprise the reader that questions of this kind should be involved in uncertainty. And when it is further considered that the accumulated <span class="accented">debris</span> of Jerusalem at one point reaches a depth of 120 feet, it will be readily understood what obstacles stand in the way of their settlement.]

It does not follow that this space of 100 x 50 cubits was all roofed in, for it would seem as if the house was built round a courtyard. Rawlinson remarks that a roof of 75 feet is "much greater than is ever found in Assyria." But it is by no means certain that there <span class="accented">was</span> any such roof here], <span class="cmt_word">and the height thereof thirty cubits</span> [the same as the temple], <span class="cmt_word">upon four rows of cedar pillars</span> [How these were disposed of, or what was their number, it is impossible to say. Thenius says they were 400, but this is pure conjecture. The description is so meagre and partial that it is impossible to form a correct idea of the building. The remark made above (ch. 6. Introd. Note) as to the temple applies with still greater force to the palaces. "There are few tasks more difficult or puzzling than the attempt to restore an ancient building of which we possess nothing but two verbal descriptions; and these difficulties are very much enhanced when one account is written in a language like Hebrew, the scientific terms in which are, from our ignorance, capable of the widest latitude of interpretation, and the other, though written in a language of which we have a more definite knowledge, was composed by a person who could never have seen the building he was describing" (Fergusson, Dict.

[This palace, according to Fergusson, was "the great hall of state and audience" and the principal building of the range. But if it was this, which is very doubtful, for the throne was in the hall of judgment (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7</a>), it would seem to have served other purposes besides that of an audience-chamber. Among other things, it was certainly an armoury (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>. cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). The Arab. Vers. calls it "the house of his arms." Possibly it was also the residence of the  bodyguard (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/14-28.htm">1 Kings 14:28</a> with 1 Kings 10:17). Bahr observes that the arrangement of the palaces accords with the Jewish conceptions of the kingly office. The first, the armoury, represents him in his militant character (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>), the second in his judicial function (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>), while the third shows him in his private capacity.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/7-3.htm">1 Kings 7:3</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>it was</i> covered with cedar above upon the beams, that <i>lay</i> on forty five pillars, fifteen <i>in</i> a row.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it was covered</span> [or roofed] <span class="cmt_word">with cedar above</span> [cf. 6:9, 15] <span class="cmt_word">upon the beams</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> lit<span class="accented">., ribs</span>, the word used in <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a> of the <span class="accented">side chambers</span>, and in 1 Kings 6:34 (in the masculine) of the <span class="accented">leaves</span> of the doors], <span class="cmt_word">that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.</span> [Rawlinson, <span class="accented">al</span>. are much exercised <span class="cmt_word">to</span> reconcile this statement with that of ver. 2, which speaks of <span class="accented">four</span> rows, But the explanation is very simple, viz., that the "forty-five, fifteen in a row" does not refer to the pillars but to the side chambers or compartments (A.V., "beams"). The description is so very loose and general that positive statements are out of place, but the meaning certainly appears to be this, that there was a roofing of cedar over the <span class="accented">side chambers</span> (which rested upon the pillars mentioned in ver. 2) <span class="accented">forty-five in</span> number, fifteen in a row. It is true the Masoretic punctuation is against this view. It is also clear that the LXX. understood the numbers forty-five and fifteen to refer to the pillars, for they have essayed to cut the knot by reading <span class="accented">three</span> rows instead of "four rows," in ver. 2. Similarly the Arab. in ver. 3 reads <span class="accented">sixty</span> instead of forty-five; obviously another desperate attempt to solve the difficulty by a corruption of the text. But the solution suggested above is so simple and natural that we can hardly be wrong in adopting it. Bahr says positively that forty-five pillars could not have supported a structure 100 cubits by 50 cubits, "nor could the building have been named ' forest of Lebanon' from forty-five scattered pillars." It would follow hence, that there were side chambers only on three sides of the building, as was the case in the temple. And if (as has been inferred from vers. 4, 5) a three-storied structure is here described; if, that is to say, the forty-five chambers were divided fifteen to a tier or story, it is highly probable that they would be distributed six to each long side and three to the rear (Bahr). This arrangement - a court surrounded by a colonnade and galleries - is still found in the East; as all travellers know. And in its favour it may be said that it is such as to have been suggested by the plan of the temple. The ground plan is the same, with this difference, that a courtyard occupies the place of the temple proper.]

We should then get the sense of "doors and windows "] were square of beam. [The word translated "windows" in ver. 4; the proper rendering is <span class="accented">beam</span>, and the meaning apparently is that all these openings were square in shape. Nothing is said about the height of the rooms, and as the commentators are not agreed whether there was one story or three, that can obviously be only matter of conjecture. Rawlinson, who thinks of but one hall, with three rows of windows, supposes, after Houbigant, that one row was placed in a wall which ran down the middle of the apartment. Such an arrangement, he observes, was found by Layard at Nimrud.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof <i>was</i> fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch <i>was</i> before them: and the <i>other</i> pillars and the thick beam <i>were</i> before them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he made a porch of pillars</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">the porch of pillars.</span> This was no doubt a covered colonnade, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, it had a roof but no sides. The pillars were its only walls. But here the question presents itself, Was this porch the vestibule of the house of the forest of Lebanon, just described? From the correspondence between its width and that of this palace, Rawlinson infers that it was (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2, 3</a>). Bahr believes it to have been the porch or entrance to the hall of judgment mentioned in the next verse,  while Fergusson again assigns it an independent position, separate from either. The <span class="accented">term porch</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>), the meaning of which is surely determined by its use in ch. 6, almost implies that it must have served as the entrance or vestibule to some building. But the size, and the fact that it had itself a porch (see below), favour the idea that it was an independent structure, though Rawlinson shows that "most of the Persepolitan porches had small pillared chambers at some little distance in front of them," and refers to the Egyptian <span class="accented">propylaea</span>. Keil argues that this <span class="accented">pillar hall</span>, as he calls it, stood between the house of the forest of Lebanon and the judgment hall. Bahr, as remarked above, sees in it the anterior part of the judgment hall, which latter, he adds, bore to it the same relation that the oracle did to the temple house. He observes that as the ark was in the oracle, so the throne (<a href="../../par/1_kings/10-18.htm">1 Kings 10:18</a>) found a place in the hall of judgment. This structure, therefore, with its porch, mentioned presently, would reproduce the main features of the temple arrangement. We see, consequently, that both the house of the forest of Lebanon and the porch of pillars followed in their outline the ground plan of the temple. Nor is this at all surprising, considering that all these edifices probably had the same architect or designer]; <span class="cmt_word">the length thereof was fifty cubits</span> [the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the view last advanced of the two divisions of the building, viz., the porch of pillars and the porch of judgment. But the correspondence of the length (or width - the same word is used of the width of the <span class="accented">temple</span> porch <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>) of this porch with the width of the house of the forest of Lebanon is, to say the least, remarkable, and suggests that after all it may have been the porch of that building. If so, the resemblance to the temple would be still more striking], <span class="cmt_word">and the breadth</span> [depth?] <span class="cmt_word">thereof thirty cubits: and</span> <span class="cmt_word">the porch</span> [Heb. a porch] <span class="cmt_word">was before them</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the pillars.

Keil thinks the ceiling served as the floor of an upper story, built over the porch of judgment, but, as Bahr observes, no such upper story is even hinted at elsewhere. It seems to me that, on the whole, the A.V. rendering is to be retained, the meaning being that the whole space, both of wall and cieling, from one side of the floor to the opposite side, was covered with cedar.]

Cf. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/6-28.htm">Jeremiah 6:28</a>. From <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/2-14.htm">2 Chronicles 2:14</a> we learn that Hiram was "skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber," etc. From the mention of brass only in this passage, and in ver. 45, it has been somewhat hastily concluded that "the work that he personally did for Solomon" was "limited to works in brass" (Rawlinson). It is, perhaps, safer to say that brass only is mentioned here, because the following section treats exclusively of the brazen ornaments, etc., of the sanctuary (Keil). It would almost seem, however (see note on ver. 48), as if he was not employed to make the vessels of gold.

In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15</a> the height is given as thirty-five cubits - a discrepancy which has been variously explained.

Others think it a part of that systematic reduplication of the heights of edifices by the chronicler, of which we have already had an instance in ch. 6. (where see note). But the true explanation would seem to be that, by a clerical error, thirty-five (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>) has been substituted in the text for eighteen (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>).

[It must not be supposed, from the fact that the height of the one column is given, and the circumference of the other, that they were dissimilar in height and breadth or girth. There has probably been an accidental abbreviation of the full expression, "Eighteen cubits was the height of the one pillar, and eighteen cubits was the height of the other pillar; and a line of twelve cubits compassed the one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits compassed the other pillar." It is just possible, however, that the peculiarity results from the actual system of  measurement employed in this case. As they were castings, it would be needless to measure both pillars, and so the length may have been ascertained from the first, and the breadth from the second. The columns would thus be about twenty-seven feet high, and about six feet in diameter.]

See note on ver. 19. But it is not a fatal objection to the latter view that it would make the entire chapiter, or both members, nine cubits high; no less, that is, than one-half the length of the shaft. No doubt to modern ideas this appears wholly disproportionate; but a double chapiter, bearing the same proportion to the shaft, is found in some of the buildings of Persepolis (Fergusson,. Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1457). From the expression of vers. 41, 42, "the bowls of the chapiters" (cf. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-12.htm">2 Chronicles 4:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-23.htm">Jeremiah 52:23</a>), and the word "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span>) in ver. 20, we gather that the chapiters were bowl shaped, or bellied out something like the so called "cushion capital" in Norman architecture.

And were they architectural or monumental? Did they support the roof of the porch, or were they isolated and detached, after the manner of obelisks? I incline to the opinion of Bahr, that they stood <span class="accented">in</span> the porch, but that they formed no part of the building, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that they were not for any structural use, but simply for ornament. This appears to me, on the whole, to result from the following considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The language used favours a position within the porch. We have here <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5bb;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (  =  "<span class="accented">at</span> or <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="accented">the</span> porch," perhaps for the porch, as Bahr), and in ver. 19 (where see note) <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. And with this agree the expression of the Chronicles "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the house," and "before (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>) the temple" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-15.htm">2 Chronicles 3:15, 17</a>). The pillars would, however, be "before the temple," whether they stood within or in front of the porch, and it may be safely allowed that the language of the historian is not <span class="accented">decisive</span> one way or the other. The prepositions of the text, however, seem to lend some support to Bahr's view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> We know that the Phoenicians used <span class="accented">isolated</span> metal columns as sacred ornaments, so that Hiram would be familiar with such a mode of ornamentation" (Rawlinson). "Whenever in coins or histories we get a  representation of a Phoenician temple, it always has a pillar or pillars standing within or before it" (Stanley). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> It is extremely doubtful whether these columns, twenty-three feet in height, were adapted to serve as supports to the roof of the porch. The height of the latter has been variously estimated at twenty, thirty, and sixty cubits, and whichever estimate is preferred, the columns would appear to be of an unsuitable altitude. Fergusson says they <span class="accented">were</span> "appropriate to support the roof of the porch," but then he conceives the columns to be in all twenty-seven cubits high (see on ver. 19), and allows the remaining three cubits for the slope of the roof). But, as we cannot be certain either of the height of the porch or of the column, this is an argument of which very little can be made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> If the pillars were part of the building, they would almost certainly have been of the same material, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, wood or stone. Their metallic composition is certainly an argument for their monumental character. It can hardly be alleged in favour of this view, however, that they are mentioned amongst the vessels or articles of furniture, for the historian might fittingly describe the pillars here, as being the principal of the "works in brass" which Hiram wrought, even if they did form the supports of the roof of the porch. Nor are we justified, considering the extreme brevity and the partial character of the description of the temple, in affirming that they would have been mentioned in connexion with the building, had they formed part of the edifice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The remark of Stieglitz (cited by Bahr) that "it was their separate position alone which gave these pillars the impressive aspect they were designed to wear," lends some little support to this view. So also does <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> The fact that these columns and these alone, received special names. "No architectural portion of the building received a name" (Keil). But this argument, again, is not too unduly pressed, for to some it may seem that the names they bore would have a special propriety and an enhanced significance, if the columns contributed to the <span class="accented">strength and stability</span> of the edifice. The question, therefore, is one of considerable complexity, the more so, as it is maintained that it would be almost impossible to construct a roof thirty feet in width without some such pillars to support the beam (Fergusson); but the balance of evidence appears to favour the view that Jachin and Boaz were monuments erected in the porch, to dignify the sanctuary, and to symbolize the power and eternity of the Being to whom it was dedicated]: <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin</span> [<span class="accented">i.e., he shall establish</span>, as marg. The name expressed the belief that God would preserve and protect the new lane.

Ewald suggests that they were named after "some favourites of the time, perhaps young sons of Solon on." The idea of Thenius that these names were engraved upon the pillars is not wholly improbable, though of course it finds no support in the text] <span class="cmt_word">and he set up the left pillar</span> [the left as one faced them from the house.

The thought of Jachin, "<span class="accented">He</span> will establish," is thus continued; and the two pillars pointed alike to the God of Israel as the true support and upholder of His sanctuary. The LXX. interpretation of these two names, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/3-17.htm">2 Chronicles 3:17</a>), <span class="accented">success</span> and <span class="accented">strength</span>, though very far from literal, preserves their fundamental ideas.

See note on ver. 20. Keil says the feet of the oxen no doubt rested on a metal plate, so that they were fixed and immoveable; but this lacks proof. The oxen would be immovable in any case, owing to the weight of the metal and the water. All conjectures as to the height and size of the oxen are necessarily of little value.

This may have resulted, as Keil thinks, from confounding <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> but it is suspicious that so many of the numbers of the Chronicles are exaggerations. The common explanation of the discrepancy, viz., that it held 2000 baths "when filled to its ordinary height, but when filled to the brim 3000" (Wordsworth), appears to me hardly ingenuous] baths. ["The data for determining the value of the bath or ephah are both scanty and conflicting" (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1741). Josephus, the only authority on the subject, says that it equalled the Attic <span class="accented">metretes</span> (about 8.5 gals.), but it is very doubtful whether he was "really familiar with the Greek measures" (<span class="accented">ib.</span>) At any rate, if this statement is correct, his other statement as to the shape of the laver must be altogether erroneous, since 2000 baths would equal 17,000 gals., and a hemispherical laver could not possibly have contained more than 10,000. The attempt has been made, on the assumption that the sea was a hemisphere, as Josephus affirms, to calculate from its capacity the value of the bath, which in that case would be about four gallons. But there is good reason for doubting whether the laver was hemispherical - such a shape would be ill adapted to its position on the backs of oxen - and some have maintained that <span class="cmt_word">it</span> was cylindrical, others that, like the laver of the tabernacle, it had a foot (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-18.htm">Exodus 30:18</a>) or basin. The prevailing opinion of scholars, however, appears to be that it was 30 cubits in circumference only at the lip, and that it bellied out considerably below. While the shape, however, must remain a matter of uncertainty, we are left in no doubt as to its purpose. It was "for the priests to wash in" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/4-6.htm">2 Chronicles 4:6</a>) - not, of course, for immersing their whole persons, but their hands and feet (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-19.htm">Exodus 30:19, 21</a>). The priests (after <a href="../../par/exodus/3-5.htm">Exodus 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/5-15.htm">Joshua 5:15</a>, etc.) ministered barefoot. It was, according to Rabbinical tradition, provided with taps or faucets (Bahr). It has, however, been held by some that the water issued forth (as in the Alhambra) from the lions' mouths. It is probable that a basin of some sort was attached to it. Whether the laver was filled by the hand or by some special contrivance, it is quite impossible to say. We know that provision was made for storing water hard by. The present writer was privileged in 1861 to explore the great reservoir, the <span class="accented">Bahr el Khebir</span>, still existing underneath the Haram area, at a time when very few Europeans had seen it (see Pal. Explor. Fund, No. 7; Barclay, "City of the Great  King;" Porter, Handbook, 1. pp. 134, 138). The water was probably brought from Solomon's pools at Bethlehem, though "a fountain of water exists in the city and is running unto this day, far below the surface" ("Our Work in Palestine," p. 103).

These are questions which we cannot perhaps answer with absolute certainty, but, to my mind, every consideration is in favour of the date first mentioned, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the seventh month of the eleventh year of Solomon's reign. It is true Bahr says that this opinion "needs no refutation," while Keil pronounces it directly at variance with  <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>." But it is worth while to inquire whether this is so? And, first, as to the bearing of the passage just cited, "So was ended all the work which," etc., taken in connexion with <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-1.htm">1 Kings 8:1</a>, "Then Solomon assembled," etc. To the cursory reader it appears no doubt as it this "then" must refer to the completion of the work of which we have just heard, and which was not effected until the eighth month of the year (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>). But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;</span> though probably a mark of time (  =  tune), is clearly a word of great latitude of meaning, and may apply as well to one month before completion (the time specified in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>) as to eleven months after; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it would be quite consistent with the <span class="accented">usus loquendi</span> of the sacred writers to describe the temple as finished, when in reality it was incomplete in a few minor particulars (<span class="accented">De minimis non curat scriptura</span>). Further more, if the temple was finished in every detail, and in all its furniture and appointments, in the eighth month, as we learn from <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, we may be perfectly sure it would or could be <span class="accented">practically</span> finished - finished so as to be ready for consecration - by the seventh month. Indeed, it is not an unreasonable presumption, that it hardly would be perfect and complete on the day of dedication. Those who have built or restored churches, not to speak of cathedrals, which would perhaps afford a closer analogy to the temple, know how extremely difficult, if not impossible, it is to have every detail finished and arranged for the day of consecration. Some few accidental omissions will have to be supplied afterwards, or experience will suggest certain alterations and improvements which have to be made. There is no inherent improbability, therefore, that the temple should be dedicated in the seventh month, though it was not finished <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> until the eighth month, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, three or four weeks later. And there was a strong reason why the dedication should take place at the earliest possible date. There had been a long period of preparation, extending back into the preceding reign (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28.htm">1 Chronicles 28, 29</a>.); the dedication consequently had long been eagerly looked for; moreover the erection had evidently been hurried forward, a prodigious number of labourers having been employed in order to expedite the work. It is almost inconceivable, therefore, that, after these energetic measures had been taken, either the king or the nation should have been content to wait thirteen years - nearly twice the time it had taken to build the temple - until the palaces, which were entirely independent and secular buildings, were also completed. If the great national sanctuary, which was the glory of the land, was ready for use, as we know it was, we  can hardly believe, considering the natural eagerness and impatience of men, that the tribes of Israel, or their ambitious monarch, would, of their own choice, defer the consecration for an indefinite number of years. It would appear consequently that it is the view that the dedication was postponed for thirteen years "hardly needs discussion" (see below on 1 Kings 9:1). And the same considerations apply, though perhaps with diminished force, to their waiting one year. For if it be said that the delay was occasioned by the desire to connect the dedication with the feast of tabernacles, which was <span class="accented">par excellence</span> the feast of the year (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;</span>) the answer is that it is more likely that the work would be hurried on by the employment of additional hands, if need be, or that the edifice would be consecrated, though not complete in all its details, at the feast of the eleventh year, than that, for the sake of one month, they should wait eleven months. And if the objection be raised that a feeling of religious awe would forbid the dedication of an imperfect building, or of a perfect building with imperfect arrangements, it is easy to reply that both building and furniture may have been practically complete, and may have been believed at the time to be perfect, but that the experience of the first few days suggested a few alterations or additions which threw the completion of the work in all its particulars into the eighth month. It is worthy of notice that Josephus distinctly states that the dedication was in the seventh month of the eighth year (Ant. 8:04. 1) ] <span class="cmt_word">Solomon assembled</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. See Ewald, 233 <span class="accented">b</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the chief</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">princes</span>] <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the fathers of the children of Israel</span>. [This great assembly (compare <a href="../../par/daniel/3-2.htm">Daniel 3:2</a>) can hardly be said to have been suggested to Solomon by the precedent afforded by David (Keil), when bringing up the ark (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>), for it was only natural that he should summon the representatives of the people to witness an event of such profound importance in the national history, as the dedication, after years of waiting (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-6.htm">2 Samuel 7:6-13</a>), of a national sanctuary intended to supersede the tabernacle, at which for five centuries their forefathers had worshipped. And the more so, as they had been called together by David to con-salt about the erection (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/28-1.htm">1 Chronicles 28:1</a>), and had offered willingly of their treasures (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-6.htm">1 Chronicles 29:6-9</a>) towards its decoration. It is inconceivable, therefore, that the temple of the Jews could have been formally opened, except in the presence of the "elders and heads of the tribes." Nor can we (with Rawlinson) see a contrast between the more popular proceedings of David, who "gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, <span class="accented">thirty thousand</span> (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/6-1.htm">2 Samuel 6:1</a>), and the statelier, more aristocratic system of his son, who merely summons the chief men;" for Solomon's "eiders," etc. (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-4.htm">1 Samuel 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26-31</a>), may well have equalled David's "chosen men" in number. It is quite likely that there was more formality and stateliness in this latter ease, but it was practically the same class of persons, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the leading men by birth, talents, or prowess, that were present on both occasions. In fact, it was the Jewish Church by representation] <span class="cmt_word">unto King Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">to bring up</span>] <span class="cmt_word">the ark of the covenant of the Lord</span> [so called because it contained the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with the children of Israel (ver. 9).

The same word is used of the feast of passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>) and pentecost (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 16), but "the feast" here can only mean that of tabernacles. As the "feast of ingathering" (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), as commemorating the deliverance from Egypt (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>), and as peculiarly a social festival (<span class="accented">ib</span>. vers. 40-42; <a href="../../par/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12</a> sqq.), it was the most joyous as well as the greatest (?Jos., Ant. 8:04. 1) gathering of the year. (Compare the Jewish saying of a later date: "He who has never seen the rejoicing at the pouring out of the water of Siloam, has never seen rejoicing in his life.") It was doubtless for this reason that tabernacles was selected for the dedication. A special feast of dedication, however, was held for seven days before the feast of tabernacles proper commenced (see on ver. 65). It did not displace that great feast, however (Stanley), but simply preceded it. It is worthy of notice that Jeroboam selected the same feast (<a href="../../par/1_kings/12-32.htm">1 Kings 12:32</a>) for the inauguration of his new cultus.

But there is no contradiction, as has been too readily supposed. For ver. 7 of the Chronicles," <span class="accented">the priests</span> brought in the ark," etc., confirms the statement of the text. And the explanation is suggested in ver. 5 of the same chapter, "These did the priests, the Levites (so the Heb.) bring up." Same expression in <a href="../../par/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3</a>. All the priests were Levites - Keil translates, "the Levitical priests" - and this somewhat singular expression is no doubt used to remind us that such was the case. Nor need it cause us any surprise to find the priests employed in this service. It is true that the ark was given into the charge of the Kohathite Levites (<a href="../../par/numbers/3-30.htm">Numbers 3:30, 31</a>); and it was their duty to bear it (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/10-21.htm">Numbers 10:21</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 11, 12</a>). But the real care and supervision of the ark always belonged to the sons of Aaron. It was their office, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, to put on or take off the covering of the ark and of the vessels, which the Levites were forbidden directly to touch (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>). It was quite in accordance with the <span class="accented">spirit</span> of these provisions that Solomon now entrusted the carriage of the ark to the superior order. But more than that, Solomon was not without precedent to justify his choice, indeed, we may see in his selection of the priests a minute mark of truth, amounting almost to an undo-signed coincidence. For we find that on occasions of extraordinary solemnity - at the crossing of the Jordan, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, (<a href="../../par/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6, 15, 17</a>), and at the siege of Jericho (<a href="../../par/joshua/6-6.htm">Joshua 6:6</a>), the <span class="accented">priests</span> had borne the ark (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/15-11.htm">1 Chronicles 15:11, 12</a>). It was no doubt these familiar precedents guided Solomon, or the ecclesiastical authorities, in their selection of the priests on this occasion. A "settled place," a "house of cedars" (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-7.htm">2 Samuel 7:7</a>), "having now been found for the ark" to abide in, after it had "dwelt in curtains" for 500 years, it was taking its last journey, and in order to mark this journey as exceptional, in order to show both the ark and the house the greater reverence, it was determined that it should be borne for the last time by the priests. Keil suggests that the ark may have been uncovered, but this is very improbable. Why, we may ask, were coverings provided, and their use prescribed (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-5.htm">Numbers 4:5-15</a>), if they were to be arbitrarily dispensed with? He also adds that Levites were not allowed to enter the most holy place. But neither, it may be added, was this lawful for the priests. Levites and priests might enter that day, because the house was not then dedicated. The cloud (ver. 10) claimed it for God.

There may have been also in the background the idea of averting the Divine anger, of making a propitiation for possible errors and imperfections in their service.

If we adhere to the A.V. then we must understand that, as it was forbidden to remove the staves from the rings at the corners of the ark (<a href="../../par/exodus/25-12.htm">Exodus 25:12-15</a>), they drew the staves forward towards one end of the ark; that they removed the staves altogether from the ark (Stanley) is a view to which the text lends no support] <span class="cmt_word">the staves, that the ends</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">heads</span>.

Several questions of considerable nicety suggest themselves here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> What was the position of the ark?

As to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> the balance of evidence is in favour of the ark having stood north and south, in a line, that is, with the wings of the cherubim. For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> only thus apparently could the cherubim have "covered the ark <span class="accented">and the staves thereof</span>." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> If it had been otherwise, the "cherubim overshadowing the mercy seat," presuming that they were retained in the temple, would have had an unequal and one-sided position, for instead of being equally prominent, they would have stood, one with the back, the other with the face to the entrance and the holy place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Had the ark stood east and west the projecting staves would surely have been in the high priest's way in the performance of his solemn functions (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-15</a>).

It follows hence again that they cannot have been more than eight or nine cubits long, inasmuch as they found a place between the bodies of the cherubim, which cannot have been more than nine cubits apart. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The explanation of the Rabbins is that the ends of the staves were not really <span class="accented">seen</span>, but that they projected into the curtain and so made two visible protrusions or prominences. But this view hardly satisfies the requirements of the text, and it assumes that the ark stood east and west, which we have found good reason to doubt. But even if this were so, it is doubtful  whether the staves, so long as they remained in the rings, could be made to reach to the door of the oracle, unless indeed they were lengthened for the purpose. How then were they seen? The following considerations may assist us to answer this question. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The oracle, of course, in its normal state was in perfect darkness (ver. 12). Once a year, however, a gleam of light was admitted, when the curtain was drawn partially aside to permit of the high priest's entrance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When the curtain was drawn to one (probably the left) side, the light would fall, not on the ark, but on the ends of the staves projecting from the right or north end of the ark, which would thus be distinctly visible to the high priest. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> at this time the high priest was not alone in the holy place. It was not required that "there should be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation," except when the high priest went in to make an atonement for the <span class="accented">holy place</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-17.htm">Leviticus 16:17</a>). At an earlier stage of the service he would seem to have required assistance. According to the Mishna (Yoma), a priest held the basin of blood and stirred it to prevent coagulation, at the time of his first entry. Moreover <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> his extremely doubtful whether the high priest can have drawn aside the curtain himself. Whether he entered three or four times on that day, at his first entry his hands were certainly full. If he carried "a censer full of burning coals of fire".. "and his hands (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span>, <span class="accented">both</span> fits) full of sweet incense beaten small" (<span class="accented">ib</span>. ver. 12), it is clear that some other person must have drawn aside the veil for him. It is to this person, I take it, the priest who was privileged to draw aside the curtain, and possibly to others standing near - certainly to the high priest - that the ends of the staves were visible. Nor would a reverent look directed towards these objects - made originally for the Levites to handle - involve unhallowed curiosity. And if this were so, it would help to explain (4) the mention of this circumstance by our author. If it were a fact that year by year a gleam of light fell upon the staves, and if priest after priest testified of what he had seen, up to the time of writing ("unto this day;" see below), we can readily understand why a circumstance of so much interest should be recorded. And we have not an adequate explanation of its mention here, if we are to understand that the staves were seen on the day of dedication, when of course they must have been visible, and never afterwards, or that the staves were partially drawn out of their rings in order to show that the ark was now at rest], <span class="cmt_word">and there they are unto this day.</span> [Same expression <a href="../../par/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/12-19.htm">1 Kings 12:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a>. At the date of the publication of this book, the temple was of course destroyed (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-9.htm">2 Kings 25:9</a>), so that at <span class="accented">that</span> day the staves were not there. But the explanation is very simple. Our historian has copied the words he found in the MS. he was using.]

This statement appears to be at variance with <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>, which mentions "the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded," as in the ark, along with "the tables of the covenant." And it is to be observed that, while our text excludes these relics from the ark (<span class="accented">temp</span>. Solomon), no other scripture save that just cited expressly includes them. In <a href="../../par/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a> and Numbers 17:25 (Heb. A.V., Numbers 17:10) they are commanded to be laid up "before the testimony," words which no doubt may mean, as they were long interpreted to mean, "before the tables of testimony in the ark" - observe, the words are "before the <span class="accented">testimony</span>," not "before the <span class="accented">ark"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> but which are now generally thought to import "in front of the ark which con-rained the testimony." We know the book of the law was put "at the side (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>) of the ark" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>), and hence it is held by some that the golden pot, etc., occupied a similar position. It seems preferable, however, considering the distinct statement of St. Paul, or the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, which, to say the least, embodies Jewish tradition, to adhere to the ancient interpretation that the golden pot of manna and Aaron's rod were in the ark. And this in no wise conflicts with the statement of the text, for these treasures might well have been removed by the Philistines, whose first thought, we may be sure, would be to open their new acquisition. It is not improbable, indeed, that the object of the men of Bethshemesh in looking into the ark was to see whether these treasures were still there. For if the golden pot ever was in the ark, we can hardly suppose it would escape the rapacity of the Philistines, who would leave the two tables of stone as things of no value. Indeed, it is just possible that the trespass offering, the golden mice, etc., were designed as a return for the golden pot which had been removed. And the statement of the text, "there was nothing," etc., almost implies that there had been something there at one time (see Alford on <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). It seem probable, therefore, that the golden pot and Aaron's rod were originally deposited "before the testimony" in the ark; that they were removed during its captivity (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>.);  and that the sacrilege was discovered at Bethshemesh (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). This last mentioned episode explains how it came to be known that "there was nothing," etc. It is hardly likely after that memorable visitation that Solomon could have opened the ark and taken out the two relics, as Rawlinson suggests. Nor have we any warrant for the view that the mercy seat, with the cherubs, was removed to make way for a new lid without them, and so the interior of the ark was disclosed to view (Stanley) ] <span class="cmt_word">at Horeb</span> [See <a href="../../par/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/33-6.htm">Exodus 33:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8</a>.

It is hardly correct to identify the cloud with the Shechinah of the Targums (Rawlinson), for it is noticeable that the Targums never render "the cloud" or "the glory" by "the Shechinah." In fact, as regards the use of the word by Jewish writers, it would seem to be a periphrasis for God (Dict. Bib. 3. p. 1241).

Possibly the priests were about to burn incense. Evidently ministrations of some sort were intended and were interrupted. The exact correspondence with <a href="../../par/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-4.htm">Ezekiel 44:4</a>) is not to be overlooked.

It is certainly noticeable that what ver. 10 says of the cloud - that it "filled the house" - ver. 11 says of the glory. It is also true that there is no mention of any light or fire. And the "darkness" of ver. 12 might naturally seem to refer to the cloud, and therefore to exclude the idea of light. But surely the words <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;</span> are to be interpreted here by their signification and use elsewhere, and we find "the glory of the <span class="accented">Lord</span> elsewhere mentioned as something distinct from the cloud. We must remember that what by day was a pillar of cloud, by night was a pillar <span class="accented">of fire</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21, 22</a>). In <a href="../../par/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9, 16</a>, the mention of the "thick cloud" is followed by the statement that "Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it <span class="accented">in fire"</span> (ver. 18). Similarly, in <a href="../../par/exodus/24.htm">Exodus 24</a>, we are told that "the glory of the Lord appeared upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it (the glory?) six days; and the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud. And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like <span class="accented">devouring fire</span> " (vers. 16, 17). But perhaps the most decisive passage in this connexion is <a href="../../par/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34</a>, where we are <span class="accented">told</span> that "the cloud abode <span class="accented">upon"</span> the tent of meeting, while "the glory of the Lord filled the (interior of the) tabernacle."

It would appear, therefore, that "the glory of the Lord" was not the cloud, but,  as the word almost seems to imply, a "light from heaven above the brightness of the sun" (<a href="../../par/acts/26-13.htm">Acts 26:13</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14, 16</a>). It is hardly necessary to add that the glory, though apparently resident in the cloud, was not always luminous; the cloud veiled it from the eyes of men.

It divides itself into three parts. The first (vers. 22-30) is general; the second (vers. 31-53) consists of seven special petitions; the last (vers. 50-53) consists of a general conclusion and appeal to God's covenant mercy.

A false oath, consequently, dishonoured the Divine name, and polluted the sanctuary dedicated to that name, and if it went unpunished, contradicted the principles and provisions of the dispensation Of temporal punishments, and so encouraged falsehood and impiety. God is here entreated, consequently, to take cognizance of the oaths sworn before His altar (ver. 31), and to be a swift witness against the false swearers (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>). It is, perhaps, because of the direct dishonour which perjury offers to the Divine name that, as Bahr suggests, this prayer stands first among the seven, thus corresponding to the "Hallowed be Thy name" in the Lord's prayer, and to the third among the ten commandments.

The Gentiles who should visit Jerusalem would assuredly, with their polytheistic ideas and their belief in local or tribal deities, invoke the aid and blessing of the mighty God of Jacob. This mention of aliens from the commonwealth of Israel in the prayer of dedication, especially when viewed in the light of the exclusiveness and bigotry which characterized the Jews of later days, is especially to be noticed. As Rawlinson (<span class="accented">in loco</span>) observes, "Nothing is more remarkable in the Mosaic law than its liberality with regard to strangers."

Leer. 26.), are also to be remembered. These new relations with the stranger would no doubt have widened Solomon's views.

It has hence been too readily inferred that this portion of the prayer, at least, if not the preceding petition also, has been interpolated by a post-captivity writer. But there is really no solid reason for doubting its genuineness. Not only is it the <span class="accented">seventh</span> petition (see on ver. 31), but the captivity of Israel had been denounced as the punishment of persistent disobedience long before by Moses, and in the chapters to which such constant reference is made (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33, 44</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25, 36, 64</a>; cf. 4:27) - a fact which is in itself an indirect proof of genuineness, as showing that this petition is of a piece with the rest of the prayer. And when to this we add that the carrying of a conquered and refractory race into captivity was an established custom of the East, we shall be inclined to agree with Bahr, that "it would have been more remarkable if Solomon had not mentioned it."

But surely it is, to say the least, just as likely that the Jews, when the captivity of which Solomon spoke befel them, borrowed the phrase in which their great king by anticipation expressed their penitence. Seeing in the captivity a fulfilment of his prediction, they would naturally see  in this formula, which no doubt had been preserved in the writings of the prophets, a confession specially appropriate to their case, and indeed provided for their use.

He maintains, indeed, that the chronicler contradicts himself, for we can hardly think that the glory which we are told (<a href="../../par/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>) had already filled the house, left it and then returned. It is certainly suspicious, and a much stronger argument against the words in question, that no mention of the fire is made by our author, for, brief as this history is, it is difficult to believe that so signal an interposition could have remained unnoticed, if it really occurred. <span class="cmt_word">SECTION IV.</span> - <span class="accented">The Festal Sacrifices</span>. The ceremonial of dedication was followed, as would naturally be the case, by sacrifices on a scale of unusual grandeur. Apart from their religious use and significance, the sacrifices testified to the devotion of the giver who on this of all days must not appear before the Lord empty, and they also afforded materials for the great and prolonged feast by which this auspicious event in the history of Israel must be commemorated.

In the peace offering, the fat was burnt on the altar, but the flesh was eaten (ver. 15; cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), so that this form of offering was, in every way, adapted to a festival.

For, in the first place, the Chronicles and all the Versions agree with the text, and, secondly, the numbers, compared with what we know of the sacrifices offered on other occasions, are not unduly large, nor were they such that (as has been alleged) it would be impossible to offer them within the time specified. If, at an ordinary Passover a quarter of a million of lambs could be sacrificed within the space of two or three hours (Jos., Bell. Jud. 6:09.8), there can obviously have been "no difficulty in sacrificing 3000 oxen and 18,000 sheep on each of the seven days of the festival" (Keil). (But were not the sacrifices spread over fourteen days? ver. 65.) And it is to be remembered <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that "profusion was a usual feature of the sacrifices of antiquity Sacrifices of a thousand oxen (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) were not infrequent. According to an Arabian historian (Koto beddyn), the Caliph Moktader sacrificed during his pilgrimage to Mecca...  40,000 camels and cows and 50,000 sheep. Tavernier speaks of 100,000 victims as offered by the King of Tonquin" (Rawlinson, Stanley); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the context insists on the ex traordinary number of victims. They were so numerous, we are told, that the brazen altar was quite inadequate to receive them (ver. 64). It has been already pointed out (note on ver. 62) that the people joined the king in the sacrifices. Indeed it is against not only ver. 62, but vers. 63, 65, to suppose that all the victims were offered by Solomon alone (Ewald, Stanley). If these numbers, therefore, include those offered by the people, we can the more readily understand them. For, by the lowest computation, there could hardly be less than 100,000 heads of houses present at the feast (Bahr, Keil), and if the numbers of David's census (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>) may be trusted, there may very well have been four or five times that number, and on such an occasion as that, an occasion altogether without precedent, every Israelite would doubtless offer his sacrifice of thanksgiving - the more so as a large number of victims would be required for the purposes of the subsequent feast. And as to the impossibility of the priests offering so prodigious a number within the specified time (Thenius, <span class="accented">al</span>.), we have only to remember <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that if there were 38,000 Levites (men over thirty years of age) in the time of David (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-3.htm">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>), or any thing like that number, there <span class="accented">must</span> have been at the very least at this period two or three thousand priests (Keil), and we can hardly think that at the dedication of so glorious a temple, in which they were so profoundly interested, many of them would be absent from Jerusalem. But if there were only <span class="accented">one</span> thousand present, that number would have been amply sufficient to perform all the priestly functions. For it was no necessary, part of the priests' office either to slay the victim, or to prepare it for sacrifice - <span class="accented">that</span> any Israelite might do (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5, 6, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>, etc.); the duty of the priest was strictly limited to "sprinkling the blood round about upon the altar" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2, 8</a>; cf. 1:5), and burning the fat, the kidneys, etc., upon the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>). It is clear, consequently, that there is no difficulty whatsoever as to the manual acts required of the priests. It only remains to notice one other objection, viz., that the people could not possibly have eaten all the flesh of these peace offerings. But here again the answer is conclusive, viz. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that it was not necessary that all should be eaten, for the law expressly provided that if any of the flesh remained over until the third day, it should be burnt with fire (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-15.htm">Leviticus 7:15</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-6.htm">Leviticus 19:6</a>), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> no one can say what the number of people may not have been (see below on ver. 65), and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the sacrifices were spread over fourteen days.] <span class="cmt_word">So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.</span>

The chronicler gives the true meaning: "all that came into Solomon's heart." It is, however, somewhat doubtful what works are comprehended under this term. <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-11.htm">2 Chronicles 7:11</a> limits it to the two great erections already described - "all that came into his heart to make <span class="accented">in</span> the house of the Lord and in his own house." But it is by no means certain that our author intended the word to be thus restricted; it is quite possible, <span class="accented">e</span>.<span class="accented">g</span>., that some of the buildings mentioned below (vers. 15-19) are to be included. But another question of much greater importance presents itself here. In the Divine communication of vers. 3-9 there is constant and unmistakeable reference to the prayer of dedication (see especially ver. 3); in fact, this message is the <span class="accented">answer</span> to that prayer. It has been held, consequently, that the answer must have followed, if not immediately, yet soon after the petitions were uttered; if so, the dedication must clearly have taken place, not on the completion of the temple (<a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>), but on the completion of the palace, etc.; in other words, the temple must have been finished fully thirteen years before it was consecrated and occupied. Rawlinson suggests that the delay was perhaps occasioned by the circumstance that the furniture of the temple was not till then ready; but <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-38.htm">1 Kings 6:38</a>, Hebrews, seems to state distinctly that <span class="accented">all</span> the vessels and appointments of the sanctuary were finished at the date there given. Reasons have been given elsewhere (see note on 1 Kings 8:1) in support of the position that the dedication  possibly have been delayed for so long a period, especially after the strenuous efforts which had been made to hurry on the undertaking. Nor does the text, when carefully examined, really require this hypothesis; indeed, it suggests some reasons for thinking that a considerable period must have intervened between the prayer and the response. For the tone of this response is unmistakeably foreboding, if not minatory. Vers. 6-9 contain a stern warning. But there was nothing, so far as we know, in the attitude of Solomon or of Israel at the time of the dedication to call for any such denunciation. At that time, as the prayer surely proves, Solomon's heart was perfect with the Lord his God. But the response has unmistakeably the appearance of having been elicited by signs of defection. The wide difference, consequently, between the spirit of the prayer and the tone of the answer suggests that some time must have elapsed between them, and so far supports the view that the dedication was not delayed until the palace, etc., was completed. And it is also to be remembered that the prayer of dedication had not been without acknowledgment at the time. The excellent glory which filled and took possession of the house was itself a significant and sufficient response. No voice or vision could have said more plainly, "I have heard thy prayer, I have hallowed this house." But when, some thirteen years later - about the very time, that is, when he was at the height of his prosperity, and when, owing to the completion of his undertakings, we might fear lest his heart should be lifted up with pride - when Solomon and his court began to decline in piety and to go after other gods, then this merciful message opportunely refers him to the prayer which he was in danger of forgetting, and warns him of the consequences of the apostasy to which he was tending.]

SOLOMON'S BUILDINGS AND UNDERTAKINGS. - So far the historian has spoken exclusively of the two greatest works of Solomon's reign, the Temple and the Palace, and principally of the former. Even the message just related was, as we have seen, the response to the prayer offered when the temple was consecrated. But he now proceeds to mention other proofs of Solomon's greatness, and of the prosperity of his reign - doubtless because the glory of Israel then reached its climax, and the author would be tempted to linger over these details because of the dark contrast which his own time supplied - and this leads him to speak of the means by which all these enterprises were accomplished. The particulars here given are but fragmentary, and are grouped together in a somewhat irregular manner. It would seem as if both this account and that of the chronicler had been compiled from much more copious histories, each writer having cited those particulars which appeared to him to be the most interesting and important. But the design of the historian in either case is evident, viz., <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to recount the principal undertakings of this illustrious king, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to indicate the resources which   enabled him to accomplish such ambitious and extensive designs.

It has been conjectured that Hiram had hoped for the noble bay of Acco or Ptolemais (Milman, Rawlinson), but surely he had seaboard enough already. It was rather corn lands he would most need and desire. His disappointment is amply accounted for by the fact that the country assigned him was a hungry and mountainous, and therefore comparatively useless, tract.

He does not understand the word, however, as a term of contempt. "How," he asks, "could Hiram give the district a permanent name which contained a mockery of himself rather than of the land?" But the word was obviously an expression of disparagement, if not disgust, which, falling from Hiram's lips, was caught up and repeated with a view to mark not so much his displeasure as Solomon's meanness. But it is not necessary to find a meaning for the word, for it is to be considered that a city Bearing this name existed at that time and in this neighbourhood (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-27.htm">Joshua 19:27</a>), the site of which, in all probability, is marked by the modern <span class="accented">Kabul</span>, eight miles east of Accho  (Robinson, 3:87, 88; Dict. Bib. 1:237; Thomson, "Land and Book," 1:281, 511). It is possible, indeed, that it may have been one of the "twenty cities" (ver. 11) given to Hiram. And if this city, whether within or without the district of Galilee, were notorious for its poverty or meanness, or conspicuous by its bleak situation, we can at once understand why Hiram should transfer the name to the adjoining region, even if that name, in itself, had no special significance] unto this day.

He further sees in the restoration of these cities (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-2.htm">2 Chronicles 8:2</a>, where see note) a proof that Solomon must have repaid the amount lent him.

The import of the word is much disputed, but Wordsworth has but slight warrant for say. ing that it means fortress. According to some it is an archaic Canaanitish term, "adopted by the Israelites when they took the town and incorporated into their own nomenclature" (Dict. Bib. 2. p. 367), an idea which finds some support in <a href="../../par/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>. Mr. Grove would further see in it a name for Mount Zion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> being the invariable designation of that part of the city in the Maccabees. But see Joshua, B. J. 5:04.1; Ant. 15:11.5; and Porter, 1. pp. 96, 109. Lewin ("Siege of Jerusalem," p. 256) identifies it with the great platform on which temple and palace alike were built. But the word yields a definite meaning in the (  =  aolm], "the filling in"). Gesenius Hebrew consequently understands it to mean, a rampart (agger) because this is built up and filled in with stones, earth, etc. And the name would have a special fitness if we might suppose that it was applied to that part of the wall of Jerusalem which crossed the Tyropaeon valley. This ravine, which practically divided the city into two parts, would have been the weakest spot in the line of circumvallation, unless it were partly filled in - it is now completely choked up by debris, etc. - and protected by special fortifications; and, if this were done, and we can hardly doubt it was done (see on 1 Kings 11:27), Hammillo, "the filling in," would be its natural and appropriate name. And its mention, here and elsewhere, in connexion with the wall, lends some support to this view] and the wall of Jerusalem [We learn from <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a> that David had already built Millo and the wall. Rawlinson argues from <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a> that these repairs had been "hasty, and had now - fifty years later - fallen into decay," and that Solomon renewed them. More probably the words indicate an enlargement of the Tyropaeon rampart, and an extension of the walls. See note there and on chap. 3:1. Solomon, no doubt, wished to strengthen the defences of the capital, on which he had expended so much labour, and where there was so much to tempt the rapacity of predatory neighbours] and Hazor [For the defence of the kingdom he built a chain of fortresses "to form a sort of girdle round the land" (Ewald). The first mentioned, Hazor, was a place of great importance in earlier times, being the "head of all those (the northern) kingdoms" (<a href="../../par/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10</a>). It stood on an eminence - as indeed, for the sake of security, did all the cities of that lawless age (ib., ver. 13 marg.) - overlooking Lake Merom. It was at no great distance from the north boundary of Palestine, in Naphtali (<a href="../../par/joshua/19-36.htm">Joshua 19:36</a>), and being favoured by position, it was strongly fortified - Hazor means fortress - and hence Joshua made a point of destroying it. It appears, however, to have speedily regained its importance, for in <a href="../../par/judges/4-2.htm">Judges 4:2, 17</a> we find it as the capital of Jabin, king of Canaan. It was selected by Solomon as the best site for a stronghold, which should protect his northern border, and as commanding the approach from  Syria. As it is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, it would appear to have escaped in the invasion of Benhadad. Possibly it was too strong for him] and Megiddo [<a href="../../par/joshua/12-21.htm">Joshua 12:21</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/17-11.htm">Joshua 17:11</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. This place was chosen partly because of its central position - it stood on the margin of the plain of Esdraelon, the battlefield of Palestine, and the battles fought there prove its strategical importance, <a href="../../par/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a> (cf. <a href="../../par/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1</a>); <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>; Judith 3:9, 10 - and partly, perhaps, because the high road from Egypt to Damascus passed through it. It dominated the passes of Ephraim (see Judith 4:7). It has till recently been identified with el-Lejjun (from Legio. Compare our Chester, etc.) (Robinson, 2:116 sqq.; Stanley, S. and P., p. 347; Porter, 286, 287); but Conder ("Tent-work," p. 67) gives good reasons for fixing the site at the "large ruins between Jezreel and Bethshean, which still bears the name of Mujedd'a, i.e., on the eastern side of the plain] and Gezer [This commanded the approach from Egypt, and would protect the southern frontier of Solomon's kingdom. See <a href="../../par/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/12-12.htm">Joshua 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/21-21.htm">Joshua 21:21</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/1-29.htm">Judges 1:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/5-25.htm">2 Samuel 5:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>. It stands on the great maritime plain, and is also on the coast road between Egypt and Jerusalem. The site was identified (in 1874) by M. Clermont Ganneau with Tell Jezer. The name means "cut off," "isolated" (Gesen.) "The origin of the title is at once clear, for the site is an out-lier - to use a geological term - of the main line of hills and the position commands one of the important passes to Jerusalem" (Conder, p. 6). The mention of Gezer leads to a parenthesis of considerable length (vers. 16-19). The question of the levy is put aside for the time, whilst the historian explains how it was that the king came to build Gezer. He then proceeds to mention the other towns built during the same reign.

Like Megiddo and Gezer, this town, too, lay on a high road, viz., that between Jerusalem and the sea coast. The selection of Beth-horon for fortification by Solomon is also justified by history - three decisive battles having been fought here (see <a href="../../par/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>; 1 Macc. 3:13-24, and Jos., Bell Jud. 2.19.8.

But here it is to be observed that the chronicler omits these words, and that the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate render, "in the land of the wilderness." Keil says our text is manifestly corrupt, and certainly the expression is a singular one. Some would, therefore, alter <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e5;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span>, or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span> (after <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>). Both of the emendations, however, while undoubtedly plausible, are purely conjectural. Wordsworth, who thinks Palmyra is meant, says it is described as "in the land" to indicate that God had fulfilled his promise to extend <span class="accented">the land</span> of Solomon far eastward into the <span class="accented">wilderness</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-9.htm">Psalm 72:9</a>). And a Jewish historian, especially in the time of his country s decadence, might well recount how this great city had once been comprised within the boundaries of Israel. In favour of (2) are these facts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> That it is the reading of the text. It is said, however, that the ancient name of Tadmor was Tamar, and the place clearly owed its name to the <span class="accented">Palm</span> trees. But the name is always <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> in the Palmyrene inscriptions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That this place was "in the wilderness," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, of Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> That it was "in the land," and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that it was in close proximity to the places just mentioned.

This and ver. 25 are not interposed arbitrarily, as might at first sight appear, but refer to <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1-4</a>. The completion of the palaces rendered it no longer necessary or proper that Solomon's daughter should dwell in a separate house. The chronicler tells us that she had dwelt in David's palace on Mount Zion, and that Solomon was constrained to remove her, because he looked upon all the precinct as now consecrated (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-11.htm">2 Chronicles 8:11</a>) ]. <span class="cmt_word">Pharaoh's daughter came up</span> [<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/9-25.htm">1 Kings 9:25</a></div><div class="verse">And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that <i>was</i> before the LORD.

See <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-12.htm">2 Chronicles 8:12</a>. The design of this verse may be to show that there was no longer any offering on high places. It would thus refer to <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2</a>, as ver. 24 to <a href="../../par/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>] <span class="cmt_word">did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord</span> [the chronicler adds, "before the porch"], <span class="cmt_word">and he burnt incense.</span> [It has been supposed by some that Solomon sacrificed and burnt incense <span class="accented">propria manu</span>. According to Dean Stanley ("Jewish Ch." 2. pp. 220, 221), "he solemnly entered, not only the temple courts with sacrifices, but penetrated into the Holy Place itself, where in later years none but the priests were allowed to enter, and offered incense on the altar of incense." But this positive statement is absolutely destitute of all basis. For, in the first place, there is nothing in the text to support it. If Solomon ordered, or defrayed the cost of, the sacrifices, etc., as no doubt he did, the historian would properly and naturally describe him as offering burnt offerings. <span class="accented">Qui facit per alium facit per se</span>, and priests are expressly mentioned as present at these sacrifices (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-6.htm">1 Kings 8:6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-7.htm">2 Chronicles 5:7-14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-2.htm">2 Chronicles 7:2, 5</a>). We have just as much reason, and no more, for believing that the king built Mille (ver. 24) with his own hands, and with his own hands "made a navy of ships" (ver. 26), as that he sacrificed, etc., <span class="accented">in propria persona</span>. And, secondly, it is simply inconceivable, if he had so acted, that it should have attracted no more notice, and that our historian should have passed it over thus lightly. We know what is recorded by our author as having happened when, less than two centuries afterwards, King Uzziah presumed to intrude on the functions of the priests (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/13-1.htm">1 Kings 13:1</a>), and we know what had happened some five centuries before (<a href="../../par/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>), when men who were not of the seed of Aaron came near to offer incense before the Lord. It is impossible that Solomon could have disregarded that solemn warning without some protest, or without a syllable of blame on the part of our author. And the true account of these sacrifices is that they were offered by the king as the <span class="accented">builder of the temple</span>, and probably throughout his life, by the hands of the ministering priests (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-14.htm">2 Chronicles 8:14</a>). Thrice in the year he showed his piety by a great function, at which he offered liberally] <span class="cmt_word">upon the altar</span> [Heb. <span class="accented">upon that, sc</span>. altar <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span>. See Gesen. Lex., p. 94; Ewald, Syntax, 332a (3) ] <span class="cmt_word">that was before the Lord.</span> [The altar of incense stood before the entrance to the  oracle, the place of the Divine presence. See on 1 Kings 6:22-3. <span class="cmt_word">So he finished the house.</span> [Same word, but in the Kal form in <a href="../../par/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>. The Piel form, used here, may convey the deeper meaning, "he perfected," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by devoting it to its proper use. It was to be "a house of <span class="accented">sacrifice"</span> (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/7-12.htm">2 Chronicles 7:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a></div><div class="verse">And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which <i>is</i> beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And king Solomon made a navy of ships</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, a collective noun, <span class="accented">classis</span>. The chronicler paraphrases by <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, plural. This fact finds a record here, probably because it was to the voyages of this fleet that the king was indebted for the gold which enabled him to erect and adorn the buildings recently described. (As to form, etc., of the ships, see Dict. Bib. 2. p. 1014). But no historian could pass over without notice an event of such profound importance to Israel as the construction of its first ships, which, next to the temple, was the great event of Solomon's reign] <span class="cmt_word">in Ezion-geber</span> [lit., the <span class="accented">backbone of a man</span> (or <span class="accented">giant</span>). Cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/33-35.htm">Numbers 33:35</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/4-22.htm">2 Kings 4:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-17.htm">2 Chronicles 8:17</a>. The name is probably due, like Shechem (see note on 1 Kings 12:25) to a real or fancied resemblance in the physical geography of the country to that part of the human body. Stanley (S. and P. p. 84) speaks of "the jagged ranges on each side of the gulf." <span class="accented">Akaba</span>, the modern name, also means <span class="accented">back</span>. 2 Chronicles <span class="accented">l.c.</span> says Solomon went to Ezion-geber, which it is highly probable he would do], <span class="cmt_word">which is beside</span> [Heb. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>   =  aloud (Gesen., Lex. <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)] <span class="cmt_word">Eloth</span> [lit., <span class="accented">trees</span> akin to Elim, where were <span class="accented">palm</span> trees (<a href="../../par/exodus/15-27.htm">Exodus 15:27</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/16-1.htm">Exodus 16:1</a>). The name is interesting as suggesting that Solomon may have found some of the timber for the construction of his fleet here. A grove of palm trees "still exists at the head of the gulf of Akaba" (Stanley S. and P. p. 20). Palms, it is true, are not adapted to shipbuilding, but other timber may have grown there in a past age. But see note on ver. 27. For Elath, see Porter, p. 40; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> (which shows how it passed into the hand of Israel); <a href="../../par/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/16-6.htm">2 Kings 16:6</a>.

"Fragments of red coral are forever being thrown up from the stores below, and it is these coral-line forests which form the true 'weeds' of this fantastic sea" (Stanley, S. and P. p. 83). There is also apparently a bottom of red sandstone (<span class="accented">ib</span>. p. 6, note). It is divided by the Sinaitic peninsula into two arms or gulfs, the western being the Gulf of Suez, and the eastern the Gulf of Akabah. The former is 130 miles, the latter 90 miles long], <span class="cmt_word">in the land of Edom</span>. [The subjugation of Edom is mentioned <a href="../../par/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>.] 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_kings/9-27.htm">1 Kings 9:27</a></div><div class="verse">And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of Solomon.</span> [The chronicler states (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/8-18.htm">2 Chronicles 8:18</a>) that he sent ships as well as servants, and it has been thought that ships were transported, in parts or entire, by land across the Isthmus of Suez, and there are certainly instances on record of the land transport of fleets. (Keil reminds us that Alexander the Great, according to Arrian, had snips transported - in pieces - from Phoenicia to the Euphrates, and that, according to Thucydides (Bell. Pelop. 4:8) the Peloponnesians conveyed 60 ships from Corcyra across the Leucadian Isthmus, etc.) But this, especially when the state of engineering science, etc., among the Hebrews is taken into account, is hardly to be thought cf. It is quite possible, however, that <span class="accented">timber</span> for shipbuilding was floated on the Mediterranean down to the river of Egypt, or some such place, and then transported either to Suez or to Akaba. Probably all that the chronicler means is that Hiram provided the materials and had the ships built. The Israelites, having hitherto had no fleet, and little or no experience of the sea, were unable to construct ships for themselves. And the Tyrians may have seen in the construction of a fleet for <span class="accented">eastern</span> voyages, an opening for the extension of their own maritime trade. Possibly in the first voyages Tyriaus and Jews were copartners.]

The opinions of scholars may, however, be practically reduced to two, The first would place Ophir in India; the second in southern Arabia. In favour of India is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the three years' voyage (but see on 1 Kings 10:22); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> most of the other treasures brought back by the fleet, exclusive of gold, are Indian products. But against it is urged the important fact that no gold is now found there, south of Cashmere, whilst south Arabia was famed for its abundant gold (<a href="../../par/psalms/72-15.htm">Psalm 72:15</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/27-22.htm">Ezekiel 27:22</a>). On the other hand, it is alleged that in ancient times India was rich in gold (Ewald, 3. p. 264), and that there are no traces of gold mines in Arabia. The question is discussed at considerable length and with great learning by Mr. Twisleton (Dict. Bib. art. "Ophir"). He shows that it is reasonably certain <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the Ophir of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-29.htm">Genesis 10:29</a> is the name of some city, region, or tribe in <span class="accented">Arabia</span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the Ophir of Genesis is the Ophir of the Book of Kings. And Gesenius, Bahr, Keil, <span class="accented">al</span>.  agree with him in locating Ophir in the latter country. Ewald, however, sees in Ophir "the most distant coasts of India," and it is probable that the Hebrews used the word somewhat loosely, as they did the corresponding word <span class="accented">Tarshish</span>, and as we do the words East and West Indies. They were not geographers, and Ophir may have been merely an emporium where the products of different countries were collected, or a <span class="accented">nomen generale</span> for "all the countries lying on the African, Arabian, or Indian seas, so far as at that time known" (Heeren).
