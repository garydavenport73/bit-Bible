The lightning flash which had struck them down had not injured their clothes. As Mishael and Elzaphan became ceremonially defiled by contact with the corpses, and as the Passover was now at hand, it has been thought that it was in reference to their case that the concession was made, that those d, filed by a dead body might keep the Passover on the fourteenth day of the second instead of the first month (<a href="../../par/numbers/9-6.htm">Numbers 9:6-11</a>).

Cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/8-21.htm">Matthew 8:21, 22</a>, "Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. But Jesus said unto him, Follow me."

The law given to Aaron (some manuscripts read Moses) against the use of wine by the priests during their ministrations, by its juxtaposition with what has gone before, has led to the probable supposition that Nadab and Abihu had acted under the excitement of intoxicating drink. It is possible that the sacrificial meals on the peace offerings had begun, and that at the same time that the congregation was feasting, the two priests had refreshed themselves with wine after their long service. The special ceremonial meal of the priests had not yet been eaten.
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: <i>it shall be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations:</div><div class="comm">

Nadab and Abihu, on the contrary, had not distinguished between the sacred and profane fire, or between God's commands and their own unregulated impulses. If they had partaken too freely of the wine provided for the drink offerings, their sin would be similar to that of the Corinthians in their abuse of the Lord's Supper. As to the use of wine by the minister of God under the New Testament, see <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a>. The spiritual emotion, which, in the service of God, shows itself in pouring out the feelings in "psalms and hymns and spiritual songs," is contrasted, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18, 19</a>, with the physical excitement caused by wine, the former being commended and the latter forbidden.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it <i>is</i> most holy:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-20.</span> - Moses takes care that the remaining part of the ritual of the day shall be carried out in spite of the terrible interruption that has occurred. Under his instructions, Aaron and Eleazar and Ithamar eat the remainder of <span class="cmt_word">the meat offering</span> (<a href="../../par/leviticus/9-17.htm">Leviticus 9:17</a>), in the court of the tabernacle, and reserve <span class="cmt_word">the wave breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">heave shoulder</span> to <span class="cmt_word">eat in a clean place</span>, that is, not necessarily within the court; but he finds that the sin offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a>), which ought to be eaten by the priests, had been burnt. The rule was that, when the blood was presented in the tabernacle, the flesh was burned; when it was not, the flesh was eaten by the priests. In the present case, the blood had not been brought within the holy place, and yet the flesh had been burned instead of being eaten. Moses was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, and demanded an explanation. Aaron's plea of defense was twofold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> His sons had fulfilled aright the ritual of their own sin offering and burnt offering, that is, the offerings made for the priests, and it had been rather his duty than theirs to see that the ritual of the sin offering of the congregation had been properly carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The state of distress in which he was, and the near escape that he had had from ceremonial defilement, and the sense of sin brought home to him by his children's death, had made him unfit and unable to eat the sin offering of the people, as he should have done under other circumstances. With this plea Moses was content. It was true that the letter of the Law had been broken, but there was a sufficient cause for it (see <a href="../../par/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>). It appears from hence that the expiation wrought by the sin offering was not complete until the whole ceremony was accomplished, the last act of which was the eating of the flesh by the priests in one class of sin offering, and the burning the flesh outside the camp in the other. It has been questioned, what is the full meaning of the expression, God hath given it you - the flesh of the sin offering - to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the Lord. Archdeacon Freeman expresses the view of A Lapide, Keil, and many others when he says that, by eating the flesh of the offering, the priests "in a deep mystery neutralized, through the holiness vested in them by their consecration, the sin which the offerer had laid upon the victim and upon them" ('Principles of Divine Service,' part 2). Oehler, on the other hand (Herzog's 'Cyclop.,' 10), maintains that the priests did no more by this act than <span class="accented">declare</span> the removal of the sin already taken away; with which accords Philo's explanation ('De Vict.,' 13, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 6.) that the object of the sacrificial meal was to carry assurance of acceptance to the offerer, "since God would never have allowed his servants to partake of it had there not been a complete removal and forgetting of the sin atoned for." Neither of these explanations seems to be altogether satisfactory. The former attributes more meaning to the expression <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> than it appears to have elsewhere; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/exodus/28-38.htm">Exodus 28:38</a> and <a href="../../par/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, where Aaron is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity of the holy things</span> and <span class="accented">of the sanctuary</span>; and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>, where the prophet is said to <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> of Israel and Judah. The latter interpretation appears too much to evacuate the meaning of the words. It is quite certain that the part of the ceremony by which the atonement was wrought (if it was wrought by any one part) was the offering of the blood for the covering of the offerer's sins, but yet this action of the priests in eating the flesh of the victim was in some way also connected with the atonement, not only with the assurance of its having been wrought; but in what way this was effected we are not told, and cannot pronounce. The words <span class="accented">bear the iniquity</span> are equivalent to making atonement for by taking the sin in some sense upon themselves (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-11.htm">Isaiah 53:11</a>, "He shall bear their iniquities," and <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, "Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away [or beareth] the sin of the world'). Accordingly, Bishop Patrick comments: "The very eating of the people's sin offering argued the sins of the people were, <span class="accented">in some sort</span>, laid upon the priests, to be taken away by them. From whence the sacrifice of Christ may be explained, who is said to <span class="accented">bear our iniquity</span> (as the priest is here said to do), all our sins being laid on him, who took upon him to make an expiation for them by the sacrifice of himself. For the priest, hereby eating of the sin offering, receiving the guilt upon himself, may well be thought to prefigure One who should be both Priest and Sacrifice for sin; which was accomplished in Christ" (on <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-17.htm">Leviticus 10:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The reasons of this are plain: for <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the flesh still retains the blood, which no Israelite might eat; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> there is something loathsome in the idea of eating such flesh. Next, as to beasts, a class is marked off as edible by two plainly discernible characteristics, and instances are given to show that where there is any doubt owing to the animals possessing one of the characteristic marks only, the rule is to be construed strictly. As to fish and insects, equally plain rules, one in each case, are laid down; but as birds are not readily distinguished into large classes, the names of those that are unclean are given one by one, the remainder being all of them permissible. Thus the simple Israelite would run no risk of incurring uncleanness by inadvertently eating unclean food, whether of beast, bird, fish, or insect. The object of the regulations being to exclude all meats naturally offensive to the human taste, all carnivorous quadrupeds are shut out by the rule of chewing the cud (verse 3), with the same purpose, birds of prey and birds that eat offal are prohibited (verses 13-19), and scaleless fish on account of their repulsive appearance (verses 9-12), as well as beetles, maggots, and vermin of all sorts. In the case of beasts and fish, the rules laid down to mark off those things that are offensive, being general in their application, are such as to include in the forbidden class some few which do not appear naturally loathsome. This is owing partly to the difficulty of classification, partly to a change of feeling which experience has wrought in the sentiments of mankind with regard to such edibles as swine's flesh and shell-fish.

"They live in the natural caves and clefts of the rocks (<a href="../../par/psalms/104-18.htm">Psalm 104:18</a>), are very gregarious, being often seen seated in troops before the openings of their caves, and extremely timid, as they are quite defenseless (<a href="../../par/proverbs/30-26.htm">Proverbs 30:26</a>). They are about the size of rabbits, of a brownish-gray or brownish-yellow color, but white under the belly; they have bright eyes, round ears, and no tail. The Arabs eat them, but do not place them before their guests" (Keil). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-6.htm">Leviticus 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he <i>is</i> unclean unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof</span>, There is little doubt that the same animal as our hare is meant. Neither the hare, however, nor the hyrax chews the cud in the strict sense of the words. But they have the appearance of doing so. The rule respecting chewing the cud was given to and by Moses as a legislator, not as an anatomist, to serve as a sign by which animals might be known to be clean for food. Phenomenal not scientific language is used here, as in <a href="../../par/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>, "as we might speak of whales and their congeners as fish, when there is no need of scientific accuracy" (Clark). "All these marks of distinction in the Levitical law are wisely and even necessarily made on the basis of popular observation and belief, not on that of anatomical exactness. Otherwise the people would have been continually liable to error. Scientifically, the camel would be said to divide the hoof, and the hare does not chew the cud. But laws for popular use must necessarily employ terms as they are popularly understood. These matters are often referred to as scientific errors; whereas they were simply descriptions, necessarily popular, for the understanding and enforcement of the law" (Gardiner). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he <i>is</i> unclean to you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted.</span> Here, again, the description is not according to anatomical analysis, but to ordinary appearance. The pig appears to be cloven-footed, and it would be misleading to give any other account of his foot in ordinary speech, but scientifically speaking, he has four toes. The prohibition of the use of swine's flesh does not arise from the fear of trichinosis or other disease, but from the disgust caused by the carnivorous and filthy habits of the Eastern pig. The repulsion originally felt for swine's flesh was natural, and, where the animal is carnivorous, is still natural, but where its habits are changed, and it has become simply graminivorous, the feeling has ceased to exist.

Eels and shell-fish are thus forbidden, though a long course of experience has now taken away the feeling of repulsion with which they were once looked upon. The flesh of the beasts for, bidden to be eaten is only described as unclean, but that of the prohibited fish, birds, insects, and vermin, is designated as <span class="cmt_word">an abomination unto you</span>.

None are allowed except the <span class="accented">Saltatoria</span>, or locust family. The word translated beetle signifies a sort of locust, like the other three words. That the locust was a regular article of food in Palestine is amply proved. "It is well known that locusts were eaten by many of the nations of antiquity, both in Asia and Africa, and even the ancient Greek thought the <span class="accented">cicadas</span> very agreeable in flavour (Arist. 'Hist. An.,' 5:30). In Arabia they are sold in the market, sometimes strung upon cords, sometimes by measure, and they are also dried and kept in bags for winter use....

They are also boiled in salt and water, and eaten with salt or butter. Another process is to dry them thoroughly, and then grind them into meal, and make cakes of them" (Keil). (Cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>.)

In accordance with these instincts, purifying rites are commanded for the restoration of those affected to ceremonial cleanness. These instincts and consequent regulations respecting women in childbirth are found in very many different nations. "The Hindoo law pronounced the mother of a newborn child to be impure for forty days, required the father to bathe as soon as the birth had taken place, and debarred the whole family for a period from religious rites, while they were 'to confine themselves to an inward remembrance of the Deity;' in a Brahmin family this rule extended to all relations within the fourth degree, for ten days, at the end of which they had to bathe. According to the Parsee law, the mother and child were bathed, and the mother had to live in seclusion for forty days, after which she had to undergo other purifying rites. The Arabs are said by Burekhardt to regard the mother as unclean for forty days. The ancient Greeks suffered neither childbirth nor death to take place within consecrated places; both mother and child were bathed, and the mother was not allowed to approach an altar for forty days. The term of forty days, it is evident, was generally regarded as a critical one for both the mother and the child. The day on which the Romans gave the name to the child - the eighth day for a girl, and the ninth for a boy - was called <span class="accented">lustrieus dies</span>, 'the day of purification,' because certain lustral rites in behalf of the child were performed on the occasion, and some sort of offering was made. The <span class="accented">amphidromia</span> of the Greeks was a similar lustration for the child, when the name was given, probably between the seventh and tenth days" (Clark).

See <a href="../../par/luke/2-20.htm">Luke 2:20</a>, where the right reading is, "When the days of <span class="accented">their</span> purification, according to the Law of Moses, were accomplished." For eight days the infant Saviour submitted to legal uncleanness in "fulfilling all righteousness" (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>), and therefore the whole forty days were spoken of as "the days of their purification."

No doubt the changed order is owing to the cause just mentioned; the idea of sin, though it may not be altogether put aside (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>), is not to be prominent, as though it were peculiar to the special woman who was purified.

A third cause of uncleanness is found in a third class of offensive or repulsive objects. There is no disease which produces so foul an appearance in the human form as leprosy. There was, therefore, no disease so suitable for creating ceremonial, because representing spiritual, uncleanness. The name leprosy has been made to cover a number of diseases similar but not identical in character. There are many spurious forms of leprosy, and many diseases akin to leprosy which do not now come under discussion. The disease here dealt with is elephantiasis, especially in its anesthetic form, which is otherwise called white leprosy. The two varieties of elephantiasis - the tuberculated and the anesthetic - are, however, so closely connected together that they cannot be separated, the one. often running into the other. The first symptom of the malady is a painless spot, which covers an indolent ulcer. This ulcer may continue unprogressive for months or for years, during which the person affected is able to do his ordinary business; but at the end of these periods, whether longer or shorter, it produces a more repulsive and foul disfigurement of the human face and frame than any known disease, the features of the face changing their character, and part of the body occasionally mortifying and dropping off. Death at last comes suddenly, when a vital part of the body has been affected. The home of leprosy has in all ages been Syria and Egypt and the countries adjacent to them, but Europe has not escaped the scourge. In the Middle Ages, no European country was free from it; London had at one time six leper houses; cases were found not unfrequently in Scotland till the middle of the last century; and there was a death certified by medical science to have resulted from leprosy in the city of Norwich in the year 1880. The object of the regulations relating to leprosy is no more sanitary than of those relating to unclean meats. Like the latter, they may have served a sanitary purpose, for leprosy is, according to the prevailing medical opinion, slightly, though only slightly, contagious. Because leprosy was hideous and foul, it therefore made the man affected by it unclean, and before he could be restored to communion with God and his people, he must be certified by God's priest to be delivered from the disease. As in the previous cases, physical ugliness and defilement represent spiritual depravity and viciousness. "The Levitical law concerning leprosy reveals to us the true nature of sin. It shows its hideousness and its foulness, and fills us with shame, hatred, and loathing for it. And it reveals to us the inestimable benefit which we have received from the incarnation of the Son of God, 'the Sun of Righteousness, with healing in his wings' (<a href="../../par/malachi/4-2.htm">Malachi 4:2</a>); and fills us with joy, thankfulness, and love to him for his infinite goodness to us" (Wordsworth). Leprosy, the most loathsome of all common diseases, is the type and symbol of sin, and the ceremonial uncleanness attaching to it is a parable of the moral foulness of sin.

Of course, lepers would naturally associate with each other, and so we find that they actually did (<a href="../../par/luke/17-12.htm">Luke 17:12</a>). As their presence was supposed to defile any place that they entered, they were punished in later times with forty stripes if they did not observe the restraints laid down for them. "They were, however, admitted to the synagogue, where a place was railed off for them, ten handbreadths high and four cubits wide, on condition of their entering the house of worship before the rest of the congregation and leaving it after them" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The exclusion of the leper was not for the purpose of avoiding contagion, nor to serve as a penalty for having contracted so loathsome a disease, but primarily to prevent the spread of ceremonial uncleanness communicated by his touch, and typically and mystically to teach that the fate brought upon a man by unremoved sin is separation from the people of God here and hereafter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

In later times it was ordered that the examination was not to take place on the sabbath, nor in the early morning, nor in the late afternoon, nor inside a house, nor on a cloudy day, nor in the glare of midday, and that the priest must have good eyesight, and only determine one case at a time; nor was he allowed to pronounce judgment on his own kindred. <span class="cmt_word">And, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper.</span> The plague of leprosy is healed before the ceremony of purification begins, but the leper is not <span class="accented">pronounced clean</span> until he has been sprinkled with the blood and water (verse 7). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive <i>and</i> clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop.</span> "Cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet ' are also to be burnt with the red heifer for the ashes for the water of separation (<a href="../../par/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>), and they appear to have been commonly employed in purifications (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-19.htm">Hebrews 9:19</a>). The antiseptic properties of cedar made it peculiarly suitable for such occasions. The hyssop "was probably not the plant which we call hyssop, the <span class="accented">Hyssopus officinalis.</span> for it is uncertain whether this is to be found in Syria and Arabia, but a species of <span class="accented">origanum</span> resembling hyssop, the Arabian <span class="accented">zater</span>, either wild marjoram, or a kind of thyme" (Keil on REFERENCE_WORK:Keil & DelitzschExodus 12:21). The Psalmist's cry, "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be chart" (<a href="../../par/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>), shows the common use to which it was put. In the present case, the sweet smell both of the wood (one cubit's length of which was used) and of the herb would have still further adapted them for symbolizing the redemption of the leper's flesh from corruption and putrefaction. The <span class="accented">scarlet</span> was probably a band of scarlet wool with which the cedar and the hyssop were tied - not to the bird (for we have no account of their being after, wards removed), but (as in the burning of the red heifer) one to the other. The colour of the wool was appropriate, not only because it was about to be dipped in the blood and water, but also because it symbolized the purified and now healthy blood.

Now he pronounces him to be no leper, and therefore, after some further ceremonies, readmits him (verses 8, 20, 31). <span class="cmt_word">And shall let the living bird loose into the open field.</span> The symbolism of the two birds, which has been much misinterpreted, is essentially the same as that of the two goats on the day of atonement, though each ceremony has its distinctive features. The <span class="accented">killing</span> of the living bird was not a true sacrifice, as was the offering of the goat to Jehovah, but by its death it represented the state in which the leper had legally been, and to which he would have been physically reduced had not a remedy been found. The deathly and unclean state of the leper having been symbolically transferred from the dead bird to the living bird by the latter's being sprinkled in the former's blood, the living bird stands in the position of the scapegoat, on whom the sins of the people were laid. The bird is then <span class="accented">let loose into the open field</span>; literally, <span class="accented">upon the face of the field</span>; and it flies off, carrying with it the leper's uncleanness, and assuring him by every forward movement that it makes that the living death has passed from him, just as each step or' the scapegoat appeared to the Israelites to remove their sins from them. A large number of commentators, on the other hand, consider the released bird to symbolize the health and freedom now given back to the leper, and they dwell on the rapid and uncontrolled movement of birds as being peculiarly suitable for representing this recovered liberty. But this interpretation, to which there are many objections, appears to be altogether incompatible with the fact that the same ceremony is used in the cleansing of the leprous house, whereas the house could certainly not be represented as "recovered to unrestrained liberty" (Lunge). The common patristic view, that the two birds represent the two natures of the one Great Sacrifice offered to redeem man from sin, seems to be out of place here.

It is certainly singular that the peace offering should be omitted, and that the trespass offering should be required. The former fact may be accounted for by the supposition that though the peace offering was not required, the late leper was, after his other sacrifices, put in a position where he might offer it when he would of his own free will. But the requirement of the trespass offering is more difficult to explain. What wrong had the leper done? and what satisfaction had he to make? The usual answer to this question is that he had wronged Jehovah in that, however involuntarily, he had failed to bring him the offerings and service which he would have brought had he not been excluded from the camp. But this is a very forced explanation, and it is incompatible with other parts of the Law. For the leper was not the only unclean person who, owing to his uncleanness, was prevented from offering his gifts and worship at the tabernacle or temple. The woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years (<a href="../../par/luke/8-43.htm">Luke 8:43</a>) during that time would have been excluded from the sanctuary. But no trespass offering is required of those that have been unclean through issues. We must therefore, look for some other explanation of the requirement in the case of the cleansed leper. And a simpler one is at hand. Leprosy was the type of sin - or all sin whatsoever. When, therefore, the expiatory sacrifices were demanded, both kinds - the trespass offering and the sin offering - had to be offered, because expiation had to be made for the uncleanness which represented all unrighteousness - trespasses as well as sins. It might be that the man had not committed a trespass; he might also not hive committed sin; but he had been stricken with the foul disease which symbolized both one and the other, and therefore he had to offer on his cleansing the sacrifice appropriate to each. There is a difference in the ritual of the trespass offering in the present ease, intended perhaps to distinguish it from those trespass offerings which were made when a man had in his mind a certain wrong or injury which he had committed, and for which he wished to make compensation. On this occasion <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the animal presented was not required to be of a particular value, as in the ordinary trespass offerings; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it was waved, whereas the ordinary trespass offerings were not waved; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> it was waved by the priest, whereas other wave offerings were waved not by the priest, but by the offerer, whose bands were guided by the priests. Nor <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> did the offering of oil accompany the presentation of other trespass offerings. For whatever reason it be, the most characteristic feature of the sacrificial cleansing of the leper is the trespass offering, and the way that it was dealt with.

Two priests catch up the blood one in a vessel, the other in his band. He who catches it up in the vessel goes and throws it on the side of the altar, and he who catches it in his hand goes and stands before the leper. And the leper who had previously bathed in the court of the lepers, goes and stands in the gate of Nicanor. Rabbi Jehudah says he needs not bathe. He thrusts in his head (viz. into the great court, which he may not yet enter), and the priest puts of the blood upon the tip of his ear; he thrusts in his hand, and he puts it upon the thumb of his hand; he thrusts in his foot, and he puts it upon the great toe of his foot" ('Negaim,' 14:7, quoted by Edersheim, 'Temple Service,' chapter 18.). No doubt, the ear, the thumb, and the great toe are selected for the purpose of showing, as in the case of the consecration of the priest, that the senses and the active powers of the restored Israelite must be dedicated hence, forth to God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-15.htm">Leviticus 14:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the priest shall take <i>some</i> of the log of oil, and pour <i>it</i> into the palm of his own left hand:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.</span> This ceremony is altogether peculiar to this purification.

The Mishua (as before cited) continues the description of the ceremony as follows: - "The priest now takes from the log of oil and pours it into the palm of his colleague, though if he poured it into his own it were valid. He dips his finger and sprinkles seven times towards the holy of holies, dipping each time he sprinkles. He goes before the leper, and on the spot where he had put the blood he puts the oil, as it is written, 'Upon the blood of the trespass offering.' And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand, he pours on the head of him that is cleansed, for an atonement; if he so puts it, he is atoned for, but if not, he is not atoned for. So Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Jochanan, the son of Nuri, saith, This is only the remnant of the ordinance, whether it be done or not, the atonement is made; but they impute it to him (the priest), as if he had not made atonement." The double sprinkling with blood and oil betokened dedication as in the case of the priests, the blood specially denoting reconciliation, and the oil the strengthening power of God by which the new life was to be led.

The subject of leprosy in houses must be regarded from the same point of view as that of leprosy in clothes. The regulations respecting it are not sanitary laws, as Lange represents them, but rest, as Keil argues, upon an ideal or symbolical basis. The same thought is attached to all species of uncleanness. Something - it matters not what - produces a foul and repulsive appearance in the walls of a house. That is in itself sufficient to make that house unclean; for whatever is foul and repulsive is representative of moral and spiritual defilement, and therefore is itself symbolically defiling and defiled. It has been suggested that the special cause of the affection of the houses in Canaan was saltpetre exuding from the materials employed in their building, or iron pyrites in the stone used. This may have been so, or more probably it was the growth of some fungus. Whatever it was, the appearance created by it was so similar to that of leprosy in the human body, as to derive its name from the latter by analogy.
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/14-34.htm">Leviticus 14:34</a></div><div class="verse">When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession.</span> This is the first instance of a law being given which has no bearing on the present condition of the Israelites. but is to regulate their conduct when they had come into the promised land. From the time of Abraham downwards, the assurance of their entrance into that land had been possessed by the people of Israel (<a href="../../par/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>), and the expectation of the speedy fulfillment of that promise had been quickened by their exodus from Egypt, and the preparations made to march through the wilderness. There would, therefore, be nothing surprising to them in receiving instructions to guide their conduct when the entrance should have been effected. As the question is one of leprosy, it is natural that it should be treated of with the leprosy of the human subject and the leprosy of garments; but as it is not of immediate application, it is placed at the end, and dealt with after the rest of the subject has been discussed, being appended to the law of cleansing the leper, instead of preceding it. <span class="cmt_word">And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession.</span> This expression has led to the idea that the leprosy of houses was a special infliction at God's hand in a manner different flora other inflictions or diseases; but the words do not mean that. All that is done is in a sense done by God, inasmuch as his providence rules over all; and, therefore, by whatever secondary cause a thing may be brought about, it is he that does it. It is God that feeds the birds (<a href="../../par/luke/12-24.htm">Luke 12:24</a>), God that clothes the grass (<a href="../../par/luke/12-28.htm">Luke 12:28</a>), nor does one sparrow fall to the ground without him (<a href="../../par/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>). It is he, therefore, that <span class="accented">puts the plague in a house</span>, as the Lord of all things (cf. <a href="../../par/isaiah/45-6.htm">Isaiah 45:6, 7</a>, "I am the Lord, and there is none else. I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things"). The expression militates, though not strongly, against the notion that the house caught the leprosy from the leper that lived in it.

First, the house is to be emptied of its furniture, lest the latter should contract a ceremonial uncleanness in case the house were found to be leprous, but not, it will be noted, lest it should convey contagion or infection.

THE CEREMONIAL PURIFICATION OF THE WHOLE CONGREGATION ON THE GREAT DAY OF ATONEMENT. This chapter, containing the account of the institution of the ceremonial to be used on the Day of Atonement, would take its place chronologically immediately after the tenth chapter, for the instructions conveyed in it were delivered to Moses <span class="accented">"after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the Lord and died"</span> (verse 1), when the fate of Nadab and Abihu would naturally have led Aaron to desire a more perfect knowledge than had as yet been imparted to him as to the manner in which he was to present himself before the Lord. Logically it might either occupy its present position, as being the great and culminating atoning and cleansing ceremony, or it might be relegated to a place among the holy days in chapter 23, where it is, in fact, shortly noticed. That it is placed here shows that the most essential characteristic of the Day in the judgment of the legislator is that of its serving as the occasion and the means of "making <span class="accented">an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and making an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and for making an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation"</span> (verse 33). Annually there gathered over the camp, and over the sanctuary as situated in the midst of the camp, a mass of defilement, arising in part from sins whose guilt had not been removed by the punishment of the offenders, and in part from uncleannesses which had not been cleansed by sacrifices and the prescribed ceremonial rites. Annually this defilement had to be atoned for or covered away from the sight of God. This was done by the solemn observance of the great Day of Atonement, and specially by the high priest's carrying the blood of the sacrifices into the holy of holies, into which he might enter on no other day of the year; while the consciousness of deliverance from the guilt of sin was quickened on the part of the people by their seeing the scapegoat <span class="accented">"bear</span> <span class="accented">away upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited"</span> (verse 22). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy <i>place</i> within the vail before the mercy seat, which <i>is</i> upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy</span> place <span class="cmt_word">within the vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark;</span> that he die not. Nadab and Abihu having died for their rash presumption in venturing unbidden into the tabernacle, it was natural that Aaron, who had as yet but once penetrated into the holy of holies, should be struck with fear, and that he should desire Divine instruction as to the times and manner in which he was to appear before the Lord, lest he should be struck dead like his sons. If the attempt to enter the outer chamber of the tabernacle had been so fatal to them, what might not be the result to him of entering <span class="accented">within the vail</span> which hung <span class="accented">before the mercy-seat which is upon the ark?</span> The mercy-seat  <span class="accented">- capporeth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">propitiatorium -</span> formed the top of the ark, and was the place where God specially exhibited his Presence, on the occasions of his manifestation, by the bright <span class="accented">cloud</span> which then rested upon it between the cherubim. It was this Presence which made it perilous for Aaron to appear within the vail unbidden or without the becoming ritual; for man might not meet God unless he were sanctified for the purpose (<a href="../../par/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14, 21-24</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). The words, for <span class="cmt_word">I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat,</span> refer to the Divine Presence thus visibly manifested (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-12</a>), and not, as they have strangely been misinterpreted, to the cloud of smoke raised by the incense burnt by the high priest on his entrance. They do not, however, prove that the manifestation was constantly there, still less that it was continued, according to Jewish tradition, in later times. "The reason for the prohibition of Aaron's entrance at his own pleasure, or without the expiatory blood of sacrifice, is to be found in the fact that the holiness communicated to the priest did not cancel the sin of his nature, but only covered it over for the performance of his official duties; and so long as the Law, which produced only the knowledge of sin, and not its forgiveness and removal, was not abolished by the complete atonement, the holy God was and remained to mortal and sinful man a consuming fire, before which no one could stand" (Keil).

"Thus" would be translated more literally by <span class="accented">With this.</span> He must come supplied with the specified offerings, dressed in the appointed manner and using the ceremonial here designated. The efficacy of the acts of the high priest on this day and throughout his ministrations depended not upon his individual but on his official character, and on his obedience to the various commandments positively enjoined. Personal worthiness would not qualify him for his service, nor personal unworthiness hinder the effect of his liturgical acts (cf. Art. 26, 'Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacrament'). Aaron's special offerings for himself on this great day are to be a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

The reading should therefore be, <span class="accented">He shall put on a holy linen coat, and he shall have linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with a linen mitre shall be attired.</span> The clothing was white from head to foot, differing therein from the dress of the ordinary priest, inasmuch as the sash or girdle of the latter was of variegated materials, and differing also in the shape of the mitre. The white clothing was not intended to symbolize humility and penitence, as some have thought, for white is not the colour in which penitents are naturally dressed. Rather it was symbolical of the purity and holiness which the ceremonies of the day symbolically affected, and which was specially needed to be exhibited in the person of the high priest. In the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel, the angel of God is clothed in <span class="accented">linen</span> (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2, 3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-2.htm">Ezekiel 10:2, 6, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6, 7</a>). And the colour of the angelic raiment is described in the Gospels as <span class="accented">white:</span> "his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow" (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a>); "they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment" (<a href="../../par/mark/16-5.htm">Mark 16:5</a>); "two men stood by them in shining garments" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>); she "seeth two angels in white sitting" (<a href="../../par/john/20-12.htm">John 20:12</a>). So, too, the wife of the Lamb, in the Book of the Revelation, has it "granted to her that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints" (<a href="../../par/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7, 8</a>). The white linen dress of the high priest, therefore (which must have given the appearance of the English surplice tied in at the waist), was intended to symbolize the purity and brightness which forms the characteristic of angels and saints, and, above all, of the King of saints. "The white material of the dress which Aaron wore when performing the highest act of expiation under the Old Testament was a symbolical shadowing forth of the holiness and glory of the one perfect Mediator between God and man, who, being the radiation of the glory of God and the image of his nature, effected by himself the perfect cleansing away of our sin, and who, as the true High Priest, being holy, innocent, unspotted, and separate from sinners, entered once by his own blood into the holy place not made with hands, namely, into heaven itself, to appear before the face of God for us and obtain everlasting redemption (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-12.htm">Hebrews 9:12, 24</a>)" (Keil). The symbolism of the <span class="accented">holy garments</span> as indicating holiness and purity, is strengthened by the command that Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</span> The high priest's acts on this day, so far as they are recounted in this chapter, were the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He bathed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He dressed himself in his white holy garments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He offered or presented at the door of the tabernacle a bullock for a sin offering for himself and his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He presented at the same place two goats for a sin offering for the congregation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He cast lots on the two goats, one of which was to be sacrificed, the other to he let go into the wilderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He sacrificed the bullock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He passed from the court through the holy place into the holy of holies with a censer and incense, and filled the space beyond the vail with a cloud of smoke from the incense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">8.</span> He returned to the court, and, taking some of the blood of the bullock, passed again within the vail, and there sprinkled the blood once on the front of the mercy-seat and seven times before it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">9.</span> He came out again into the court, and killed the goat on which the lot for sacrifice had fallen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">10.</span> For the third time he entered the holy of holies, and went through the same process with the goat's blood as with the bullock's blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">11.</span> He purified the other part of the tabernacle, as he had purified the holy of holies, by sprinkling with the atoning blood, as before, and placing some of it on the horns of the altar of incense (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">12.</span> He returned to the court, and placed the blood of the bullock and goat upon the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice, and sprinkled it seven times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">13.</span> He offered to God the remaining goat, laying his hands upon it, confessing and laying the sins of the people upon its head. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">14.</span> He consigned the goat to a man, whose business it was to conduct it to the border of the wilderness, and there release it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">15.</span> He bathed and changed his linen vestments for his commonly worn high priest's dress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">16.</span> He sacrificed, one after the other, the two rams as burnt offerings for himself and for the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">17.</span> He burnt the fat of the sin offerings upon the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">18.</span> He took measures that the remainder of the sin offerings should be burnt without the camp. In <a href="../../par/numbers/29-7.htm">Numbers 29:7-11</a>, twelve sacrifices are commanded to be offered by the high priest on this day, namely, the morning and evening sacrifice; a burnt offering for the people, consisting of one young bullock, one ram (as already stated), and seven lambs; and cue goat for a sin offering; so that in all there were fifteen sacrifices offered, besides the meat and drink offerings. The punctiliousness of the Jews in later times was not content that the ceremonies should begin on the day itself. Preparations commenced a full week previously. On the third day of the seventh month, the high priest moved from his house in the city into the temple, and he was twice sprinkled with the ashes of the red heifer, by way of precaution against defilement. He spent the week in practicing and rehearsing, under the eye of some of the elders of the Sanhedrim, the various acts that he would have to perform on the great day, and on the night immediately preceding it he was not allowed to sleep. In case of his sudden death or disqualification, a substitute was appointed to fulfill his function. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-5.htm">Leviticus 16:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats.</span> It was necessary that the sacrifice offered for a person or class of persons should be provided by the offerer or offerers. The <span class="accented">two kids of the goats</span>, or rather the <span class="accented">two he-goats</span>, constituted together but one sin offering. This is important for the understanding of the sequel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-6.htm">Leviticus 16:6</a></div><div class="verse">And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which <i>is</i> for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Aaron shall offer his bullock...  and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</span> The first step is an expiatory offering to reconcile the officiating priest and the remainder of the priestly house to God. This was necessary before his offerings for the people could be accepted. It indicates the defects inherent in a priest whose nature was only that of man, which is compassed about with infirmities. The <span class="accented">offering</span> here commanded is not the slaying, but the solemn presentation, of the bullock to the Lord. In after times the following form of confession was used by the high priest when he laid his hand upon the bullock: - "O Lord, I have committed iniquity; I have transgressed; I have sinned, I and my house. O Lord, I entreat thee, cover over the iniquities, the transgressions, and the sins which I have committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee, I and my house; even as it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, 'For on that day will he cover over for you, to make you clean; from all your transgressions before the Lord ye shall be cleansed" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-7.htm">Leviticus 16:7</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD <i>at</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It must be carefully noted that. as the two goats made one sin offering (verse 5), so they are both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> By this solemn presentation they became the Lord's, one as much as the other. After this, Aaron is to <span class="cmt_word">cast lots upon the two goats.</span> The two goats, of the same size and appearance as far as possible, stood together near the entrance of the court. And by them was an urn containing two lots. These the high priest drew out at the same moment, placing one on the head of one goat, the other on the head of the other goat. According as the lot fell. one of the goats was taken and at once offered to the Lord, with a view to being shortly sacrificed; the other was appointed for a scapegoat, and reserved till the expiatory sacrifices had been made, when it too was offered to the Lord, and then sent away into the wilderness. After the lot had been chosen, the two goats were distinguished from each other by having a piece of scarlet cloth tied, the first round its neck, the second round its horn. <span class="cmt_word">One lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</span> The last word is in the original <span class="accented">la-azazel</span>, and being found only in this chapter, it has caused a great discrepancy of opinion among interpreters as to its meaning. It has been diversely regarded as a place, a person, a thing, and an abstraction. The first class of interpreters explain it as some district of the wilderness; the second understand by it an evil spirit; the third take it as a designation of the goat; the fourth translate it, "for removal." The first interpretation may be summarily rejected. If a localized spot were meant, that spot would have been left behind by a people constantly on the move. The second hypothesis - that <span class="accented">azazel</span> was an evil spirit, or the evil spirit - has been embraced by so considerable a number of modern expositors, that it is necessary to dwell upon it at some length. But, indeed, it has little to recommend it. It has been argued that <span class="accented">azazel</span> must be a proper name, because it has no article prefixed to it, <span class="accented">la-azazel.</span> This is a grammatical error. When a noun expresses an office or a function, and has the preposition <span class="accented">le</span> or <span class="accented">la</span> prefixed to it, it does not take an article in Hebrew any more than in French; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, in the verse, "Jehu...  shalt thou anoint to be king (or for king) over Israel; and Elisha...  shalt thou appoint to be prophet (or for prophet) in thy room" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), the Hebrew is <span class="accented">le-melek</span> and <span class="accented">le-navi</span>, without the article. The same idiom will be found in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>. With greater plausibility it is argued that verse 8 contrasts Jehovah and Azazel, and that if <span class="accented">la-Yehovah</span> be translated "for Jehovah," or "for the Lord," <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> must be translated "for Azazel." It may be allowed that there is a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> likelihood that, where words are thus contrasted, if one designates a person, the other would designate a person. But it is an incredibly rash assertion that this is always the case. All depends upon the idea which the speaker or writer has in his mind and desires to express. As part of the same argument, it is urged that the preposition, being the same in both clauses of the sentence, must be translated by the same word. This is certainly not the case. The natural meaning of <span class="accented">le</span> with a proper name is "for," and with a word expressing the performance of some function (technically called <span class="accented">nomen agentis</span>) it means "to be" (see the passage quoted above from <a href="../../par/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>). Unless, therefore, <span class="accented">azazel</span> be a proper name (which has to be proved, not assumed)the preposition need not and ought not to be translated by "for" but by "to be." The word <span class="accented">le</span> is used with great latitude, and often in a different sense in the same sentence; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="../../par/exodus/12-24.htm">Exodus 12:24</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a>. The objections to the theory that <span class="accented">azazel</span> means an evil spirit are of overwhelming force. It will be enough to name the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The name <span class="accented">azazel</span> is nowhere else mentioned. This could not be, if he were so important a being as to divide with Jehovah the sin offering of the congregation of Israel on the great Day of Atonement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> No suitable etymology can be discerned. The nearest approach to it is very forced - "the separated one." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The notion of appeasing, or bribing, or mocking the evil spirit by presenting to him a goat, is altogether alien from the spirit of the rest of the Mosaic institutions. Where else is there anything like it? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> The goat is presented and offered to Jehovah equally with the goat which is slain. To take that which has been offered (and therefore half sacrificed) to God and give it to Satan, would be a daring impiety, which is inconceivable. That <span class="accented">la-azazel</span> means "for removal" is the opinion of Bahr, Tholuck, Winer, and others. There is nothing objectionable in this interpretation, but the form of the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> points rather to an agent than to an abstract act. <span class="accented">Azazel</span> is a word softened (according to a not unusual custom) from <span class="accented">azalzel</span>, just as <span class="accented">kokav</span> is a softened form of <span class="accented">kay-kay</span>, and as Babel is derived from Balbel (<a href="../../par/genesis/11-9.htm">Genesis 11:9</a>). <span class="accented">Azalzel is</span> an active participle or participial noun, derived ultimately from <span class="accented">azal</span> (connected with the Arabic word <span class="accented">azala</span>, and meaning removed), but immediately from the reduplicate form of that verb, <span class="accented">azazal.</span> The reduplication of the consonants of the root in Hebrew and Arabic gives the force of repetition, so that while <span class="accented">azal</span> means removed, <span class="accented">azalzal</span> means removed by a repetition of acts. <span class="accented">Azalzel</span>, or <span class="accented">azazel</span>, therefore, means one who removes by a series of acts. <span class="accented">"In</span> this sense the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is strictly expressive of the function which is ascribed to the scapegoat in verses 21, 22; namely, that he <span class="accented">be sent away, bearing upon him all the iniquities of the children of Israel into the wilderness.'</span> It properly denotes one that removes or separates; yet a remover in such sort that the removal is not effected by a single act or at one moment, but by a series of minor acts tending to and issuing in a complete removal. No word could better express the movement of the goat before the eyes of the people, as it passed on, removing at each step, in a visible symbol, their sins further and further from them, until, by continued repetition of the movement, they were carried far away and removed utterly" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). That it is the goat that is designated by the word <span class="accented">azazel</span> is the exposition of the LXX., Josephus, Symmachus, Aquila, Theodotion, the Vulgate, the Authorized English Version, and Luther's Version. The interpretation is founded on sound etymological grounds, it suits the context wherever the word occurs, it is consistent with the remaining ceremonial of the Day of Atonement, and it accords with the otherwise known religious beliefs and symbolical practices of the Israelites. The two goats were the single sin offering for the people; the one that was offered in sacrifice symbolized atonement or covering made by shedding of blood, the other symbolized the utter removal of the sins of the people, which were conveyed away and lost in the depths of the wilderness, whence there was no return. Cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us;" and <a href="../../par/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>, "He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea." The eighth verse should be translated as it stands in the Authorized Version, or, if we ask for still greater exactness, <span class="accented">And Aaron shall east lots upon the two goats</span>; <span class="accented">one lot for the Lord, and one lot for a remover of sins.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</div><div class="comm">

But the goat, upon which fell the lot for a remover of sins, shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him, and to send him away for a remover of sins into the wilderness.</span> We are justified in inserting the words, "of sins," after "a remover," because "the use of the word <span class="accented">azal</span>, from which the word rendered by 'remover' is derived, is confined in the Hebrew dialect to the single purpose or institution which is here under consideration; so that this particular word must have conveyed to the mind of a Hebrew hearer or reader this notion of a removal of <span class="accented">sins</span>, and none other" (Sir W. Martin, 'Semitic Languages'). The goat is both <span class="cmt_word">presented before the Lord,</span> and subsequently (verse 20) offered to him, the priest laying his hands upon him and making a confession of the sins of the people. After he has thus become the Lord's, how could he be given up to Satan? The purpose of his being set apart <span class="cmt_word">is to make an atonement with him</span> (not <span class="accented">for him</span>, as some commentators explain it wrongly). As atonement was made by the blood of the sacrificed goat ceremonially covering sin, so it was also made by the live goat symbolically removing sin. But the atonement in both cases has reference to God. How could an atonement be made by an offering to Satan, unless Satan, not God, was the being whose wrath was to be propitiated, and with whom reconciliation was sought?

Here we see taught the lesson of the vision of God, as he is, being impossible to the human faculties. He must be vailed in one way or another. After passing through the outer chamber of the tabernacle, the high priest found himself in the smaller chamber where stood the ark. Immediately he threw the incense on the coals of the censer, until the holy of holies was filled with the smoke, after which, according to later practice, he offered a prayer outside the vail. The following form of prayer, breathing, however, the spirit of ages long subsequent to the tabernacle, or even the first temple, is found in the Talmud: -  "May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that neither this day nor this year any captivity come upon us. Yet if captivity befall us this day or this year, let it be to a place where the Law is cultivated. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that want come not upon us this day or this year. But if want visit us this day or this year, let it be due to the liberality of our charitable deeds. May it please thee, O Lord, the God of our fathers, that this year may be a year of cheapness, of fullness, of intercourse and trade; a year with abundance of rain, of sunshine, and of dew; one in which thy people Israel shall not require assistance one from another. And listen not to the prayers of those who are about to set out on a journey (against rain). And as to thy people Israel, may no enemy exalt himself against them. May it please thee, O Lord our God, the God of our fathers, that the houses of the men of Saron (exposed to floods) may not become their graves" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service').

Accordingly, the high priest proceeds to do <span class="cmt_word">so for the tabernacle of the congregation,</span> that is, to make a similar atonement by similar means outside the vail as he had made inside it. He would therefore have made one sprinkling with the blood upon the vail, and seven sprinklings before it, after which he placed the blood upon the horns of the altar of incense, according to the command given in <a href="../../par/exodus/30-10.htm">Exodus 30:10</a>.

Even on the Day of Atonement the dwelling-place of God, typical of heaven, was closed to the eye and foot of man, "the way into the holiest of all being not yet made manifest" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/9-8.htm">Hebrews 9:8</a>), until the Divine High Priest opened the way for his people by his own entrance.

It was not enough that the defilement of the sanctuary should be covered, and the sins of the priests and people atoned for by the blood of the sacrifices. There remained a consciousness of sin. How was this to be taken away? To effect this, Aaron proceeds to the unique ceremony of the day by which the utter removal of sin from the reconciled people is typified. <span class="cmt_word">He shall bring the live goat;</span> this should be translated <span class="accented">offer the live goat.</span> It is the word used above for the <span class="accented">offering</span> of the goat that was slain, and it is the word always used for offering sacrifices to the Lord. The first goat had been offered in the usual manner, the offerer laying his hand on his head and perhaps praying over him. Now the second goat is offered, the high priest having to <span class="cmt_word">lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,...  putting them upon the head of the goat.</span> The confession of sins, at first extempore, would naturally, as time progressed, become stereotyped into a liturgical form, as it is found in the Mishna: "O Lord, they have committed iniquity; they have transgressed; they have sinned, - thy people, the house of Israel. O Lord, cover over, I entreat thee, their iniquities, their transgressions, and their sins, which they have wickedly committed, transgressed, and sinned before thee,  - thy people, the house of Israel. As it is written in the Law of Moses thy servant, saying, ' For on that day shall it be covered over for you, to make you clean; from all your sins before the Lord ye shall be cleansed'" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service '). During this confession of sins the people remained prostrate in humiliation and prayer in the court of the tabernacle, and it was the custom of the high priest to turn towards them as he pronounced the last words, "Ye shall be cleansed." At the conclusion of the confession, the high priest handed over the goat to a fit man, that is, to a man who was standing ready to take charge of him, and <span class="cmt_word">sent him away by his hand into the wilderness.</span>

The goat is to bear the iniquities of the people <span class="cmt_word">unto a land not inhabited.</span> The latter words - in the original, <span class="accented">eretz gezerah - would</span> be more correctly translated, <span class="accented">a laud cut off</span>, that is, completely isolated from the surrounding country by some barrier of rock or torrent, which would make it impossible for the goat to come back again. Thus the sins were utterly lost, as though they had never been, and they could not return to the sanctified people. The Hebrew word <span class="accented">gazar</span>, to cut (<a href="../../par/1_kings/3-25.htm">1 Kings 3:25</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/136-18.htm">Psalm 136:18</a>), is represented in Arabic by <span class="accented">jazara</span>, and the substantive <span class="accented">gezerah</span> by <span class="accented">jaziruh</span>, which means an island, or an area surrounded by rivers. The word is still in use in countries where Arabic is spoken, as the designation of a district divided from the neighbouring territories by rivers cutting it off, and making it a sort of island or peninsula. Into such a district as this, the man who led the goat was <span class="cmt_word">to let him go.</span> In later times, contrary to the spirit of the Mosaic appointment, the goat was pushed over a projecting ledge of rock, and so killed, a device of man clumsily introduced for the purpose of perfecting a symbolism of Divine appointment. It was more in accordance with the original institution that "the arrival of the goat in the wilderness was immediately telegraphed by the waving of flags, from station to station, till a few minutes after its occurrence it was known in the temple, and whispered from ear to ear, that the goat had borne upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). Both the goat that was sacrificed and the goat that served as remover of sins typified Christ. The first presents him to our faith as the Victim on the cross, the other as the Sin-bearer on whom the Lord laid "the iniquity of us all" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>). "The reason for making use of two animals is to be found purely in the physical impossibility of combining all features that had to be set forth in the sin offering in one animal" (Keil).

On this day, therefore, as on the weekly sabbath, it was not permitted to collect manna (<a href="../../par/exodus/16-26.htm">Exodus 16:26</a>), or to plough or reap (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-21.htm">Exodus 34:21</a>), or to light a fire (<a href="../../par/exodus/35-3.htm">Exodus 35:3</a>), or to gather wood (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-32.htm">Numbers 15:32-36</a>), or to carry corn or fruit (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-15.htm">Nehemiah 13:15</a>), or to sell food or other goods (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/13-16.htm">Nehemiah 13:16</a>), or to bear burdens (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-22.htm">Jeremiah 17:22, 23</a>), or to set out grain for sale (<a href="../../par/amos/8-5.htm">Amos 8:5</a>). And these regulations applied to <span class="cmt_word">strangers that sojourned among them</span> as well as to themselves. It was <span class="cmt_word">a sabbath of rest</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">sabbath of sabbatism.</span> The purpose of the abstinence from food and labour was to bring the soul of each individual into harmony with the solemn rites of purification publicly performed not by themselves, but by the high priest.

The first part of the book contains the institution or regulation of the sacrificial system (chapters 1-7). This chapter, therefore, which gives injunctions as to the place where all sacrifices are to be offered, might well, as Knobel has remarked, have taken its place as chapter 8. The second part contains the institution of the hereditary priesthood (chapters 8-10). This chapter, therefore, which forbids for the future all offering of sacrifices in the open fields, and commands that they shall be brought "unto <span class="accented">the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,"</span> would still more fitly find its place after chapter 10. But the first two sections of the third part (chapters 11-16) contain the laws and rules respecting cleansing from ceremonial defilement, and this cleansing is to be mainly effected by the means of sacrifice. Therefore the rule as to the place where sacrifice shall be offered is most naturally given here, where it is found (chapter 17), forming a close not only to Parts I and II, but also to the two sections of Part III, which contain the regulations as to purification by sacrifice. It is altogether a mistake to make a Second Book begin with chapter 17, as is clone by Lange and Keil. The first injunction contained in the chapter (verses 2-7) is very generally understood to mean that while the Israelites lived in the wilderness, all animals fit for sacrifices which were slain for food should be so far regarded as sacrifices that they should be brought to the door of the tabernacle and slain in the court, an offering of the blood and fat being made to the Lord. Thus the ordinary slaughtering of domestic animals, it is said, became sanctified, and the dignity of life made clear: God is the Lord of life; he gave it, and it must not be taken away unless the blood, which is the vehicle of life, be offered to him by being presented sacrificially on his altar, or, where this is not possible, as in the case of wild animals, by being reverently covered with earth. Such a rule as this respecting the slaughtering of domestic animals, difficult to carry out in any case, would become impossible to obey after the camp had been expanded into a nation, and it is therefore supposed that it is by anticipation repealed in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-15.htm">Deuteronomy 12:15</a> ("Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee"), while the regulations as to restricting the offering of sacrifice to the court of the temple, and as to pouring blood on the earth, are there emphatically enforced. This view of the text is erroneous, and must be rejected. The injunction dues not refer to the ordinary slaughter of domestic animals for food, but only to sacrifices. Hitherto it had been the right and the duty of the head of each family to offer sacrifice for his household, and this he did wherever he thought proper, according to the ancient patriarchal practice, and most naturally in the open fields. This duty and liberty is now abolished. The Aaronic priesthood has superseded the older priestly system, and henceforth every sacrifice is to be offered in the court of the tabernacle, and by the hand of Aaron's sons. The change was most momentous, but it could not but be made after the consecration of Aaron and his sons for an hereditary priesthood. A second reason for the change being made was the immediate danger to which a rude and superstitious people was exposed, of offering the parts which they were bound to set aside for the altar of God to some other deity, if God's priests and altar were not at hand. The imaginations of the Israelites, corrupted by their stay in Egypt, peopled the fields with beings answering to the Pan and the satyrs of the Greeks; and to these the sacred portions of the animals slaughtered elsewhere than at the tabernacle were offered.

But it is always permissible to use a generic in place of a specific term, and its use proves nothing. Probably the sacred writer uses it as a less sacred term, and therefore more suitable to sacrifices offered to the spirits of the fields and woods. If ordinary slaughtering were meant, there is no reason why pigeons and turtle-doves should not be added to the <span class="accented">ox, or lamb, or goat.</span> That every ox, <span class="accented">or lamb, or goat</span>, to be killed <span class="cmt_word">in the camp, or...  out of the camp,</span> for the food of more than 600,000 men, should be brought to so confined a space as the court of the tabernacle for slaughter, where the animals for the daily, weekly, annual, and innumerable private sacrifices were also killed, appears almost credible in itself. How would the drivers have made their way into it? and what would have soon been the state of the court? It is true that animal food was not the staple sustenance of the Israelites in the wilderness; but not unfrequently, after a successful war or raid, there must have been a vast number of cattle killed for feasting or reserved for subsequent eating.

It follows that the command refers to sacrifice, not to mere slaughtering. Clark, taking the opposite view of the command, is obliged to change the translation, <span class="accented">sacrifices which they offer in the open field</span>, into "beasts for slaughter which they now slaughter in the open field" ('Speaker's Commentary'); but he has no authority for doing so. <span class="accented">Zabach</span> means always, in the Pentateuch, to slay in sacrifice. These field sacrifices, when offered to the Lord in the proper place and with the proper ceremonies, would become peace offerings unto the Lord.

It is generally supposed that the Israelites borrowed their worship of the goat-like spirits of the woods and fields from Egypt. That goat-worship prevailed there in a very foul shape we know (Herod., 2:42), but sacrifices in the open fields are rather a Persian habit (Herod., 1:132). Pan-worship, however, was common to most if not to all agricultural nations. The injunction which follows, This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations, which cannot be confined to the last few words or verses, shows that the command of verse 3 refers to sacrifices, not to ordinary slaughtering. Had slaughtering been meant, the statute could not have been intended to be more than temporary in its obligation. The importance attributed to the regulation is further shown by the declaration previously made, that whoever transgressed it should be <span class="accented">cut off from among his people</span>, or excommunicated. In fact, it makes an era in the history of the chosen people. The old patriarchal priesthood having ceased, and the Aaronic priesthood substituted for it, the tabernacle is appointed to serve as a religious centre to the race. Whenever, from this time onwards, sacrifices were offered, without offense, elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle or temple, as by Samuel (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a>), and by Elijah (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-32.htm">1 Kings 18:32</a>), it was done by the direct order or dispensation of God.

"But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat," was given as a command to Noah (<a href="../../par/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). It has already been repeated twice in the Book of Leviticus (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>), and it is still again found in chapter Leviticus 19:26; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-16.htm">Deuteronomy 12:16</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>. The present is the <span class="accented">locus classicus</span> which explains the earnestness with which the rule is enforced. It begins with an extension of the obligation from the Israelites to the sojourners among them, and with a solemn declaration that, in case of transgression, God will take into his own bands the punishment of the offenders; not only is he to be cut off or excommunicated by political or ecclesiastical authority, but God himself will <span class="cmt_word">set his face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people,</span> by death, or such means as he chooses to adopt. Then follows the reason for the prohibition. <span class="cmt_word">For the life of the flesh is in the blood.</span> The blood may not be eaten because it is the vehicle of life, literally, <span class="accented">the soul of the flesh</span>, that is, it is the seat of the animal life of the body. "It is the fountain of life," says Harvey; "the first to live, the last to die, and the primary seat of the animal soul; it lives and is nourished of itself, and by no other part of the human body." In consequence of possessing this character, it is to be reserved, <span class="cmt_word">to make an atonement for your souls upon the altar;</span> for thus only blood became qualified for the purpose of atonement. The clause, <span class="cmt_word">for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul,</span> should be translated, <span class="accented">for the blood maketh atonement by means of the soul, i.e.</span>, by means of the life which it contains. It is because the blood is the vehicle of the animal's life, and represents that life, that it serves to cover, or make atonement for, the soul of the offerer of the sacrifice, who presents it instead of his own life. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a></div><div class="verse">For the life of the flesh <i>is</i> in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it <i>is</i> the blood <i>that</i> maketh an atonement for the soul.</div><div class="comm">
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/17-12.htm">Leviticus 17:12</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - This verse emphatically restates that the atoning power of the blood, as being the seat of life, is the reason that the eating of it is forbidden, and the same statement is repeated in a different connexion in verse 14. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/17-13.htm">Leviticus 17:13</a></div><div class="verse">And whatsoever man <i>there be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13, 14.</span> - Negatively, it has been ordered that blood shall not be eaten; positively, that it is to be offered to God. But there may be cases where the latter command cannot be caused out, as when animals are killed in hunting. On such occasions the man who kills the animal, whether he be an Israelite or a sojourner, is to <span class="cmt_word">pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust,</span> regarding it as a sacred thing. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/17-14.htm">Leviticus 17:14</a></div><div class="verse">For <i>it is</i> the life of all flesh; the blood of it <i>is</i> for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh <i>is</i> the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.</div><div class="comm">

The blood of an animal may not have been shed, or not shed in such a way as to make it flow abundantly, as when the animal has died a natural death, or been killed by wild beasts. In this case, as the blood still remains in the body, the flesh may not be eaten without defilement.

The prohibition of the eating of blood was continued by the Council of Jerusalem, but the observance of the regulation was no longer commanded as a duty binding on all men, but as a concession to Jewish feelings, enabling Jewish and Gentile converts to live together in comfort (see <a href="../../par/1_samuel/14-32.htm">1 Samuel 14:32</a>; Ezekiel 33:35; <a href="../../par/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

MORAL UNCLEANNESS AND ITS PUNISHMENT. This being the subject of the three following chapters (chapters 18-20), they naturally form a sequence to chapters 11-17, which have dealt with ceremonial uncleanness and its purification. It is a remarkable thing that, except by implication in connection with the sin offerings and the trespass offerings and the ceremonies of the Day of Atonement, there has not yet been a single moral precept, as such, in the Book of Leviticus, and there has been very little recognition of sin as distinct from pollution. All has been ceremonial. But the ceremonial is typical of the moral, and from the consideration of ceremonial uncleanness and its remedy, we now proceed to the consideration of moral uncleanness and its penalty. It is to be noticed too that, while the ensuing laws are commanded as the positive injunction of God (verses 2, 30), which of itself is sufficient to give them their authority and force, they are still founded, like the ceremonial prohibitions, upon the feelings of repugnance implanted in the mind of man. To enter into the marriage relation with near relatives is abhorrent to a sentiment in mankind so widely spread that it may be deemed to have been originally universal, and the same abhorrence is entertained towards other foul sins of lust. Ugliness, which creates disgust by its ugliness, symbolizes sin; immorality, which inspires abhorrence by its immoral character, proves itself thereby to be sin. The section deals first with sin in the marriage relation, next with sexual impurities connected with marriage, then with other cases of immorality, and lastly with the penalties inflicted on these sins in their character of crimes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-5</span> form an introduction to the Hebrew code of prohibited degrees of marriage and of forbidden sins of lust. The formal and solemn declaration, <span class="cmt_word">I am the Lord your God</span>, is made three times in these five verses. This places before the people the two thoughts: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the Lord is holy, and they ought to be like him in holiness; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the Lord has commanded holiness, and they ought to obey him by being holy. Because the Lord is their God, and they are his people, they are, negatively, to refrain from the vicious habits and lax customs prevalent in <span class="cmt_word">the land of Egypt wherein they dwelt</span>, and in the land of Canaan whither they were going, the sensuality of which is indirectly condemned by the injunctions which command purity in contrast to their <span class="cmt_word">doings</span>; and, positively, they are to <span class="cmt_word">keep God's statutes, and his judgments</span>, as laid down in the following code, <span class="cmt_word">which if a man do, he shall live in them</span>. The latter clause is of special importance, because it is repeated in the same connection by Ezekiel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-11.htm">Ezekiel 20:11, 13, 21</a>), and in the Levitical confession in the Book of Nehemiah (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>), and is quoted by St. Paul in a controversial sense (<a href="../../par/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>). Its full meaning is that by obedience to God's commands man attains to a state of existence which alone deserves to be called true life - "the life which connects him with Jehovah through his obedience" (Clark). And this involves the further truth that disobedience results in death. Accordingly, St. Paul uses the text as being the testimony of the Law with regard to itself, that salvation by it is of works in contrast with faith. (Cf. <a href="../../par/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>.) We have no evidence to tell us what were <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Canaan</span> in respect to the marriage relation, but this chapter is enough to show that the utmost laxity prevailed in it, and we may be sure that their religious rites, like those of Midian (<a href="../../par/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>), were penetrated with the spirit of licentiousness. With regard to <span class="accented">the doings of the land of Egypt</span>, we have fuller information. We know that among the Egyptians marriage with sisters and half-sisters was not only permissible, but that its propriety was justified by their religious beliefs, and practiced in the royal family (Died. Sic., 1:27; Die. Cass., 42). Other abominations condemned in this chapter (verse 23) also, as we know, existed there (Herod., 2:46), and if queens could be what in later times Cleopatra was, we may imagine the general dissoluteness of the people. Among Persians, Medes, Indians, Ethiopians and Assyrians, marriage with mothers and daughters was allowed, and from the time of Cambyses, marriage with a sister was regarded as lawful (Herod., 3:31). The Athenians and Spartans permitted marriage with half-sisters. All these concessions to lust, and ether unclean acts with which the heathen world was full (verse 22; <a href="../../par/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>), were fallings away from the law of purity implanted in the heart of man and now renewed for the Hebrew people.

The positive law of marriage, as implanted in the human heart, would be simply that any man of full age might marry any woman of full age, provided that both parties were willing. But this liberty is at once controlled by a number of restrictions, the main purpose of which is to prevent incest, which, however much one nation may come to be indifferent to one form of it, and another to another, is yet abhorrent to the feelings and principles of mankind. The Hebrew restrictive law is contained in one verse. <span class="cmt_word">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness: I am the Lord.</span> All that follows (verses 9-18) is simply an amplification and an explanation of the words, <span class="accented">near of kin to him.</span> These words would be literally rendered, <span class="accented">flesh of his flesh</span>, or less probably (as in the margin), <span class="accented">remainder of his flesh.</span> They certainly include within the compass of their meaning those that are near by affinity, as much as those that are near by consanguinity. This is proved by the instances given below, where no difference is drawn between blood relations and relations by marriage, the latter being supposed to become the former, in consequence of the marriage that has taken place. Nearness of kin is generally counted by "degrees;" but, unfortunately, this word is itself ambiguous, for it is used in different senses by canonists and by civilians. So far as the direct line is concerned, the same method of calculation is observed by the canon and by the civil law. There is one degree from the son to the mother, two degrees to the grandmother; one degree from the father to the daughter, two degrees to the granddaughter. But this is not so with the collateral lines. A brother and sister, for example, are regarded by the canon law as in the first degree of kinship, because there is only one step to the father, in whom their blood meets; but the civil lawyers consider them as being in the second degree, because, as they calculate, there is one step from the brother to the father, and a second from the father to the sister. An aunt is, according to the canonists, in the second degree of propinquity, because there are two steps from her nephew to his grandfather, who is likewise her father, in whom their blood unites; but, according to the civilian's calculation, there are three steps, namely, from her nephew to his grandfather, two steps, and a third from that grandfather to his daughter the aunt; and therefore the aunt and nephew are in the third degree of propinquity. The case of an uncle and niece is exactly the same as that of a nephew and aunt. On the same principle, according to the canonists, first cousins are in the second degree of kinship; according to the civilians, in the fourth. Propinquity by affinity is calculated in just the same way; so that the brother's wife is in the same degree of relationship as the brother, and wife's sister as the sister by blood. In the code before us, confirmed by that in Deuteronomy, marriage is forbidden with the following blood relations: mother (verse 7), daughter (verse 17), sister (verse 9; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-22.htm">Deuteronomy 27:22</a>), granddaughter (verse 10), aunt (verses 12, 13; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-19.htm">Leviticus 20:19</a>); and with the following relations by affinity: mother-in-law (verse 17; chapter Leviticus 20:14; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27-23.htm">Deuteronomy 27:23</a>), daughter-in-law (verse 15; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-12.htm">Leviticus 20:12</a>), brother's wife (verse 16; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-21.htm">Leviticus 20:21</a>), stepmother (verse 8; chapter 20:11; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-30.htm">Deuteronomy 22:30</a>; see <a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>), stepdaughter and step-granddaughter (verse 17), uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage (verse 14; <a href="../../par/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20</a>); putting aside for the present the question of who is meant by <span class="accented">a wife to her sister</span>, in verse 18. In these lists, according to the canonists' method of reckoning, the mother, the daughter, and the sister are related in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, the brother's wife, are related in the first degree of affinity. The granddaughter and the aunt are in the second degree of consanguinity; the wife's granddaughter and the uncle's wife in the second degree of affinity. According to the civilians' reckoning, the following would be the degrees of propinquity: - The mother and the daughter would be in the first degree of consanguinity; the wife's mother, the wife's daughter, the stepmother, the daughter-in-law, would be in the first degree of affinity. The sister and the granddaughter would be in the second degree of consanguinity; the brother's wife and the wife's granddaughter would be in the second degree of affinity. The aunt by blood would be in the third degree of consanguinity, and the uncle's wife, or aunt by marriage, would be in the third degree of affinity. The wife's sister, with regard to whom it is questioned whether she is referred to or not in verse 18, is in the first degree of affinity (a man's wife being regarded as himself) according to the canonists' reckoning, and in the second according to the civilians'. There is no mention made in the code of the grandmother, the niece, and the cousin-german. All of these are in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canon law; and according to the civil law, the grandmother would be in the second degree, the niece in the third, and the cousin-german in the fourth. It may reasonably be supposed that by the expression, <span class="accented">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness</span>, intercourse is forbidden between all those who are related by consanguinity or affinity in the first and second degrees according to the canonists' reckoning (except cousins-german, whose case is considered below); in the first, second, and third degrees 'according to the civilians' method of calculating; whether they are mentioned by name in the list or not. It is only by implication, not by direct injunction, that marriage even with a daughter is forbidden (verse 17).

On account of the unity caused by marriage ("they shall be one flesh," <a href="../../par/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), the stepmother's nakedness <span class="cmt_word">is the father's nakedness</span>. The tie of affinity is thus declared to be similar in its effects to the tie of consanguinity. Reuben's sin, by which he forfeited his birthright, is connected with this offense, but is of a more heinous character, as his father was alive at the time of his transgression (<a href="../../par/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). It is one of the sins which Ezekiel enumerates as those which brought the judgment of God on Israel (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>). "That one should have his father's wife" is declared by St. Paul to be "such fornication as is not named among the Gentiles," and to call for the excommunication of the offender (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-5</a>). Adonijah's marriage with Abishag, so strongly resented by Solomon on political grounds, is not denounced as morally reprehensible, probably because Abishag was not the wife of David in such a way as to cause the marriage with his son to be abominable in the eye of the law (cf. <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-4.htm">1 Kings 1:4</a> with <a href="../../par/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Absalom's" going in unto his father's concubines" was regarded as the final act which made reconciliation with his father impossible (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/20-3.htm">2 Samuel 20:3</a>). The history of the Church has shown that marriage with the stepmother has had to be again and again prohibited by Council after Council (see Smith and Cheetham's 'Dictionary of Antiquities,' <span class="accented">s.v.</span> 'Prohibited Degrees').

Tamar's appeal to Amnon, "I pray thee speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee," exhibits to us the poor woman grasping at any argument which might save her from her half-brother's brutality, and does not indicate that such marriages were, in the time of David, permissible (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>). The exact degree of relationship which existed between Abraham and Sarah is not altogether certain (cf. <a href="../../par/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a> with Genesis 11:29). Ezekiel reckons this sin in the catalogue of the iniquities of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>).

Yet this is commanded under certain circumstances in the Book of Deuteronomy, and was practiced in patriarchal times (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>). The following are the circumstances under which it is commanded. "If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother unto her" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>). It has been asked, "How can the same thing be forbidden as immoral in Leviticus, and commanded as a duly in Deuteronomy?" Bishop Wordsworth replies, "In a special case, for a special reason applicable only to the Jews, God was pleased to dispense with that law, and in the plenitude of his omnipotence to change the prohibition into a command....  God cannot command anything that is sinful. For sin is 'transgression of the Law' (<a href="../../par/1_john/3-4.htm">1 John 3:4</a>), and whatever he commands is right. But it would be presumptuous to say that <span class="accented">we</span> may dispense with God's law concerning marriage, because he in one case dispensed with it; as it would be impious to affirm that murder is not immoral, and may be committed by us, bemuse God, who is the sole Arbiter of life and death, commanded Abraham to slay his son Isaac." The levirate marriage was not a concession to the desires of the second brother, but a duty enjoined for a family or tribal purpose, and it was plainly at all times must distasteful. Thus Onan refused to perform his duty to Er's wife (<a href="../../par/genesis/38-9.htm">Genesis 38:9</a>); the legislation in Deuteronomy anticipates objection on the part of the brother, and institutes an in-suiting ceremony to be gone through by him if he declines to do his duty to his dead brother (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9, 10</a>), which we see carried out in some of its details in the case of Ruth's kinsman (<a href="../../par/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7, 10</a>). Indeed, in such a marriage, the second husband seems rather to have been regarded as the continuation of the first husband than as having a substantive existence of his own as a married man. He performed a function in order "that the name of his brother which is dead may not be put out of Israel" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a>), "to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren" (<a href="../../par/ruth/3-10.htm">Ruth 3:10</a>). The second husband's position may be compared to that of the concubine presented by Rachel to her husband. "Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her" (<a href="../../par/genesis/30-3.htm">Genesis 30:3</a>). The whole object of the rule was that, as the elder brother could not keep up the flintily by begetting an heir, the younger brother should do it for him after his death.

But it has been already disposed of by the general command, <span class="accented">None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness.</span> The daughter being nearest of kin, this command was sufficient without further specification. The niece and probably the wife's sister are forbidden by the same general rule (see following note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/18-18.htm">Leviticus 18:18</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex <i>her</i>, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life <i>time</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life</span> time. Do these words refer to the marriage of two sisters or not? It has been passionately affirmed that they do, by those who are opposed to permission being granted for marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and by those who are in favour of that measure, each party striving to derive from the text an argument for the side which they are maintaining. But Holy Scripture ought not to be made a quarry whence partisans hew arguments for views which they have already adopted, nor is that the light in which a commentator can allow himself to regard it. A reverent and profound study of the passage before us, with its context, leads to the conclusion that the words have no bearing at all on the question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and thus it may be removed from the area and atmosphere of angry polemics. It is certain that the words translated <span class="accented">a wife to her sister</span> may be translated, in accordance with the marginal rendering, <span class="accented">one wife to another.</span> The objections made to such a version are arbitrary and unconvincing. It is in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew language to take "father," "son, brother," "sister," in a much wider acceptation than is the case in the Western tongues. Anything that produces or causes is metaphorically a "father;" anything produced or caused is a "son;" any things akin to each other in form, shape, character, or nature, are "brothers" and "sisters." This is the name given to the loops of the curtains of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-3.htm">Exodus 26:3, 5, 6</a>), the tenons of the boards (<a href="../../par/exodus/26-17.htm">Exodus 26:17</a>), and the wings of the cherubim (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-11.htm">Ezekiel 1:11, 23</a>). Indeed, wherever the expression, "a man to his brother," or "a woman to her sister," is used (and it is used very frequently) in the Hebrew Scriptures, it means not two brothers or two sisters, but two things or persons similar in kind. This does more than raise a presumption - it creates a high probability - that the expression should be understood in the same way here. But a difficulty then arises. If the right reading is, <span class="accented">Neither shalt thou take one wife to another</span>, does not the verse forbid polygamy altogether, and is not polygamy permitted by <a href="../../par/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7-11</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/21-15.htm">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>? Certainly, if so important a restriction was to be made, we should expect it to be made directly, and in a manner which could not be disputed. Is there any way out of the difficulty? Let us examine each word of the Law. <span class="accented">Neither shalt thou take one wife to another, to vex, to uncover her nakedness upon her in her life time.</span> The two words, <span class="accented">to vex</span>, have not been sufficiently dwelt on. The Hebrew, <span class="accented">tsarar</span>, means to distress by packing closely together, and so, to vex, or to annoy in any way. Here is to be found the ground of the prohibition contained in the law before us. A man is not to take for a second wife a woman who is likely, from spiteful temper or for other reasons, to vex the first wife. Rachel vexed Leah; Peninnah vexed Hannah; the first pair were blood relations, the second were not; but under the present law the second marriage would in both cases have been equally forbidden, if the probability of the provocation had been foreseen. It follows that polygamy is not prohibited by the text before us, but that the liberty of the polygamist is somewhat circumscribed by the application of the law of charity. It follows, too, that the law has no bearing on the question of marriage with a deceased wife's sister, which is neither forbidden nor allowed by it. Are we then to conclude that the Law of Moses leaves the case of the wife's sister untouched? Not so, for the general principle has been laid down, None <span class="accented">of you shall approach to any, that is near of kin to him, to uncover his nakedness</span>, and, as we have seen, the expression, <span class="accented">near of kin</span>, includes relations by affinity equally with blood relations; as therefore the wife's sister is in the canonists' first degree of affinity (and in the second according to the civilians), it is reasonably inferred that marriage with her is forbidden under the above law, and this inference is confirmed by marriage with the other sister-in-law - the brother's wife - being, as the rule, prohibited. It can hardly be doubted that marriage with the grandmother and with the niece - both in the second degree of consanguinity according to the canonists, and the third degree according to the civilians - and incest with a daughter are forbidden under the same clause. The present verse completes the Levitical code of prohibited degrees. The Roman code of restrictions on marriage was almost identical with the Mosaic tables. It only differed from them by specifically naming the grandmother and the niece among the blood relations with whom a marriage might not be contracted, and omitting the brother's wife among relatives by affinity. In the time of Claudius, a change was introduced into it, for the purpose of gratifying the emperor's passion for Agrippina, which legalized marriage with a brother's daughter. This legalization con-tinned in force until the time of Constantius, who made marriage with a niece a capital crime. The imperial code and the canon law were framed upon the Mosaic and the Roman tables, and under them no question arose, except as to the marriage of the niece, the decreased wife's sister, and the first cousin. Marriage with the niece was forbidden by Constantius, as we have said, in the year 355, on penalty of capital punishment for committing the offense, and marriage with a deceased wife's sister was declared by the same emperor to be null. The canons of Councils and the declarations of the chief Church teachers are in full accordance with the imperial legislation, condemning these marriages without a dissentient voice. The only ease in which no consensus is found is that of the marriage of first cousins. By the earliest Roman law these marriages had been disallowed (Tacitus, 'Annal.,' 12:6), but in the  <span class="date">second century B.C.</span> they had become common (Livy, 42:34), and they continued to be lawful till the year A.D.  or 385, when Theodosius condemned them, and made them punishable by the severest penalties possible. This enactment lasted only twenty years, when it was repealed by Arcadius, A.D. 404 or 405. No adverse judgment respecting the marriage of first cousins was pronounced by the Church until after the legislation of Theodosius, but it appears that that legislation was promoted at her instance, and from that time forward the tendency to condemn these marriages became more and more pronounced. See the canons of the Councils of Agde, Epaone, Auvergne, Orleans, Tours, Auxerre, in the sixth century, and of the Council in Trullo in the seventh century. The reformers of the sixteenth century in England, entrenching themselves, as usual, behind the letter of Scripture and the practice of the primitive Church, forbade marriages of consanguinity and affinity in the first, second, and third degrees according to the reckoning of the civil law, and in the first and second degrees according to the reckoning of the canon law, excepting those of first cousins, on which the early Christians pronounced no decisive judgment.

What was the nature and purpose of the idolatrous rite in question is, however, uncertain. It is generally assumed that reference is made to the practice of offering children in sacrifice to Molech, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20</a>, and <a href="../../par/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a> being quoted in support of that view. But it is by no means certain that this was the case. It might have been a rite by which children were dedicated to Molech - a baptism by fire, not resulting in the death of the child. Its mention here, in close connection with carnal sins, has led some to regard it as an impure rite; but this is a mistaken inference, for the prohibition of adultery naturally suggests the prohibition of a spiritual unfaithfulness. That it was some kind of idolatrous ceremony is shown by the addition of the words, <span class="cmt_word">neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God.</span> But if the children were burnt to death in honour of the idol, from the beginning, we should expect to find a notice of the fact in less ambiguous language than the expression, <span class="accented">pass through the fire</span>, conveys, earlier than the days of Ahaz. It is easy to imagine that what began as a dedication ceremony may have become converted into an absolute sacrifice, retaining still its original designation. Molech was a Canaanitish and Phoenician deity, the name meaning King, just as Baal means Lord (see Selden, 'De Diis Syris,' 1:6). Jarchi, quoted by Wordsworth, describes the idol as "made of brass, having the face of an ox, with arms stretched out, in which the child was placed and burnt with fire, while the priests were beating drums, in order to drown the noise of its shrieks, lest the fathers might be moved with pity thereby." The place where the children were offered, in the later period of the Jewish history, was the valley of Hinnom (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>).

Chapter 19 may be regarded as an extension of the previous chapter in this direction, after which the subject of chapter 18, is again taken up in chapter 20. The precepts now given are not arranged systematically, though, as Keil has remarked, "while grouped together rather according to a loose association of ideas than according to any logical arrangement, they are all linked together by the common purpose expressed in the words, <span class="accented">Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.' "</span> They begin by inculcating (in verses 3, 4) duties which fall under the heads of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the fifth commandment of the Decalogue, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the fourth, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the first, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the second. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>These four laws are, in their positive aspects, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the religious law of social order, on which a commonwealth rests; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the law of positive obedience to God's command because it is his command; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the law of piety towards the invisible Lord; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> the law of faith, which trusts him without requiring risible emblems or pictures of him. In verses 11, 14, 16, 35, 36, obedience is inculcated to the eighth and the ninth commandments, which are the laws of honesty and of truthfulness; in verse 12 to the third commandment, which is the law of reverence; in verses 17, 18, 33, 34, to the sixth commandment, which is the law of love; in verses 20, 29, to the seventh commandment, which is the law of purity; in verses 9, 10, 13, the spirit of covetousness is prohibited, as forbidden in the tenth commandment, which is the law of charity. Thus this chapter may in a way be regarded as the Old Testament counterpart of the Sermon on the Mount, inasmuch as it lays down the laws of conduct, as the latter lays down the principles of action, in as comprehensive though not in so systematic a manner as the ten commandments.

The object of this law is to inculcate a general spirit of mercy, which is willing to give up its own exact rights in kindness to others suffering from want.

The expression, <span class="cmt_word">neither shalt thou gather every grape of thy vineyard,</span> would be more literally rendered, <span class="accented">neither shalt thou gather the scattering of thy vineyard</span>, meaning the berries (grapes or olives)which had fallen or which were left singly on the boughs.

The suffering caused to one who hears the curse creates a further sin by adding an injury to the person addressed. Strangely in contrast with this is not only the practice of irreligious men, who care little how they curse a man in his absence, but the teaching which is regarded by a large body of Christians as incontrovertible. "No harm is done to reverence but by an open manifestation of insult. How, then, can a son sin gravely when he curses his father without the latter's knowing it, or mocks at him behind his back, inasmuch as in that case there is neither insult nor irreverence? And I think that the same is to be said, even though he does this before others. It must be altogether understood that he does not sin gravely if he curses his parents, whether they are alive or dead, unless the curses are uttered with malevolent meaning." This is the decision of one that is called not only a saint, but a "doctor of the Church" (Liguori, 'Theol. Moral.,' 4:334). "Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put ant in obscure darkness," says the Word of God (<a href="../../par/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shalt fear thy God.</span> By the last clause the eye is directed to God, who can see and punish, however little the blind man is able to help himself. (Cf. <a href="../../par/job/29-15.htm">Job 29:15</a>, "I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.")

Thus the effect of the false witness of the two men of Belial against Naboth was that "they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>; cf. <a href="../../par/matthew/26-60.htm">Matthew 26:60</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-4.htm">Matthew 27:4</a>).

So our Lord teaches, "if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him" (<a href="../../par/luke/17-3.htm">Luke 17:3</a>); and he appoints a solemn mode of procedure, by which this fraternal rebuke is to be conveyed in his Church: "If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican" (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>). Therefore St. Paul warns his delegates, Timothy and Titus, "Them that sin rebuke before all" (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>). "Reprove, rebuke" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2</a>). "Rebuke them sharply" (<a href="../../par/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>). "Rebuke with all authority" (<a href="../../par/titus/2-15.htm">Titus 2:15</a>). By withholding reproof in a bitter spirit, or from a feeling of cowardice, we may become partakers of other men's sins. Whoever fails to rebuke his neighbour when he ought to do so, <span class="accented">bears sin on his account</span> (the more correct and less ambiguous rendering of the words translated in the Authorized Version, <span class="cmt_word">suffer sin upon him</span>, cf. <a href="../../par/numbers/18-22.htm">Numbers 18:22, 32</a>).

The first is a mystical injunction against the confusion of things which are best kept apart, illustrated in three subjects - diverse kinds of cattle in breeding, mingled seeds in sowing a field, and mixed materials in garments. In <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>, a fresher illustration is added, "Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together." The existence of mules, which we find frequently mentioned in the' later history (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/13-29.htm">2 Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>), may be accounted for by supposing that the positive precept with regard to breeding cattle here laid down was transgressed, or that the mules were imported from abroad (see <a href="../../par/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). The word used here and in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-11.htm">Deuteronomy 22:11</a> <span class="cmt_word">for a garment mingled of linen and woolen</span>, is <span class="accented">shaatenez</span>, an Egyptian word, meaning probably mixed. The difficulty raised on this verse by the allegation that the high priest's dress was made of mixed materials, is met by the answer that, if it were of mixed materials (which is uncertain, for wool is not mentioned in <a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>, nor is it quite determined that <span class="accented">shesh</span> means linen), the mixture was not such as is here forbidden. The moral meaning of the whole of this injunction is exhibited in the following passages from the New Testament, "Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>). "Be ye <span class="accented">not</span> unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-16</a>). "He cannot love the Lord Jesus with his heart," says Hooker, "who lendeth one ear to his apostles and another to false teachers, and who can brook to see a mingle-mangle of religion and superstition' ('Serm.' 5:7, quoted by Wordsworth). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/19-20.htm">Leviticus 19:20</a></div><div class="verse">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that <i>is</i> a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - A distinction is drawn between adultery with a free woman, or a betrothed free virgin, which was punishable with death (<a href="../../par/leviticus/20-20.htm">Leviticus 20:20</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>), and with a slave betrothed to another man (probably a slave also). In the latter ease a lesser punishment, no doubt that of scourging (according to the Mishna to the extent of forty stripes), was to be inflicted on one or both, according to the circumstances of the case. The words, <span class="cmt_word">she shall he scourged</span>, should be translated, <span class="accented">there shall be investigation</span>, followed, presumably, by the punishment of scourging, for both parties if both were guilty, for one if the woman was unwilling. The man is afterwards to offer a trespass offering. As the offense has been a wrong as well as a sin, his offering is to be a trespass offering (see on Leviticus 5:14). In this case the fine of one-fifth could not be inflicted, as the wrong done could not be estimated by money, and the cost of the ram seems to be regarded as the required satisfaction. No mention is made of damages to be paid to the man to whom the slave-girl was betrothed, probably because he was himself a slave, and had not juridical rights against a freeman.

The first word of the verse, in the original <span class="accented">Vayikra</span>, meaning "and called," has been taken as the designation of the book in the Hebrew Bible. The title Leviticon, or Leviticus, was first adopted by the LXX., to indicate that it had for its main subject the duties and functions appertaining to the chief house of the priestly tribe of Levi. The word "and" connects the third with the second book of the Pentateuch. God is spoken of in this and in the next book almost exclusively under the appellation of "the LORD" or "Jehovah," the word "Elohim" being, however, used sufficiently often to identify the two names. Cf. <a href="../../par/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, 19:12. <span class="cmt_word">And spake unto him</span>. The manner in which God ordinarily communicated with a prophet was by "a vision" or "in a dream;" but this was not the case with Moses; "My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently" (<a href="../../par/numbers/12-8.htm">Numbers 12:8</a>). The Levitical code of laws, therefore, was delivered to Moses in his ordinary mental state, not in trance, or dream, or ecstasy. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span> The tabernacle had just been set up by Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). It derives its name <span class="accented">of the congregation</span>, or rather <span class="accented">of meeting</span>, from being the place where God met the representatives of his people (see <a href="../../par/numbers/16-42.htm">Numbers 16:42</a>). Hitherto God had spoken from the mount, now he speaks from the mercy-seat of the ark in the tabernacle. He had symbolically drawn near to his people, and the sacrificial system is now instituted as the means by which they should draw nigh to him. All the laws in the Book of Leviticus, and in the first ten chapters of the Book of Numbers, were given during the fifty days which intervened between the setting up of the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>) and the departure of the children of Israel from the neighbourhood of Mount Sinai (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/1-2.htm">Leviticus 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, <i>even</i> of the herd, and of the flock.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If any man of you bring.</span> Sacrifices are not now being instituted for the first time. Burnt offerings at least, if not peace offerings, had existed since the time of the Fall. The Levitical law lays down regulations adapting an already existing practice for the use of the Israelitish nation; it begins, therefore, not with a command, "Thou shalt bring," but, <span class="accented">if any man of you</span> (according to custom) <span class="accented">bring.</span> Any member of the congregation might bring his voluntary offering when he would. The times at which the public offerings were to be made, and their number, are afterwards designated. <span class="cmt_word">An offering.</span> This verse is introductory to the ensuing chapters, and speaks of "offerings" in general. "Kor-ban," which is the word here used for "offering," derived from <span class="accented">karab</span>, meaning "to draw near for the sake of presentation," is the generic name including all offerings and sacrifices. It is used in speaking of animal sacrifices of various kinds, including peace offerings and sin offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23</a> and it is applied to vegetable offerings (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 13</a>) and to miscellaneous offerings for the service of the tabernacle, such as wagons and oxen, silver vessels for the altar, gold, jewels, etc. (<a href="../../par/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/31-50.htm">Numbers 31:50</a>). It is translated by the LXX. into Greek by the word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">donum</span>, and our "gift." These offerings are now distinguished into their different kinds.

The conditions to be fulfilled by an Israelite who offered a burnt sacrifice were the following:  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He must offer either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> a young bull without blemish, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> a young ram, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a young he-goat, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> a turtle-dove, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> a young pigeon. 2. In case it were a bull, ram, or goat, he must bring it to the door of the tabernacle, that is, the entrance of the court in front of the brazen altar and of the door of the holy place, and there after or present it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> In offering it he must place his hand firmly on its head, as a ceremonial act. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> He must kill it, either himself or by the agency of a Levite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> He must flay it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> He must divide it into separate portions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">7.</span> He must wash the intestines and legs. Meantime the priests had their parts to do; they had <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To catch the blood, to carry it to the altar, and to strike the inner sides of the altar with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To arrange the fire on the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To place upon the altar the head, and the fat, and the remainder of the animal, for consumption by the fro. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> To sprinkle or place a meat offering upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">5.</span> The next morning, still dressed in their priestly garments, to take the ashes off the altar, and to place them at the east of the altar (chapter 6:10). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">6.</span> To carry them outside the camp to a clean place, the bearer being dressed in his ordinary costume (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-11.htm">Leviticus 6:11</a>). There were, therefore, four essential parts in the ritual of the burnt offering - the oblation of the victim (verses 3, 4), the immolation (verse 5), the oblation of the blood, representing the life (<span class="accented">ibid.</span>), and the consumption (verse 9) - the first two to be performed by the offerer, the third by the priest, the fourth by the fire representing the action of God. The moral lesson taught by the burnt offering was the necessity of self-surrender and of devotion to God, even to the extent of yielding up life and the very tenement of life. As the offerer could not give up his own life and body and still live, the life of an animal belonging to him, and valued by him, was substituted for his own; but he knew, and by laying his hand on its head showed that he knew, that it was his own life and his very self that was represented by the animal. The mystical lessons taught to those who could grasp them were  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The doctrine of substitution or vicarious suffering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The fact that without the shedding of blood there was no acceptance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The need of One who, being very man, should be able to perform an action of perfect surrender of his will and of his life. The fulfilment of the type is found in the perfect submission of Christ as man, throughout his ministry, and especially in the Garden of Gethsemane, and in the offering made by him, as Priest and willing Victim, of his life upon the altar of the cross. the burnt offering is to be <span class="cmt_word">without blemish</span>, for had not the animal been perfect in its kind, it would not have served its moral, its mystical, or its typical purpose. The word <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, used by the LXX. as equivalent to the Hebrew term, is applied to Christ in <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a> and <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; and St. Paul teaches that it is the purpose of God that those who are adopted in Christ should also be "holy and without blemish" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a>). A priest had to certify that the victim was free kern all defects. <span class="cmt_word">He shall offer it of his own voluntary will</span> should rather be translated, <span class="accented">He shall offer it for his own acceptance.</span> The animal, representing the offerer, was presented by the latter in order that he might be himself accepted by the Lord. This aspect of the offering is brought out more clearly by the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, or meat offering, which always accompanied the burnt offering. The place where the presentation took place was <span class="cmt_word">the door of the tabernacle</span>, that is, the space immediately within the eastern entrance into the court of the tabernacle, immediately facing the brazen altar, which stood before the east end of the tabernacle, where was the door or entrance which led into the holy place. "The presenting of the victim at the entrance of the tabernacle was a symbol of the free will submitting itself to the Law of the Lord" (Clarke). Cf. <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>: "I beseech you that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering.</span> This putting, or forcibly leaning, the hand on the victim's head, which is the most essential part of the oblation of the victim, was a symbolical act implying "This animal is now for present purposes myself, and its life is my life." It was this act of identification with the offerer which made it <span class="cmt_word">be accepted for him to make atonement</span> (literally, <span class="accented">covering</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>for him.</span> The sin offering is the sacrifice which especially symbolizes and ceremonially effects atonement, but the idea of atonement is not absent from the burnt sacrifice. The aspect under which atonement is presented here and elsewhere in the Old Testament is that of covering. But it is not the sin that is covered, but the sinner. Owing to his sin, the latter is exposed to the wrath of a just God, but something intervenes whereby he is covered, and he ceases, therefore, to attract the Divine anger and punishment. No longer being an object of wrath, he becomes at once an object of benevolence and mercy. The covering provided by a sacrifice is the blood or life of an animal, symbolically representing the offerer's own life freely surrendered by him <span class="accented">for his acceptance</span>, and typically foreshadowing the blood of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that <i>is by</i> the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall kill the bullock.</span> After having made the presentation, the offerer proceeds to the second part of the sacrifice, the immolation or slaying, which was to be performed <span class="cmt_word">before the Lord</span>, that is, in front of the tabernacle, on the north side of the brazen altar. Then follows the third part of the sacrifice: <span class="cmt_word">the priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar.</span> The priests caught the blood (sometimes the Levites were allowed to do this, <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/30-16.htm">2 Chronicles 30:16</a>), and <span class="accented">sprinkled</span> or rather <span class="accented">threw it round about on the altar</span>, that is, so as to touch all the inner sides of the altar. "A red line all round the middle of the altar marked that <span class="accented">above</span> it the blood of sacrifices intended to be eaten, <span class="accented">below</span> it that of sacrifices wholly consumed, was to be sprinkled" (Edersheim, 'The Temple'). This was in some respects the most essential part of the ceremony, the blood representing the life (chapter 17:11), which was symbolically received at the hands of the offerer, and presented by the priests to God. In the antitype our Lord exercised the function of the sacrificing priest when he presented his own life to the Father, as he hung upon the altar of the cross.

The whole of the remainder of the animal was consumed by the fire of the altar; none of it was eaten by the offerer and his friends as in the peace offerings, or even by the ministers of God as in the sin offerings; it was a whole burnt offering. <span class="cmt_word">His pieces</span>, into which it was to be cut, means the customary pieces.

The fire once kindled was never to be allowed to go out (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-13.htm">Leviticus 6:13</a>). Unless, therefore, these words refer to the first occasion only on which a burnt sacrifice was offered, they must mean "make up the fire on the altar" or it might possibly have been the practice, as Bishop Wordsworth (after Maimonides) supposes, that fresh fire was added to the altar fire before each sacrifice. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/1-8.htm">Leviticus 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that <i>is</i> on the fire which <i>is</i> upon the altar:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priests shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order.</span> The head and the fat are designated by name, because, with the "pieces," they complete the whole of the animal with the exception of the hide.

The word employed is not the common term used for destroying by fire, but means "make to ascend." The life of the animal has already been offered in the blood; now the whole of its substance is "made to ascend" to the Lord. Modern science, by showing that the effect of fire upon the substance of a body is to resolve it into gases which rise from it, contributes a new illustration to the verse. The vapour that ascends is not something different from that which is burnt, but the very thing itself, its essence; which, having ascended, is of a <span class="cmt_word">sweet savour unto the Lord</span>, that is, acceptable and well-pleasing to him. The burnt offering, the meat offering, and the peace offering, are sacrifices of sweet savour (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-2.htm">Leviticus 2:2</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>); the expression is not used with regard to the sin offering and trespass offering. St. Paul applies it to the sacrifice of Christ, in <a href="../../par/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>, "As Christ also loved us, and gave himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour;" thus indicating, in an incidental manner, the connection between the Jewish sacrifices and the sacrifice of Christ, as type and antitype.

No doubt the same place is meant in both cases, but it is specified with more exactness here. On the western side of the altar was the tabernacle, on the east side the heap of ashes (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-16.htm">Leviticus 1:16</a>), on the south side probably the ascent to the altar (see Josephus, 'De Bell.

The pigeon and the turtle-dove were the most easy to procure, as the domestic fowl was at this time unknown to the Hebrews. The first and only allusion in the Bible to the hen occurs in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/13-30.htm">Luke 13:30</a>, nor is there any representation of the domestic fowl in ancient Egyptian paintings. The domicile of the bird was still confined to India. A single pigeon or turtle-dove formed a sacrifice, and there was no rule in respect to sex, as there was in the case of the quadrupeds. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/1-15.htm">Leviticus 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head, and burn <i>it</i> on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The priest shall bring it unto the altar</span>. The difference in the ritual for the burnt sacrifice of fowls is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the offerer is not commanded to lay his hand on the bird. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the altar is the place of maciation, instead of the space on the north side of the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That the priest slays it instead of the offerer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">4.</span> That the blood (owing to its smaller quantity) is pressed out against the side of the altar instead of being caught in a vessel and thrown on it. There is no essential variation here; the analogy of the sacrifice of the animal is followed so far as circumstances permit. It is not certain that the word <span class="accented">malak</span>, translated <span class="accented">wring off his head</span>, means more than <span class="accented">"make</span> an incision with the nail;" but in all probability the head was to be severed and laid on the fire separately, after the manner of the other sacrifices.

For example, the sin of "giving of his seed to Molech," or which is the same thing, "letting any of his seed pass through the fire to Molech," had been forbidden as a sin in chapter Leviticus 18:21; now it is condemned as a crime. The various penalties assigned in this chapter are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">burning with fire</span> (verse 14); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">stoning with stones</span> (verses 2, 27); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> <span class="accented">being put to death</span> in a manner not specified  (verses 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">being cut off from among his people</span>, either by God himself (verses 4, 5, 6) or by an agency not specified (verses 17, 18); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> <span class="accented">bearing his iniquity</span> (verses 17, 19, 20); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> <span class="accented">childlessness</span> (verses 20, 21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The first of these penalties, <span class="accented">burning with fire</span>, does not mean that those on whom it was inflicted were burnt alive, but that their dead bodies were burnt after they had been stoned to death, as in the case of Achan (<a href="../../par/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>). It is the punishment for taking a mother and daughter together into the same harem (verse 14). <span class="accented">Stoning with stones</span> is appointed for crimes which are at once offenses against religion and morals, viz. giving of his seed to Molech (verse 2), and witchcraft (verse 27). The other form of <span class="accented">putting to death</span>, which no doubt was strangling, is the penalty assigned to cursing parents (verse 9), adultery (verse 10), marriage or intercourse with a stepmother (verse 11) or stepdaughter (verse 12), the sin of Sodom (verse 13), and bestiality (verses 15, 16). <span class="accented">Cutting off from his people</span> may be effected either by death (verses 4, 5, and perhaps 6), which is the penalty for Molech-worship, connivance at Molech-worship, and dealing with witches; or by excommunication (verses 17, 18), which was the punishment for intercourse with a sister, or with one who was unclean by reason of her monthly sickness (see <a href="../../par/exodus/31-14.htm">Exodus 31:14</a>). The phrase, <span class="accented">bearing his iniquity</span>, means that the man continues in the state of a criminal until he has been cleansed either by suffering the punishment of his offense or making atonement for it, which sometimes he might, sometimes he might not, do. The man who committed incest with a sister would <span class="accented">"bear</span> <span class="accented">his iniquity"</span> (verse 17), because he would be put in a state of excommunication without permission of restoration by means of sacrificial offerings. And so with the man who took his aunt by blood (verse 19) or by marriage (verse 20) as his wife, - he would not be allowed to recover his status by offering sacrifice. <span class="accented">Childlessness</span>, the punishment for marrying an uncle's or brother's wife, probably means that in those cases the offender's children should not be counted as his own, but should be entered in the genealogical register as his uncle's or his brother's children. (Cf. <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/25-10.htm">Deuteronomy 25:10</a>, where it is noticeable that the penalty is retained, even though the marriage with the brother's wife, which had been prohibited in general, had in the particular case become a duty for family or tribal reasons.) 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a></div><div class="verse">Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever <i>he be</i> of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth <i>any</i> of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - The close connection between <span class="cmt_word">giving of his seed unto Molech</span> and <span class="cmt_word">defiling my sanctuary</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">profaning my holy name</span>, is explained and illustrated by Ezekiel in the judgment on Aholah and Aholibah. "They have caused their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them. Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths. For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they done in the midst of mine house" (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-37.htm">Ezekiel 23:37-39</a>). Not only was the juxtaposition and combination of the worship of Molech and Jehovah an offense to him whose name is Jealous, but at the time that Molech-worship was carried on in the valley of Hinnom, idols were set up in the court of the temple itself, as we learn from the Book of Kings and from Jeremiah. "But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my Name, to defile it. And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which! commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34, 35</a>). And of Manasseh it is related, "He built altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put my Name. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord. And he made his son pass through the fire" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-6</a>).

The penalty is death, and is to be carried out by the proper tribunals, whose business it was to see that the stoning took place. So in Deuteronomy the duty of killing those who entice to idolatry is laid down. "Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shall thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: but thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-8.htm">Deuteronomy 13:8, 9</a>). In the case of Molech-worship God declares that, if the tribunals of the nation fail to adjudge the penalty of death to the offender, he will himself lake the matter into his hands, and cut him off with his family and all that follow him in his sin of unfaithfulness.

The only way in which the nation can recover holiness lost by the sins of its members, is by the punishment of the latter, or by their purification by means of sacrifice, according to the nature of the offense.

The priest may not take part in any funeral rites, the effect of which was legal defilement, except in the case of the death of his father, mother, son, daughter, brother, and unmarried sister. These are all that appear to be mentioned. But what, then, are we to understand regarding his wife? Was the priest allowed to lake part in mourning ceremonies for her or not? It is thought by some that her case is met by verse 4, <span class="cmt_word">But he shall not defile himself,</span> being <span class="cmt_word">a chief man among his people, to profane himself.</span> The literal translation of this verse is. <span class="accented">He shall not be defiled, a lord</span> (<span class="accented">haul</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> The word <span class="accented">baal</span>, or <span class="accented">lord</span>, is commonly used in the sense of <span class="accented">husband.</span> The clause, therefore, may be understood to forbid the priest to mourn for his wife, being rendered, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as an husband</span> (i.e., <span class="accented">for his wife</span>) <span class="accented">among his people.</span> This, however, is something of a forced rendering. The words arc better understood to mean, <span class="accented">He shall not defile himself as a master of a house among his people</span>; that is, he may not lake part in the funeral rites of slaves or other members of the household, which ordinarily brought defilement on the master of a house. Then is the priest forbidden to mourn for his wife? This we can hardly believe, when he might mourn for father and mother, son and daughter, brother and sister. Nor is it necessary to take this view. For the case of the wife is covered by the words. <span class="cmt_word">For his kin, that is near unto him....  he may be defiled.</span> The wife, being so closely attached to the husband, is not specifically named, because that was not necessary, but is included under the expression, <span class="accented">his kin, that is near unto him</span>, just as daughter, grandmother, niece, and wife's sister, are covered by the phrase, "near of kin," without being specifically named in chapter Leviticus 18 (see note on chapter Leviticus 16:18). Even when mourning is permitted, the priest is to use no excessive forms of it, still less any that have been used by idolaters. <span class="cmt_word">They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-27.htm">Leviticus 19:27</a>), <span class="cmt_word">nor make any cuttings in their flesh</span> (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). And the reason why they are to avoid ceremonial uncleanness in some cases, and to act with sobriety and gravity in all, is that they are dedicated to God, <span class="cmt_word">to offer the offerings of the Lord made by fire, the bread of their God;</span> that is, the sacrifices which are consumed by the fire of the altar symbolizing the action of God (see note on Leviticus 3:11).

Nor is it enough that he should abstain from taking an immoral or a divorced wife; he may only wed <span class="cmt_word">a virgin and of his own people,</span> whereas the other priests might marry widows and the daughters of strangers dwelling among the Israelites.

At these times they are here instructed that they must abstain from their priestly functions, and not even eat of the priests' portions until they have been cleansed. The command to <span class="cmt_word">Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel</span>, in verse 2, must be read in the light of the following verses, and understood to mean that they are <span class="accented">to separate themselves from the holy things</span> when they are unclean. The different forms of uncleanness which are to produce this effect are enumerated in verses 4-6. In most cases the uncleanness would not last beyond sunset on the day on which it was incurred, but occasionally, as when a priest became a leper, a permanent disqualification would be caused, or one that lasted for a considerable length of time. The law with respect to abstaining from holy things while unclean is to be of permanent obligation. Whoever disobeys it is to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from God's presence</span>; that is, he is to be excluded from the sanctuary by being deprived of his priestly office. Verse 8 repeats the prohibition of eating flesh containing blood.

In the fifth chapter a trespass offering of a ram is also ordered, which, though not specified, is probably understood here also.

The rendering of the Authorized Version is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord; or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the Lord do sanctify them.</span> If this rendering is accepted, it would mean that the priests are not to profane the holy things by any irregularity on their part as to the eating of them, nor to suffer laymen to incur the guilt of a trespass by eating them. The marginal rendering, which is to be preferred, gives the passage as follows: <span class="accented">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">or lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass in their eating.</span> According to this translation, the meaning would be that laymen (who had been spoken of in the previous verse) should not profane the holy things, or become guilty of a trespass (as defined in verse 15) by eating them. Technically and literally, David was guilty of this trespass in an aggravated form, when he and his followers ate the shewbread at Nob (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>), for the shewbread was not only holy, but most holy. But his act is excused by our Lord, on the plea of necessity (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3, 4</a>), even though it was done on the sabbath day (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>, margin).

THIS Part consists of chapters 23, and 25, with chapter 24 parenthetically introduced. Every religion must have its round of holy days and seasons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To give occasion for manifesting joyous thankfulness to the Giver of all good things. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> To keep alive the memory of past events around which religious associations cling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> To impress upon the hearts of the worshippers those sacred mysteries which are regarded as essential characteristics of the system. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The duty and happiness of rejoicing before the Lord find a prominent place under the Mosaic dispensation, as they must in any religion where man feels himself in a covenant relation with God, brought nigh to him by himself, and no longer estranged from him who is his only true life and happiness. Accordingly, the first thought of the annual Jewish festivals is that of joyous thankfulness, such as is becoming to reconciled children grateful to their Father for the many bounties that they receive at his hands. The first gift of God of which man becomes conscious is that of the daily sustenance provided for him, and therefore we should expect holy days to be appointed to commemorate the goodness of God in bestowing the gifts of the earth. The first aspect, therefore, in which to regard the three great annual festivals - the Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles - is that they were days of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth dispensed by God to man. First, with regard to the Passover. We read at verses 10, 11, <span class="accented">"When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf</span> [or <span class="accented">an omer</span>] <span class="accented">of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it."</span> The words, "the morrow after the sabbath," mean, as we shall see, the day after the first day of Unleavened Bread, that is, the second day of the feast, Nisan 16, which fell early in April, when the first barley was ripening in Palestine. On the 14th day of Nisan (the day of the Paschal sacrifice) a certain quantity of standing barley was marked off, by men specially appointed for the purpose, in a field ploughed the previous autumn and sown at least ten weeks before the Passover, but not prepared artificially in such a way as to hasten the crop. On the following day, Nisan 15, at sunset, three men were sent to the selected field, and, in the presence of witnesses, cut the ears of corn before marked, and brought them into the temple. On the next day, Nisan 16, this corn, whether in the form of a sheaf or of flour, was offered to the Lord by being waved before him, and then consigned to the priest. Here, by the presentation of the firstfruits of the year, an acknowledgment is made that the products of the earth are by right God's. This is one of the objects of the Feast of the Passover. Secondly, as to Pentecost. After the sheaf, or omer, had been offered on Nisan 16, it was allowable to make the new year's barley into bread, but the dedication of the grain crops was not complete until a portion of the wheat crop had also been offered. This was done a week of weeks later, at the Feast of Pentecost, forty-nine days after the presentation of the barley, and fifty days after the first day of Unleavened Bread. On this day, two leavened loaves, of the same size as the shewbread loaves, were waved before the Lord, and then delivered to the priest. These loaves were made out of ears of corn selected and reaped as the barley had been seven weeks before, and then threshed and ground in the temple. They were regarded as the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, though they were not made of the first cut wheat; and from their presentation the festival has the name of the Feast of Harvest (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>); the Feast of the Firstfruits of the Wheat Harvest (Exodus 24:22); the Day of the Firstfruits (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-26.htm">Numbers 28:26</a>); while, from its date relatively to the Passover, it is called the Feast of Weeks (<a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>). The name, Feast of Pentecost, is found only in the Apocrypha (Tobit 2:1; 2 Macc. 12:32), and in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>). The meat offerings might not be made of the new year's flour until these two loaves had been offered. Thirdly, with regard to the Feast of Tabernacles. The festivals connected with the seasons of the year and the products of the soil were not ended until the Feast of Ingathering (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>), or Tabernacles (verse 34; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a>; <a href="../../par/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-2.htm">Jeremiah 7:2</a>), had been celebrated. This festival occurred about the beginning of October, and commemorated the final gathering in of all the fruits of the year, specially of the olives and the grapes. It was observed by a general dwelling in booths made of the branches of palms, willows, olives, pines, myrtles, and other close-growing trees (verse 40; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>), in which all the Israelite males, with the exception of the sick, lived for seven days, and kept harvest home. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The second aspect in which to regard the annum festivals is the historical one. The <span class="accented">Passover</span> is characterized by its historical associations to a greater degree than either of the other festivals. The whole national life of the Israelites received its character from the Egyptian Exodus, and accordingly the anniversaries of their religious year began with its commemoration. It was the events which had taken place in Egypt which gave to the Paschal sacrifice and the Paschal feast their primary signification; and while to us the Passover festival serves as a proof of the truth of those events, to the Jew it served as a memorial of them, preventing them from ever being forgotten or disregarded (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3-16</a>). The ancient Christian Fathers suggested that the <span class="accented">Feast of Pentecost</span> commemorated the institution of the old dispensation at Sinai, as, to Christians, it recalled the institution of the new Law by the gift of the fiery tongues at Jerusalem. This suggestion was adopted by Maimonides and the later school of Hebrew commentators, and it is a very probable conjecture; but as no appearance of it is found in the Old or New <span class="accented">Testaments</span>, nor even in early Hebrew writers, it cannot be regarded as a certainty. Historically, the <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span> is generally considered to commemorate the dwelling in tents throughout the forty years' wandering in the wilderness; but if this were so, it would have been called the Feast of Tents, for the words "tent" and "tabernacle" differ, and the Israelites did not dwell in tabernacles in the wilderness. Rather, it commemorates the first encampment of the Israelites after setting forth from Egypt, which took place at "Succoth," the meaning of which word is "tabernacle" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>). Thus, as the event historically associated with the first harvest festival, the Passover, was the setting forth from Egypt, that associated with the last, the Feast of Tabernacles, was the resting at the end of the first day's journey at Succoth, where the people now felt that they were free, and began to rejoice in their freedom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The typical character of the feasts, as well as their historical character, is more apparent in the <span class="accented">Passover</span> than in the other two feasts. St. Paul's testimony on this point is sufficient: "For even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us: therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). Here we have the typical character of the Paschal lamb, and of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, authoritatively declared to us. The blood of the lamb slain on the night before the Exodus, being the means whereby the Israelites were delivered from the destruction which fell on all the rest of the inhabitants of the land, typified the still more efficacious bloodshedding by which the redemption of Christ's people was wrought. The <span class="accented">Feast of Pentecost</span>, if it commemorated the gift of the Law at Mount Sinai, pointed thereby to the giving of the better Law on the day when the Holy Ghost descended upon the apostles in Jerusalem; and in any case, as a Feast of Firstfruits, it was emblematic of those firstfruits of the Christian Church presented to God on that day (<a href="../../par/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>). The <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span>, in which God's people commemorated their rejoicing in their newly found liberty after the slavery of Egypt, awaits its full typical fulfillment in the spiritual joy of the redeemed after they have been delivered from the burden of the flesh and the sufferings of the world; but its typical meaning is partially fulfilled in the blessed peace and joy spread abroad in the hearts of the children of God by reason of their adoption in Christ, whereby we have obtained an inheritance with the saints (<a href="../../par/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11, 18</a>). In the annual fast held on the 10th of Tisri, the great Day of Atonement, the typical element outweighs any other. The present and the past sink away in comparison with the future. The day suggests no thought of the seasons or of the products of the earth, and it recalls no event of past history. It teaches a lesson - the need of reconciliation; and by the entrance of the high priest into the holy of holies with sacrificial blood, and by the ceremony of the scapegoat, it typically foreshadows how that reconciliation is to he effected. The monthly festivals had a purpose different from the annual. They occurred on the new moon, or the first day of each month, and their intention was to dedicate each month to God. Only one of these monthly festivals is mentioned in this chapter the Feast of Trumpets. It is the feast of the new moon of the sacred seventh month, with which the civil year began. Because it was New Year's Day, it had more ceremonies attached to it than the first days of the other months. Whereas the feasts of the new moons in other months only sanctified the special month which they began, the Feast of Trumpets sanctified also the whole year, and was therefore an annual as well as a monthly feast. The weekly festival was the sabbath (see <a href="../../par/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>). This feast sanctified each week, as the monthly feasts sanctified each month; and like the annual festivals, it looked both backwards and forwards: backwards, to the sanctification bestowed upon it "Because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made" (<a href="../../par/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>); forwards, to the great sabbath in which Christ rested in the grave, and yet further onwards to another sabbath still to be enjoyed by the people of God. The sabbatical year and the jubilee were extensions of the sabbatical principle - certain civil and religious institutions and regulations being attached to each of them.

It commenced at sunset on Friday evening, and continued till sunset on Saturday evening. In later days the hour at which it began was announced by three blasts of the priests' trumpets, immediately after which a new course of priests entered on their ministry.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-5.htm">Leviticus 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">In the fourteenth <i>day</i> of the first month at even <i>is</i> the LORD'S passover.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's passover.</span> The month of Nisan was made the first month of the religious year in consequence of the original Passover having taken place in it (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-2.htm">Exodus 12:2</a>). On the occasion of the first, or Egyptian, Passover, all heads of a family, either singly or two or three heads of families in conjunction, provided themselves with a lamb or a kid on the 10th day of Nisan, killed it in the evening of the 14th, and, taking a bunch of hyssop, dipped it in the blood and struck the lintel and two side posts of the doors of their houses with the blood. They then roasted the animal whole for eating, added to it unleavened bread, and garnished it with bitter herbs. They made themselves ready to eat it by dressing themselves for a journey, "with their loins girded, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hands" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>), and thus they ate it in haste, in a standing position. The meaning of the ceremony is explained by what was taking place at the same time. On the same night, after the blood had been sprinkled upon the lintel and side posts, God slew the firstborn of all who had not exhibited this symbol of their having been brought into covenant with himself, and the Israelites set off hurriedly on their departure from Egypt. It was commanded that the day should be kept hereafter in like manner as a memorial, and that the following seven days should be kept as a Feast of Unleavened Bread (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14, 15</a>). This command is here concisely repeated, as it is again repeated in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1-8</a>. One very considerable change was, however, necessarily made in the method of its observance. Originally, each head of a household or combination of households sacrificed the lamb himself, and sprinkled the blood upon the doorposts and lintel. But after the establishment of the Aaronic priesthood and the withdrawal of the priestly authority previously vested in each head of a house (chapters 8, 9), and after the stringent prohibition of sacrificing elsewhere than in the court of the tabernacle had been issued (chapter 17), this could not continue. Accordingly, we find in the Book of Deuteronomy the direct injunction, "Thou mayest not sacrifice the Passover within any of thy gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee: but at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his Name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-5.htm">Deuteronomy 16:5, 6</a>). A result from this rule was that every male Israelite had to present himself at Jerusalem, and there slay his lamb on the day of the Passover, which in the time of Nero, brought between two and three million pilgrims to Jerusalem each year. The crowd of pilgrims took their way to the temple, and were admitted into the court in three divisions. There they slew each man his lamb, while the priests offered the blood on the altar, and the Levites sang the Hallel (<a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113-118</a>). Then they bore away the lambs, roasted them whole on a spit of pomegranate wood, taking care that no bone should be broken, and prepared the Paschal supper. At the supper, as well as at the sacrifice, a change of manner was introduced. "As the guests gathered round the Paschal table, they came no longer, as at the first celebration, with their loins girded, with shoes on their feet, and a staff in their hands; that is, as travelers waiting to take their departure. On the contrary, they were arrayed in their best festive garments, joyous and at rest, as became the children of a king. To express this idea, the rabbis also insisted that the Paschal supper, or at least part of it, must be eaten in that recumbent position with which we are familiar from the New Testament. 'For,' say they, 'they use this leaning posture, as free men do, in memorial of their freedom.' And again, 'Because it is the manner of slaves to eat standing, therefore now they eat sitting and leaning, in order to show that they have been delivered from bondage into freedom.' And finally, 'No, not the poorest in Israel may eat till he has sat down, leaning.' But though it was deemed desirable to sit leaning during the whole Paschal supper, it was only absolutely enjoined while partaking of the bread and the wine" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The essentials of the Paschal feast were the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-8.htm">Exodus 12:8</a>). To these were afterwards added a dish formed from an animal sacrificed on the Passover day, a composition of dates and other dried fruits, and four cups of red wine mixed with water, the last of which came to be regarded as essential as that which had been commanded in the Law. The Rabbi Gamaliel is reported by the Mishna to have said, "Whoever fails to explain three things in the Passover fails to fulfill his duty. These are the Paschal lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs. The Paschal lamb means that God passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt, which were sprinkled with blood; the unleavened bread, that our fathers were hurried out of Egypt; the bitter herbs, that the Egyptians made the lives of our fathers in Egypt bitter" (Pes. 10:15). The wine was regarded so necessary an adjunct, that it is ordered that every householder must provide himself with four cups, even if he had to sell or pawn his coat, or hire himself out for a servant, or receive money from the poor's box, in order to do so (Pes. 1). The supper began with drinking the first cup of wine, before which a grace, or thanksgiving, of the following character was said: - "Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, who hast created the fruit of the vine! Blessed art thou, Jehovah our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from among all people, and exalted us from among all languages, and sanctified us with thy commandments! And thou hast given us, in love, the solemn days for joy, and the festivals and appointed seasons for gladness, and this, the day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the season of our freedom, a holy convocation, the memorial of our departure from Egypt. For us hast thou chosen; and us hast thou sanctified from among all nations, and thy holy festivals with joy and with gladness hast thou caused us to inherit. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest Israel and the appointed seasons! Blessed art thou, Lord, King of the universe, who hast preserved us alive, and sustained us, and brought us to this season" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). After drinking the first cup, there followed a general washing of hands, after which the company ate some of the bitter herbs. Then the second cup was filled, and in order to carry out the injunction of <a href="../../par/exodus/12-26.htm">Exodus 12:26, 27</a>, the youngest member of the company inquired, "What mean ye by this service?" And the president of the feast replied, "It is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses." At the same time, he explained the purport of the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs, and called upon the company to give thanks for what God had wrought for them and for their fathers, ending with <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113, 114</a>, sung by all present. The second cup was then drunk, and after second washing of hands, the unleavened bread was broken, and thanks again given, after which the pieces of bread, the bitter herbs, the other sacrificial dish (if any), and the Paschal lamb were partaken of in turn. The third cup was then filled, thanks were again given, and the cup was drunk. This cup had the name of the "cup of blessing," owing to the blessing said over it, and it was succeeded after an interval by the fourth cup, when <a href="../../par/psalms/115.htm">Psalm 115-118</a> (which, with <a href="../../par/psalms/113.htm">Psalm 113, 114</a>, made up the Hallel) were sung, followed by a prayer of thanksgiving. <p> CHAPTER 23:6-44 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-6.htm">Leviticus 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">And on the fifteenth day of the same month <i>is</i> the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The Feast of Unleavened Bread was instituted at the same time with the Feast of the Passover (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15-17</a>), and from the beginning the two festivals were practically but one festival, never separated, though separable in idea. The Passover, strictly so called, lasted but one day, Nisan 14; the Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted seven days, Nisan 15-21. The whole made a festival of eight days, called indifferently the Feast of the Passover, or the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The bread to be eaten throughout the festival was unleavened, in order to remind the Israelites of the historical fact that on account of the urgency of the Egyptians, "the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>), and quitted the land of their affliction in haste. Accordingly, in the Book of Deuteronomy it is appointed, "Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou earnest forth out of the laud of Egypt all the days of thy life" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-3.htm">Deuteronomy 16:3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-7.htm">Leviticus 23:7</a></div><div class="verse">In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - The first and the last day were to be days of holy convocation, on which no servile work might be done. It was on the first day, Nisan 15, that our Lord was crucified. The Pharisees found nothing in the holiness of the day to prevent their taking virtual part in his seizure and condemnation and death; but we are told by St. John that "they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover" (<a href="../../par/john/18-28.htm">John 18:28</a>). What is meant in this passage by "the Passover" is not the Paschal lamb which had already been consumed, but probably the peace offering, or <span class="accented">chagigah</span>, which had to be offered and eaten on the first day of Unleavened Bread. The public sacrifices on each of the seven days of the week were two young bullocks, one ram, and seven Iambs for a burnt offering, with the accompanying meat offerings, and one goat for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-19.htm">Numbers 28:19-24</a>). And these were followed by peace offerings made at the discretion of individuals, "according to the blessing of the Lord which he had given them" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/16-17.htm">Deuteronomy 16:17</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - A second command is given on the subject of the Feast of Unleavened Bread respecting those ceremonies which were only to be made use of when the Israelites had reached Canaan. It has reference to the second day of Unleavened Bread, which is called <span class="cmt_word">the morrow after the sabbath</span>, the first day of the feast being meant by <span class="accented">the sabbath</span>, on whatever day of week it may have occurred. It was on this second day that the presentation of the first or wave sheaf of barley took place, according to the command, <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span> Which command was fulfilled in the following manner. "Already, on the 14th of Nisan, the spot whence the first sheaf was to be reaped bad been marked out by delegates from the Sanhedrim, by tying together in bundles, while still standing, the barley that was to be cut down. Though for obvious reasons it was customary to choose for the purpose the sheltered Ashes valley across Kedron, there was no restriction on that point, provided the barley had grown in an ordinary field - of course in Palestine itself - and not in garden or orchard land, and that the soil had not been manured nor yet artificially watered. When the time for cutting the sheaf had arrived, that is, on the evening of the 15th of Nisan (even though it was a sabbath)just as the sun went down, three men, each with a sickle and basket, formally set to work. But in order clearly to bring out all that was distinctive in the ceremony, they first asked of the bystanders three times each of these questions: 'Has the sun gone down?' 'With this sickle?' 'Into this basket?' ' On this sabbath?' (or first Passover day); and lastly, 'Shall I reap?' Having been each time answered in the affirmative, they cut down barley to the amount of one ephah, or ten omers, or three seahs, which is equal to about three pecks and three pints of our English measure. The ears were brought into the court of the temple" (Edersheim, 'Temple Service'). The sheaf composed of these ears (for the Authorized Version is right in considering that it is the sheaf, and not the omer of flour made out of the ears of barley, that is meant by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, though Josephus and the Mishna take it the other way) was on the following day waved by the priests before the Lord, in token of its consecration, and through it, of the consecration of the whole barley crop to the Lord. With it was offered the burnt offering of a lamb, a meat offering double the usual quantity, and a drink offering. This passage and verses 18 and 37, are the only places in the Book of Leviticus where the drink offering is mentioned. Until the waving of the sheaf, <span class="cmt_word">neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears</span>, that is, no grain in any form, might be eaten. We may imagine how delicacies made of the new flour would at once appear in the streets as soon as the sheaf had been waved.

It would have fallen about the beginning of June - a season of the year which would have made the journey to Jerusalem easy. The characteristic offering of the day was that of <span class="cmt_word">two wave loaves of two tenth deals... of fine flour...  baken with leaven.</span> These loaves were regarded as the firstfruits unto the Lord of the wheat harvest, although the greater part of the crop had now been reaped and housed. They were to be leavened and <span class="cmt_word">brought out of your habitations</span>; that is, they were to consist of such bread as was ordinarily used in daily life. They were made out of ears of wheat selected and cut like the barley in the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and then threshed and ground in the temple court. Each loaf contained an omer of flour, amounting to about five pints, and would therefore have weighed about five pounds. With these were offered two lambs, which were waved before the Lord by being led backwards and forwards before the tabernacle or the temple, and then the loaves were waved also, but they were not placed upon the altar, as they were leavened. The twentieth verse, which is somewhat obscure in the Authorized Version, should be punctuated as follows. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest shall wave them</span> (the two lambs) <span class="cmt_word">with the bread of the firstfruits</span> (the two loaves) for <span class="cmt_word">a wave offering before the Lord; with the two lambs they</span> (the loaves) <span class="cmt_word">shall be holy to the Lord for the priest.</span> The other sacrifices to be offered on this day are described in the text as <span class="cmt_word">seven lambs,...  one young bullock, and two rams... for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings,... </span> and <span class="cmt_word">one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</span> In the Book of Numbers (Numbers 28:27) they are stated to be "seven lambs," "two young bullocks," "one ram," with meat and drink offerings, and "one kid of the goats." Seeing that in Leviticus <span class="accented">one young bullock and two rams</span> are commanded, and in Numbers "two young bullocks and one ram," it is reasonable to suppose that a copyist's error has found its way into one or the other text. The feast was to be kept as a day of holy convocation, and no servile work was to be done upon it. The number of sacrifices offered by individuals who had come to Jerusalem caused the festivity to be in practice continued for several days subsequent to the festival itself.

The first day of the seventh month we should expect to be holier than the first day of any other month, on account of the peculiar holiness of the seventh month, and because it was the beginning of the civil year. It is to be a sabbath; that is, a festival observed by rest, and <span class="cmt_word">a memorial of blowing of trumpets</span>. The latter words should be rather rendered a <span class="accented">memorial of a joyful noise.</span> That these joyful sounds were made by blowing the cornet, we may well believe from the testimony of tradition, but the text of Holy Scripture does not state the fact, and the use of the word <span class="accented">trumpets</span> in place of "cornets" leads to a confusion. Every new moon, and among them that of the seventh month, was observed by the blowing of trumpets (<a href="../../par/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>), but the trumpets then blown differed in their use and shape from the cornet. The trumpet was a long-shaped, metal instrument, at first used to give the signal for marching, afterwards to serve as the sign of the arrival of the monthly festival; the cornet was an animal's horn, or, if not a real horn, an instrument formed in the shape of a horn, and it was used to express joyful emotions, answering somewhat to our modern bell-ringing in the West, or firing unloaded guns in the East. Besides the blowing of trumpets, special sacrifices were appointed for the first of each month, "two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings, for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). On New Year's Day, which, from its difference from the other new moons, was an annual as well as a monthly feast, the special offerings were "one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs," with their meat and drink offerings for a burnt offering, and "one kid of the goats" for a sin offering; and these were to be in addition to the offerings made on the first day of each month (<a href="../../par/numbers/29-2.htm">Numbers 29:2-6</a>). It became a custom for the Levites to chant at the morning sacrifice <a href="../../par/psalms/81.htm">Psalm 81</a>, and at the evening sacrifice <a href="../../par/psalms/29.htm">Psalm 29</a>. The great joyfulness of the day is shown by the account given of its observance in the Book of Nehemiah. It was on the first day of the seventh month that Ezra read the Book of the Law publicly to the people, and when "the people wept, when they heard the words of the Law," Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites said, "This day is holy unto the Lord your God; mourn not, nor weep....  Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is your strength.

The sin offering on each day was one kid of the goats. On the eighth day the burnt offering consisted of one bullock, one ram, seven lambs, and the sin offering, as before, of one kid of the goats. Thus there were offered in all, in the eight days, seventy-one bullocks, fifteen rams, one hundred and five lambs, and eight kids, beside meat and drink offerings.

The loaves were placed <span class="cmt_word">upon the pure table before the Lord</span>; that is, on the golden table of shewbread within the sanctuary - which stood not far from the vail which partitioned off the holy of holies - toward the north, as the candlestick was toward the south. The loaves were set, not, probably, <span class="cmt_word">in two rows, six on a row</span>, as they could have hardly stood in that position on so small a table as the table of shewbread (which was only three feet by one foot and a half), but <span class="accented">in piles, six in a pile.</span> Upon them, or more probably between the two piles, were placed two vials or cups filled with frankincense (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 3:07, 6). The shewbread was renewed every sabbath day, with much ceremony. "Four priests," says the Mishna, "enter, two of them carrying the piles of bread, and two of them the cups of incense. Four priests had gone in before them, two to take off the two old piles of shrewbread, and two to take off the cups of incense. Those who brought in the new stood at the north side facing southwards; those who took away the old, at the south side, facing northwards. One party lifted off and the other put on, the hands of one being over against the hands of the other, as it is written, Thou shalt set upon the table bread of the Passover always before me" ('Men.,' 11:7). The loaves that were removed were delivered to the priests for their consumption within the tabernacle, the whole quantity amounting to seventy-five pounds of bread per week. It was this bread which, in the pressure of necessity, Abimelech gave to David and his men (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4-6</a>). At the same time that the old loaves were changed, the frankincense was burned on the golden altar of incense for a memorial, even <span class="cmt_word">an offering made by fire unto the Lord.</span> There is nothing in Scripture to prove whether the loaves were leavened or unleavened. As being the meat offering of the tabernacle, we should expect them to be unleavened, like the meat offering of the court, but there was a reason why the meat offering of the court should be unleavened, which did not operate in the case of the shewbread. A part of the ordinary meat offering had to be burnt on the altar of burnt sacrifice; therefore it could not be leavened, because no leaven might be burned on the altar; but the shewbread was not burnt on any altar, and consequently it need not for that reason be unleavened. The two Pentecostal loaves, which were offered to the Lord by waving instead of burning, were leavened. The probabilities derived from Scripture appear to be equally strong on either side. Josephus states that they were unleavened ('Ant.,' 3:06, 6; 10, 7). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 24:10-23 The reason why the narrative of the blasphemer's death (verses 10-23) is introduced in its present connection, is simply that it took place at the point of time which followed the promulgation of the last law. It serves, however, to vindicate by a memorable example the principle which is at the foundation of every Mosaic law. "I am the Lord" is the often-repeated sanction, whether of a moral law or of a ceremonial regulation. But this bastard Israelite, one of the mixed multitude that had followed in the flight from Egypt (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>), blasphemed the Name of the Lord. If such blasphemy were to go unpunished, the obligation of law was dissolved. For, as Lange has said, "A community which suffers the reviling of the principle of their community without reaction, is morally fallen to pieces." He was brought, therefore, to Moses, and so solemn was the occasion, that Moses reserved the case, for which no provision had yet been made, for the special decision of God. The specific judgment on the man is that he shall die by stoning at the hands of the congregation, after the witnesses of his sin had laid their hands upon his head; and a general law is founded on the special case.

The word <span class="accented">nakav</span> is here rightly translated <span class="accented">blasphemeth</span> (cf. verses 14, 16, 23), but the words <span class="accented">of the Lord</span> should be omitted, as they are not found in the original, and are not required. The LXX. have rendered <span class="accented">nakav</span> by a word meaning <span class="accented">pronounced</span>, and on this misunderstanding, adopted by the Jews, has been founded the Jewish precept forbidding the utterance of the Divine Name. Owing to that prohibition, the true pronunciation of the word written and called "Jehovah" has been lost. Wherever the Name occurred in Scripture, that of <span class="accented">Adoring</span>, meaning <span class="accented">Lord</span>, was substituted for it in public reading, the consonants only of the original name, Y H V H, being preserved in the written text, and the vowels of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, namely a o a, being written underneath them in lieu of the original vowels. From the consonants Y H Y H and the vowels a o a would be formed Yahovah or Jahovah, but the laws of the Hebrew language required the first a to be changed into e, and hence the name Jehovah. It is almost certain that the original vowels were a and e, which would form the name Yahveh, the Samaritans having always so pronounced it, according to the testimony of Theodoret. It is said that the high priest continued to utter the very name Yahveh on the Day of Atonement long after it had ceased to be used in the reading of the Scriptures, and that when he did so, those who heard it prostrated themselves, saying, "Blessed be the Name!" After a time, however, he ceased to pronounce it aloud on that day also, lest it should be learnt and used for magical purposes. In consequence, perhaps, of the substitution of <span class="accented">Adonai</span> for <span class="accented">Yahveh</span>, the Septuagint version always reads for Yahveh, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: and the English version <span class="accented">the</span> LORD. In French and other versions the name is represented by <span class="accented">the Eternal</span>, and it has been proposed to substitute the latter rendering for <span class="accented">the</span> Loud in our own version. But it is more than doubtful whether we should then come nearer to the true sense of the original Yahveh, although at first sight it appears that this would be the case. For the word Yahveh is part of the causative form of the verb <span class="accented">havah</span>, or <span class="accented">hayah, to</span> be; but this verb is not used to express unchangeable or absolute existence, but rather an occurrence: its causative form, therefore, would signify that which brings about events; and the substantive derived from that causative form would signify, not one that eternally exists, but one that providentially governs. For an induction of instances for the further proof of the above meaning of the word Yahveh, we refer the reader to Sir William Martin's essay 'On the Divine Name' ('Semitic Languages,' part 2), from which we transcribe the concluding paragraph. "This view of the Divine Name, to which we are led by the evidence of the Hebrew language itself, is in full conformity with the general religious teaching of the Old Testament, which is practical and moral; setting forth in form readily intelligible, the character of God in his relations to man. It does not concern itself with those problems which philosophy has ever been seeking to solve. It addresses itself to human needs and human duties, and not to abstract inquiries. Not that the highest abstract truths were unknown or untaught. Lawgiver and prophet and psalmist set before the people the greatness and the eternity of God in language most clear and impressive. Yet the Name whereby he was put before them as the object of their daily worship, was not one which would exalt him to the utmost above the frail and changeful and transitory lives of his worshippers, and thereby remove him far away from them into the height of a Being beyond man's search or comprehension; but rather a Name which should bring him nigh to them, as One ever mindful of them, ever carrying forward his great purpose for their good, working for their deliverance in every time of need; as One 'whose providence ordereth all things in heaven and on earth.' If this Name did convey to the mind of a Hebrew hearer the thought above expressed, it follows that the old rendering <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or <span class="accented">Lord</span>, is to be preferred to that which has of late been substituted for it." <span class="cmt_word">And they brought</span> the blasphemer unto Moses. This was in accordance with the counsel of Jethro, accepted by Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>): "Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge:...  and they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves."

Its further signification was determined by the particular circumstances of the case.

Those who take the first view point out that the present offender was an Egyptian, and urge that had he cursed <span class="accented">his God</span>, that is, the Egyptian god or gods, he would only have had to bear his sin; but that as he had blasphemed the Name of Israel's God, Jehovah, he was to be stoned. The second explanation, however, is the truer one. The Scriptures recognize but one God, and he is the Lord Jehovah. Whoever curses him <span class="accented">shall bear his sin</span>, that is, shall be guilty in such a way that his sin must be purged either by punishment or by sacrifice, and it is then further declared that this particular sin can be purged only by the death of the offender at the hand of the congregation.

So it was by a judicial or semi-judicial proceeding that St. Stephen was stoned: "They brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law" (<a href="../../par/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12, 13</a>). And in spite of the violence exhibited, there was still some form of law, according to Jewish practice, observed in his stoning (<a href="../../par/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>). In the case of our Lord, on the other hand. when they regarded him as guilty of blasphemy on his saying, "Before Abraham was, I am" (<a href="../../par/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58</a>), and "I and my Father are one" (<a href="../../par/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>), the Jews "took up stones to cast at him," not waiting for a judicial condemnation, but, as they supposed, taking the law into their own hands. Had his death been by Jewish hands, it would at the last have been by stoning under this law. But the power of life and death had been taken away from the Jews by the Romans, "that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die" (<a href="../../par/john/18-32.htm">John 18:32</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../leviticus/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Leviticus 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Leviticus 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../leviticus/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Leviticus 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Leviticus 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/leviticus/25.htm"><title>Leviticus 25 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/leviticus/25.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/leviticus/25.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/leviticus/25-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../leviticus/24.htm" title="Leviticus 24">&#9668;</a> Leviticus 25 <a href="../leviticus/26.htm" title="Leviticus 26">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/25-1.htm">Leviticus 25:1</a></div><div class="verse">And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai.</span> The purpose of the words, <span class="accented">in Mount Sinai</span>, is not to distinguish the place in which the sabbatical law and the law of the jubilee were given from that in which the preceding laws were delivered.

Another excuse for the neglect may have been a difficulty which would have presented itself of fixing the date from which to count up to the seventh year, as different parts of the land were conquered at different times. According to the law, from New Year's Day of the seventh year (the 1st of Tisri, which occurred about the middle of September) to the following New Year's Day, there was to be neither sowing nor pruning, reaping or gathering. The expression, <span class="cmt_word">Neither shalt thou gather the grapes of thy vine undressed,</span> would be more literally rendered, <span class="accented">the grapes of thy Nazarite vine</span>, the vine with its unpruned tendrils, being likened to the Nazarite with his unshorn locks. As to sowing and reaping, an exception was made with respect to the barley sown and reaped for the Passover sheaf, and the wheat sown and reaped for the Pentecost loaves. The spontaneous fruits of the earth, and they were very large in the rich fields of the valleys and plains, were to be the property of all alike, whether the owners of the land or not, "that the poor of thy people might eat" (<a href="../../par/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>). And what was left by man was to be food for the cattle and beasts of the field. The cessation of agricultural labours must have served, and may have been intended to serve, as an encouragement to mercantile pursuits, as well as to the study of the Divine Law (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). The Feast of Tabernacles of the seventh year was specially appointed by Moses as a day for reading the Law to the assembled people (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/31-10.htm">Deuteronomy 31:10-13</a>). And the Mishna appoints the following passages of Deuteronomy to be read on that day: - <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1-6</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-8</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-23.htm">Deuteronomy 15:23</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-19</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/27.htm">Deuteronomy 27, 28</a>. ('Mish. Sotah.,' 7:8). The other ordinance connected with the sabbatical year, the release of debts to the poor (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-6</a>), was, like the fifth commandment, made of none effect by rabbinical traditions  - notably by one which required a debtor, when his creditor said, "I remit," to insist that nevertheless he should accept payment. The moral purpose of the sabbath of the seventh year is well drawn out by Keil: - "In the sabbatical year the land which the Lord had given his people was to observe a period of holy rest and refreshment to its Lord and God, just as the congregation did on the sabbath day; and the hand of man was to be withheld from the fields and fruit gardens from working them that they might yield their produce for his use. The earth was to be sacred from the hand of man, exhausting its power for earthly purposes as his own property, and to enjoy the holy rest with which God had blessed the earth and all its productions after the Creation. From this, Israel, as the nation of God, was to learn, on the one hand, that although the earth was created for man, it was not merely created for him to draw out its power for his own use, but also to be holy to the Lord and participate in the blessed rest; and on the other hand, that the great purpose for which the congregation of the Lord existed did not consist in the uninterrupted tilling of the earth, connected with bitter labour in the sweat of the brow (<a href="../../par/genesis/3-17.htm">Genesis 3:17, 19</a>), but in the peaceful enjoyment of the fruits of the earth, which the Lord their God had given them and would give them still, without the labour of their hands, if they strove to keep his covenant and satisfy themselves with his grace."

Palestine was God's land: he divided it once for all in the time of Joshua among his people, and every fifty years he required that recourse should be had to that original division, in order that in each generation the people might feel themselves to be his tenants, not independent owners, <span class="accented">possessores</span>, not <span class="accented">domini.</span>

If a man had to sell his land, he was bound to offer it to his nearest kinsman first (see <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-7.htm">Jeremiah 32:7, 8</a>).

Houses in cities, being occupied by artisans and built by human industry, not originally assigned in the territorial division, are not considered in so strict a sense the property of the Lord as the soil is, and may be parted with more readily. Yet the owners, if obliged to part with them, are allowed a year's grace, during which they are to have the right of buying them back. The expression, within <span class="cmt_word">a full year</span>, would be more literally rendered <span class="accented">during a fixed time</span>, that fixed time having just before been declared to be a year.

They constituted the share of the national property which was assigned to the tribe of Levi, and so far stood in the same relation to them as the land did to the other tribes. They therefore returned to the original possessor or his representative in the year of jubilee, and might at any earlier time be redeemed. The words, <span class="cmt_word">Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites,</span> should rather be rendered, <span class="accented">But in respect to the cities of the Levites.</span> There is a difficulty also as to the translation of the clause, <span class="cmt_word">And if a man purchase of the Levites,</span> for the word rendered <span class="accented">purchase</span> menus elsewhere <span class="accented">redeem</span>; but here the Authorized Version would seem to be correct. The sense that it gives is that if any one bought a house of the Levites, he had to render it back in the year of jubilee, just as though it had been land. On the other hand, the land belonging to the Levites, in the suburbs of the Levitical cities, which was used for the pasturage of the flocks of the Levites, could not be sold except to a Levite, and therefore no question between the Levites and members of the other tribes could arise regarding it. The phrase, <span class="cmt_word">the house that was sold, and the city of his possession,</span> must be understood, by a hendiadys, to mean, <span class="accented">the house that was sold in the city of his possession</span> (see Gesenius, 'Lex.,' s.v. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> i.b.).

It is presumed that no Hebrew will become a slave except on the pressure of poverty, and this poverty his brethren are commanded to relieve; but foreseeing that either want of charity on the part of the rich or unthrift on the part of the poor would certainly bring about slavery, the legislator makes regulations so as to soften its character as far as possible. The literal translation of verse 35 is as follows: <span class="cmt_word">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth by thee, thou shalt lay hold of him; a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee.</span> The translation of the latter clause adopted by the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner</span>; <span class="accented">that he may live with thee</span>, makes the duty of giving charitable support and loans of money to apply to the case of the stranger and sojourner as well as of the Israelite. The other and more probable rendering confines its application to native Israelites. <span class="accented">If thy brother becomes poor, and his hand faileth, thou shalt support him as a stranger or a sojourner</span>, that is, treat him with the forbearance shown to resident foreigners, to whose state he had reduced himself by the loss of his land. The command in verse 36, <span class="cmt_word">Take thou no usury of him, or increase,</span> does not bear upon the general question of taking interest for money when lent to wealthy men or companies for business purposes. It simply forbids the taking of interest or increase of a brother Israelite who had become poor. The history of Rome shows how much cruelty and revolution such an injunction may have prevented. The words, <span class="accented">or increase</span>, added to <span class="accented">usury</span>, forbid the exaction of any greater quantity of food or clothing (a method of evading the law against usury) than that which had been lent. The injunction was transgressed in the time of Nehemiah, when "he rebuked the nobles, and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother....  Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-7.htm">Nehemiah 5:7, 8</a>).

"Thy servant my husband is dead; (and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord:) and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>). And in the time of Nehemiah, "Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth....  And, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards" (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/5-3.htm">Nehemiah 5:3-5</a>). But the fact that an Israelite could not be kept in slavery for more than six years (<a href="../../par/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a>), and that the period of his service had to be still shorter if the jubilee fell before the seventh year, and the further fact that at the time of the jubilee he would not only he free, but recover any ancestral property that he had forfeited, so that he might become once more on an equality with his master, would have made his position totally different from the hopeless, helpless state of the Greek or Roman slave, even without the positive command that he was to be treated, not <span class="cmt_word">as a bondservant:</span> but <span class="cmt_word">as an hired servant,</span> and <span class="cmt_word">as a sojourner.</span> All alike, master and bondsman, were the slaves of God, and therefore not only were they, so far, on an equality one with another, but the master would be encroaching on the right of God if he claimed God's slaves for his own inalienably.

The latter had thought that, by the neglect of the sabbatical years, they had enriched themselves by the fruits of those years which would otherwise have been wasted. The result was that they lost the land altogether for a period equal to that during which it ought to have kept sabbath, and the land "as long as she lay desolate kept sabbath, to fulfill threescore and ten years" (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/36-21.htm">2 Chronicles 36:21</a>). From the entrance into the holy land until the Babylonish Captivity there elapsed eight hundred and sixty-three years, in which time there ought to have been kept one hundred and twenty-three sabbatical years. As only seventy are made up by the duration of the Captivity, it may be concluded that fifty-three sabbatical years were observed by the Israelites; but this conclusion is very doubtful. It is more likely that seventy, being a multiple of the sacred number seven, was regarded as sufficient to purge all previous neglects, whatever they might have been.

The final chapter, attached to the book after the concluding exhortation, is a short treatise on persons (verses 2-8), animals (verses 9-13), houses (verses 14, 15), lauds (verses 16-24), vowed to God; and on the commutation of vows. A man might vow to the service of God whatever he had a right over, that is, himself, his wife, his children, his slaves, his beasts, his houses, his fields. In case persons were vowed, the rule was that they should be redeemed at a certain price, though occasionally the redemption was not made. Vowing a person to God thus, was, as a rule, no more than vowing so much money to the use of the sanctuary as was fixed as the price of the redemption of the person vowed. Yet there is a great difference between the two acts of vowing a person and vowing the correlative sum of money. A man in great danger or distress might devote himself (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-20.htm">Genesis 28:20</a>) or another (<a href="../../par/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) to God, when he never would have vowed money. Such vows were redeemable, and, as a rule, were redeemed, though there were some exceptions, as in the case of Samuel. If beasts were vowed to the Lord (verses 9-13), they could not be redeemed if they were such as could be sacrificed to him; if they were not such as could be sacrificed, they were to be valued by the priest, and either retained as a possession of the sanctuary, or, if the owner preferred it, redeemed by him at the price fixed and out-fifth additional. If houses were vowed to the Lord (verses 14, 15), they became the property of the sanctuary, unless they were redeemed at the valuation set upon them by the priest, with one-fifth additional. If hereditary lands were vowed to the Lord (verses 16-21), they became the possession of the sanctuary at the year of jubilee, unless they had been previously redeemed; redemption, however, was in this case the ordinary rule, and we do not hear of any accumulation of landed property in the hands of the priests from this source. In the case of a field which was not an hereditary possession, but a purchase, being vowed to the Lord (verses 22-24), the commutation sum was paid down "in that day," that is, on the spot in a lump sum, the land going back at the jubilee to the original owners from whom the temporary possession had been bought by the man who made the vow. A section is added forbidding the firstborn of animals, things devoted, and tithes to be vowed, because they were already the Lord's; allowing the redemption of the firstborn of unclean animals, and of the tithes of corn and fruits, but prohibiting redemption in the case of sacrificial animals, of things devoted, and of the tithes of animals.

"To this it may be added that the devotion by ban (<span class="accented">cherem</span>) of any object or person was not to be done by private persons, at their own will, but was performed by the civil magistrates, under known conditions and laws; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the cities of idolaters, such as Jericho, were so devoted, and the inhabitants, by the command of God himself, who made his people to be the executioners of his judgments against inveterate idolatry (see <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/6-17.htm">Joshua 6:17</a>)" (Wordsworth).

Jacob vowed the tenth to the Lord (<a href="../../par/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>), whence we see that the practice of the payment of tithes was not of Mosaic institution, but immemorial. The duty was, however, commanded afresh for the Israelites. "I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle" (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>), and of this tithe they were to pay a tenth to the priests (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>). Being already the Lord's, the tithe of the corn and fruits could not be vowed to the Lord, but it could be redeemed, or commuted, by the owner paying one-fifth more than the price at which it was valued.

The word used in the original for "meat offering" (<span class="accented">minchah</span>), means, like its Greek equivalent, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a gift made by an inferior to a superior. Thus the sacrifices of Cain and Abel were their "minchah" to God (<a href="../../par/genesis/4-3.htm">Genesis 4:3, 4</a>), the present sent to Esau by Jacob was his "minchah" (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>), and the present to Joseph was his brethren's "minchah" (<a href="../../par/genesis/43-11.htm">Genesis 43:11</a>). It is therefore equivalent to a gift of homage, which recognizes the superiority of him to whom it is offered, and ceremonially promises loyal obedience to him. Owing to its use in this passage, it came gradually to be confined in its signification to vegetable gifts, - unbloody sacrifices, as they are called sometimes, in contrast to animal sacrifices - while the word "corban" crone to be used in the wider acceptation which once belonged to "minchah." The conditions to be fulfilled by the Israelite who offered a meat offering were the following. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> He must offer either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> uncooked flour, with oil, salt, and frankincense, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> flour made into an unleavened cake (whether of the nature of biscuit or pancake), with oil, salt, and frankincense; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> roasted grains, with oil, salt, and frankincense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He must bring his offering to the court of the tabernacle, and give to the priests at least as much as one omer (that is, nearly a gallon), and not more than sixty-one omers. The priest receiving it from him must: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> Take a handful of the flour, oil, and salt, or a proportionate part of the cake (each omer generally made ten cakes) in place of the flour, and burn it with all the frankincense as a <span class="accented">memorial</span> upon the altar of burnt offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> With his brother priests he must eat the remainder within the precincts of the tabernacle. Here the essentials of the sacrifice are the presentation made by the offerer, and the burning of <span class="accented">the memorial</span> on the altar, followed by the consumption of the remainder by the priests. The moral lesson taught to the Israelite completed that of the burnt offering. As the burnt offering taught self-surrender, so the meat offering taught recognition of God's supremacy and submission to it, the first by the surrender of a living creature substituted for the offerer, the second by the gift of a part of the good things bestowed by God on man for the preservation of life which, being given back to God, serve as a recognition of his supremacy. Spiritually the lesson taught the Jew was that of the necessity of a loyal service to God; and mystically he may have learnt a lesson <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as to the force of prayer rising up to heaven as the incense which had to be offered with each form of the meat offering; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as to the need of purity and incorruption, symbolized by the prohibition of leaven and honey, and the command to use salt. The supplemental character of the meat offering accounts for the order in which it here stands, not arbitrarily interposed between two animal sacrifices, but naturally following on the burnt offering, as an adjunct to it and the complement of its teaching. So close was the union between the two sacrifices, that the burnt offering was never offered without the accompaniment of the meat offering (<a href="../../par/numbers/15-4.htm">Numbers 15:4</a>). It has been also maintained that the meat offering, like the drink offering, was never made independently of the animal sacrifice; but this cannot be proved. On the contrary, the manner in which laws regulating it are here laid down, lead to the inference that it might be offered, when any willed it, by itself. The close connection between the sacrifice of an animal and the offering of cakes of flour, and of wine, is noticeable in heathen sacrifices likewise. The very word, <span class="accented">immolare</span>, translated "to sacrifice," is derived from the <span class="accented">mola</span> or salt-cake offered with the animal; and the other word ordinarily used in Latin for "sacrifice," that is, <span class="accented">mactare</span>, is derived from the victim being enriched (<span class="accented">magis auctus</span>) with the libation of wine. Thus we see that the offering of the fruits of the earth was regarded, elsewhere as well as in Judaea, as the natural concomitant of an animal sacrifice, and not only that, but as so essential a part of the latter as to have given a name to the whole ceremony, and not only to the whole ceremony, but to the specific act of the slaughter of the victim. The thought of the heathen in offering the fruits of the earth was probably not much different from that of the Israelites. It was his gift to the superhuman power, to which he thus acknowledged that he owed submission. We may further notice that salt was enjoined in the heathen as in the Jewish sacrifices as indispensable. Pliny says that the importance of salt is seen especially in sacrifices, none of which are completed without the salt-cake ('Hist. Nat.,' 31, 7) The now obsolete use of the word "meat" in the sense of "food," in contrast to "flesh," creates some confusion of thought. "Fruit offering" would be a better title, were it not that the signification of "fruit" is going through a similar change to that which "meat" has undergone. "Flour offering" might be used, but an alteration in the rendering is not imperative.

This was the task of the priest. The handful that he took and burnt upon the altar has the technical and significative name of the memorial. It acted as a memorial before God, in the same way as Cornelius's prayers and alms - "Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God" (<a href="../../par/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>) - being something which should cause God to think graciously of the offerer. The frankincense is not mixed with the flour and the oil and the salt, as a constituent element of the offering, but is placed upon them, and is all of it burnt in "the memorial," symbolizing the need of adding prayer to sacrifice, that the latter may be acceptable to God.

The meat offerings must have gone far to supply the priests with farinaceous food, as, for every handful of flour burnt on the altar, nearly a gallon went to the priests. They had to eat it within the precincts of the tabernacle, as was the case with all meats that were <span class="accented">most holy</span>, viz. the minchahs, the shew-bread, and the flesh of the sin offering and of the trespass offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-12.htm">Leviticus 10:12</a>). Other meats assigned to the priests might be eaten in any clean place (<a href="../../par/leviticus/10-14.htm">Leviticus 10:14</a>). The priests' own meat offerings were wholly burnt (<a href="../../par/leviticus/6-23.htm">Leviticus 6:23</a>).

The prohibition only extends to their being burnt on the altar, owing, no doubt, to the effect of fire upon them in making them swell and froth, thus creating a repulsive appearance which, as we shall see, throughout the Mosaic legislation, represents moral evil. The firstfruits of honey are to be offered (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>), and leaven is to be used in the two wave loaves offered at the Feast of Pentecost as firstfruits (<a href="../../par/leviticus/23-17.htm">Leviticus 23:17</a>). the words translated, As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the Lord, should be rendered, <span class="accented">As an oblation of firstfruits ye shall offer them</span> (that <span class="accented">is</span>, leaven and honey), <span class="accented">but they shall not be burnt on the altar.</span> The mark in A.V. denoting a new paragraph at the beginning of verse 12, should be removed.

It is an emblem of an established and enduring covenant, such as God's covenant with his people, which is never to wax old and be destroyed, and it is therefore termed the salt of the covenant of thy God. Hence "a covenant of salt" came to mean a covenant that should not be broken (<a href="../../par/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/13-5.htm">2 Chronicles 13:5</a>). The use of salt is not confined to the meat offering. With all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.

The lesson taught by the peace off, ring was the blessedness of being in union with God as his covenant people, and the duty and happiness of exhibiting a joyous sense of this relation by celebrating a festival meal, eaten reverently and thankfully in the house of God, a part of which was given to God's priests, and a part consumed symbolically by God himself. The burnt offering had typified self-surrender; the meat offering, loyal submission; the peace offering typified the joyous cheerfulness of those who, having in a spirit of perfect loyalty surrendered themselves to God, had become his children, and were fed at the very board at which he deigned symbolically to partake. The most essential part of the meat offering was the presentation; of the burnt offering, the consumption of the victim on the altar; of the peace offering the festive meal upon the sacrifice. The combined burnt and meat offering was the sacrifice of one giving himself up to God; the peace offering, that of one who, having given himself up to God, is realizing his communion with him. In this respect the peace offering of the old dispensation foreshadows the Lord's Supper in the new dispensation. Several other names have been proposed for the peace offering, such as thank offering, salvation offering, etc. No name is more suitable than peace offering, but the word must be understood not in the sense of an offering to bring shout peace, but an offering of those who arc in a state of peace, answering to the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span>, rather than to the Latin word <span class="accented">pacifica.

At the time of the Mosaic legislation, burnt offerings and meat offerings were already in existence, and had existed from the time of the Fall. A beginning, therefore, is made with them, and the regulations of the peace offerings naturally follow, because these sacrifices succeed in order to the burnt and meat offerings, and because sacrifices in some respects of the same nature as peace offerings had previously existed under a different name (cf. <a href="../../par/exodus/10-25.htm">Exodus 10:25</a> with <a href="../../par/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and see above notes on chapter 3). The sin and trespass offerings, therefore, are left to the last, though, owing to their meaning, they were always offered first of all, when sacrifices of all three kinds were made together. They are the means of ceremonially propitiating God when alienated from his people, or from any individual member of it, by sin, which they legally atone for. The need of expiation is implied and suggested by the offering of the blood, both in the burnt sacrifice and the peace offering (cf. <a href="../../par/job/1-5.htm">Job 1:5</a>). But this was not sufficient; there must be a special sacrifice to teach this great truth as its primary lesson. The sin offering typifies the sacrifice of our Lord JESUS CHRIST upon the cross, as the great Sin Offering for mankind, whereby the wrath of God was propitiated, and an expiation for the sins of man was wrought, bringing about reconciliation between God and man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD <i>concerning things</i> which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If a soul shall sin.</span> The conditions to be fulfilled in presenting a sin offering differed according to the position held by the offerer in the state.

If it were the congregation that made the offering, the same conditions had to be fulfilled, except that the elders of the congregation had to lay their hands on the animal. If it were a ruler, the animal offered was to be a male kid, and the priest, instead of taking the blood into the sanctuary, was to smear it on the horns of the altar of burnt sacrifice in the court. If it were an ordinary member of the congregation, the animal was to be a female kid, or ewe lamb, which was to be dealt with in the same manner; or in some cases two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering (whose blood was all sprinkled round the inner side of the altar), the other for a burnt offering (which was to be treated according to the ritual of the burnt offering), or even the tenth part of an ephah of flour (without oil or frankincense), a handful of which was to be burnt, and the remainder delivered to the priest for his consumption. The moral lesson taught to the Jew by the sin offering was of the terrible nature of sin, and of the necessity for an expiation for it in addition to penitence. Mystically he might see that, as the blood of bulls and goats could not of its own virtue take away sin, there must be an offering, foreshadowed by the sacrifice of the animals, which should be effectual as these were symbolical The type is fulfilled by the atonement wrought by Christ's blood shed on the cross (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-21</a>). Further, the ceremonial cleansing of the sinful Israelite by the sin offering in the old dispensation foreshadows the effect of baptism in the new dispensation, for, as Calvin has noted in his Commentary, "As sins are now sacramentally washed away by baptism, so under the Law also sacrifices were expiations, although in a different way." <span class="cmt_word">If a soul shall sin through ignorance.</span> The expression, "through ignorance" (<span class="accented">bishgagah</span>), is intended to cover all sins except those committed "with a high hand," or defiantly, whether the agent was ignorant that they were sins or was led into them by inconsiderateness or infirmity (cf. <a href="../../par/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12, 13</a>, "Who can understand his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins"). A better translation of <span class="accented">bishgagah</span> would be <span class="accented">by want of consideration</span>, or <span class="accented">by inadvertence.</span> Our Lord could say, even of those who crucified him, "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do;" and therefore even for them a sin offering might be made and be accepted. But for deliberate and determined sin the Law has no atonement, no remedy. The words, <span class="cmt_word">shall do against any of them</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, against the commandments, would be better rendered <span class="accented">shall do any of them</span>, i.e., the things <span class="cmt_word">which ought not to be done.</span> There is no exact apodosis to this verse; it is a general heading to the chapter.

He is designated the <span class="cmt_word">priest that is anointed</span>, in respect to which title, see notes on chapter 8. In case he sins in his representative character, his sin is such as <span class="accented">to bring guilt on the people</span> (this is the meaning of the words translated <span class="cmt_word">according to the sin of the people</span>), and a special sin offering must therefore be made. He is to <span class="cmt_word">take of the blood</span> of the animal sacrificed, and <span class="cmt_word">bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:...  and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the vail of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense.</span> This was a more solemn method of presenting the blood to the Lord than that used in the burnt offering; the offering of the blood, which was the vehicle of life, being the chief feature in the sin offering, as the consumption of the whole animal by the altar fire was in the burnt offering. In the burnt offerings and peace offerings the blood was thrown once on the altar of burnt sacrifice (see chapter Leviticus 1:5); now it is sprinkled, in a smaller quantity each <span class="accented">time</span>, but as often as seven times (the number seven symbolically representing completeness), before the vail which shrouded the ark. <span class="accented">The altar of sweet incense</span> is the golden altar, which stood within the tabernacle, in front of the vail. Perhaps the reason why <span class="accented">the horns of the altar</span> are specially appointed to have the blood placed on them is that they were regarded as the most sacred part of the altar, because they were its highest points, in which its elevation towards heaven culminated. The remainder of the victim's blood is to be poured <span class="cmt_word">at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering</span>, in the court of the tabernacle, to sink into the ground, because no more of it was wanted for ceremonial use. The internal fat is to be burnt upon the altar of the burnt offering, but not actually upon the smoldering burnt sacrifice, as in the case of the peace offerings; the sin offering preceding the burnt offering in order of time, while the peace offering followed it. The remainder of the animal <span class="cmt_word">is to be carried without the camp...  and be burnt</span>, because its flesh was at once accursed and most holy. It was accursed, as having been symbolically the vehicle of the sins laid upon it by the offerer; therefore it must not be consumed upon the altar of God, but be destroyed with fire outside the camp, typifying the removal from God's kingdom, and the final destruction of all that is sinful. But yet it was most holy, as its blood had been taken into the tabernacle, and had served as a propitiation; therefore, if it had to be burnt, it yet had to be burnt solemnly, reverently, and as a ceremonial act, in a place appointed for the purpose. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews notices that one of the points in which our Lord was the antitype of the sin offering was that he "suffered without the gate," "that he might sanctify the people with his own blood" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>), which was thus indicated to have been carried within the sanctuary, that is, into heaven.

This injunction is a direct condemnation of the approved teaching of Italian moral theologians of paramount authority throughout the Roman Church, who maintain that, in case a crime is not known to others, a witness in a court of justice "may, nay, he is bound to, say that the accused has not committed it" (St. Alfonso de' Liguori, 'Theol.

Confession of sin probably preceded or accompanied all sin offerings. The use of the word <span class="accented">asham</span>, translated <span class="cmt_word">trespass offering</span> in verse 6, and the character of the four cases have led many commentators to regard verses 1-13 as dealing with the trespass offering rather than the sin offering. But if this were so, the words <span class="accented">trespass offering</span> and <span class="accented">sin offering</span> would be used synonymously in this verse, which is very unlikely, when they are immediately afterwards carefully distinguished. It is best to render <span class="accented">asham</span> "for his trespass," that is, in expiation of his guilt, as in the next verse, in place of a <span class="accented">trespass offering.</span>

There is thus typically set forth the freedom with which acceptance through the great propitiation is offered to all without respect of persons. The non-bloody substitute, being permitted only as an exception for the benefit of the very poor and only in the four cases above specified, does not invalidate the general rule that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 5:14-19

The non-payment of tithes and offerings was looked upon as robbing Jehovah (<a href="../../par/malachi/3-8.htm">Malachi 3:8</a>), and therefore it is that a trespass offering, involving compensation, and not only a sin offering, is required to atone for the offense. The ram that is to be offered is to be of a value fixed by the priest (<span class="cmt_word">with thy estimation</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the estimation of the priest), and the priest is to estimate it <span class="cmt_word">by shekels of silver</span>; implying that its value must amount at least to <span class="accented">shekels</span> (in the plural), meaning two shekels (see <a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where "portions" means "more than one portion," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "two portions").

The fat of the peace offerings, that is, the parts of the peace offerings that were burnt on the altar, were laid on the burnt offering. The altar fire was never to go out, because the daily sacrifices constantly burning on the altar symbolized the unceasing worship of God by Israel, and the gracious acceptance of Israel by God. The ever-burning sacrifice was the token of the people being in communion with God.

There are three sorts of peace offerings - thank offerings (verses 12-15), votive offerings, and voluntary offerings (verses 16-18). Of these, the thank offerings were made in thankful memorial for past mercies; votive offerings were made in fulfillment of a vow previously taken, that such offering should be presented if a terrain condition were fulfilled. Voluntary offerings differ from votive offerings by not having been previously vowed, and from thank offerings by not having reference to any special mercy received. The thank offering must be eaten by the offerer and his friends, on the same day that it was offered; the votive and the voluntary offerings, which were inferior to the thank offering in sanctity, on the same day or the next. The reason why a longer time was not given probably was that the more the meal was delayed, the less would a religious character be attached to it. The necessity of a quick consumption also took away the temptation of acting grudgingly towards those with whom the feast might be shared, and it likewise precluded the danger of the flesh becoming corrupted. If any of the flesh remained till the third day, it was to be <span class="cmt_word">burnt with fire</span>; if eaten on that day, it should not be <span class="cmt_word">accepted or imputed unto him that offered</span>, that is, it should not be regarded as a sacrifice of sweet savour to God, but an abomination (literally, <span class="accented">a stench</span>), and whoever ate it should <span class="cmt_word">bear his iniquity</span>, that is, should be guilty of an offense, requiring, probably, a sin offering to atone for it. The bread gift accompanying the animal sacrifice was to consist of three kinds of unleavened cakes, and one cake of leavened bread, and <span class="cmt_word">one out of the whole oblation</span>, that is, one cake of each kind, was to be offered by heaving and then given to the officiating priest, the remaining cakes forming a part of the offerer's festive meal. If any one took part of a feast on a peace offering while in a state of Levitical uncleanness, he was to be <span class="cmt_word">cut off from his people</span>, that is, excommunicated, without permission to recover immediate communion by offering a sin offering. St. Paul joined in a votive offering (<a href="../../par/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>).

The equal dignity of the peace offerings with the other offerings is vindicated by the command that the offerer <span class="cmt_word">shall bring it</span> with <span class="cmt_word">his own hands</span>, whereas it might have been regarded as merely the constituent part of a feast, and so sent by the hand of a servant. <span class="cmt_word">The breast</span> and <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span> were to be waved and heaved (for "heaved" does not merely mean" taken off," as some have said). The waving consisted of the priest placing his hands beneath those of the offerer who held the piece to be waved, and moving them slowly backwards and forwards before the Lord, to and from the altar; the heaving was performed by slowly lifting the pieces heaved upwards and downwards. The movements were made to show that the pieces, though not burnt on the altar, were yet in a special manner consecrated to God's service. <span class="accented">The right shoulder</span> was most probably the hind leg, perhaps the haunch. The Hebrew word is generally translated "leg" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-35.htm">Deuteronomy 28:35</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/147-10.htm">Psalm 147:10</a>). This part was the perquisite of the officiating priest; the waved breast was given to the priests' common stock.

In these verses we see the order in which they were <span class="cmt_word">put on</span>. After the priests had, no doubt, changed their linen drawers, there came, first, <span class="cmt_word">the coat</span>, that is, a close-fitting tunic of white linen, made with sleeves and covering the whole body; <span class="cmt_word">next the girdle</span> of the tunic, that is, a linen sash for tying the tunic round the body, with variegated ends hanging on each side to the ankles; thirdly, <span class="cmt_word">the robe</span>, that is, a blue vesture, woven of one piece, with holes for the head and arms to pass through, reaching from the neck to below the knee, the bottom being ornamented with blue, purple, and scarlet pomegranates, alternating with golden bells; fourthly, <span class="cmt_word">the ephod</span>, which consisted of two shoulder-pieces, or epaulettes, made of variegated linen and gold thread, fastened together in front and at the back by a narrow strap or band, from which hung, before and behind the wearer, two pieces of cloth confined below by <span class="cmt_word">the curious girdle of the ephod</span>, that is, by a sash made of the same material as the ephod itself. Into the ephod were sewn two onyxes, one on each shoulder, in gold filigree settings, one of them engraven with the names of half of the tribes, and the other with the remaining half; and from two rosettes or buttons by the side of these stones depended twisted gold chains for the support of the breastplate. Fifth came <span class="cmt_word">the breastplate</span>, which was a square pocket, made of embroidered linen, a span long and a span broad, worn upon the breast and hanging from the gold chains above mentioned, the lower ends of the gold chain being tied to two rings at the upper and outer corner of the breastplate, while the upper and inner corner of the same was attached to the ephod by blue thread running through two sets of rings in the breastplate and ephod respectively. The outer side of the breastplate was stiffened and adorned by twelve precious stones, set in four rows of three, each stone having on it the name of one of the tribes of Israel. The breastplate being double and the two sides and the bottom being sewn up, the pocket formed by it had its opening at the top. Into this pocket were placed <span class="cmt_word">the Urim and the Thummim</span>, which were probably two balls of different colours, one of which on being drawn out indicated the approval of God, and the other his disapproval, as to any point on which the high priest consulted him. (The Jewish tradition, that the Divine answer by the Urim and the Thummim came by a supernatural light thrown on certain letters in the names of the tribes, has no foundation.) The last part of the dress to be put on was <span class="cmt_word">the mitre</span>, or head-dress of linen, probably of the nature of a turban; to which, by a blue string, was attached <span class="cmt_word">the golden plate</span>, in such a way that it rested lengthwise on the forehead, and on this plate or <span class="cmt_word">holy crown</span> were inscribed the words," Holiness to the Lord." The investiture took place <span class="cmt_word">as the Lord commanded Moses</span>, that is, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="../../par/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. Its purpose and its meaning in the eyes of the people would have been twofold: first, after the manner of the king's crown and the judge's robe, it served to manifest the fact that the function of priest was committed to the wearer; and next, it symbolized the necessity of being clothed upon with the righteousness of God, in order to be able to act as interpreter and mediator between God and man, thus foreshadowing the Divine Nature of him who should be the Mediator in antitype.

(For <span class="cmt_word">the anointing oil</span>, which is here referred to as a thing well known, see <a href="../../par/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-25</a>, where its component parts are designated.) The consecration of things as well as of persons is sanctioned by the action of Moses, who <span class="cmt_word">anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them</span>. They were thus set apart for holy purposes. By <span class="accented">all that was therein</span> would be meant the ark, the vail, the altar of incense, the candlesticks, the table of show-bread. After the tabernacle and its furniture had been anointed, the altar - that is, the brazen altar - <span class="cmt_word">and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot</span>, were sprinkled; not once only, as the things within the tabernacle, but <span class="cmt_word">seven times</span>, to show that it was specially holy, although situated only in the court. <span class="accented">The laver</span>, for the priests' use, was between the door of the tabernacle and the brazen altar of burnt offering. Its <span class="accented">foot</span>, or base, is described in <a href="../../par/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>, as made, according to the translation of the Authorized Version, "of brass, of the looking-glasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door of the tabernacle."

The change of the verb <span class="accented">poured</span> for <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, indicates that the amount of "the precious ointment" poured "upon the head, that ran down unto the beard, and went down to the skirts of his garments" (<a href="../../par/psalms/133-2.htm">Psalm 133:2</a>), was far greater than that with which the furniture of the tabernacle had been anointed. The oil sprinkled on the holy things sanctified them as means of grace. The oil poured upon Aaron represents the grace of the Holy Spirit, coming from without, but diffusing itself over and throughout the whole consecrated man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/8-13.htm">Leviticus 8:13</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - The investiture of <span class="cmt_word">Aaron's sons</span>  - Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar - follows the consecration of their father.

But there is no statement here of their being anointed, although their anointing is ordered in <a href="../../par/exodus/28-41.htm">Exodus 28:41</a>, and still more imperatively in <a href="../../par/exodus/40-15.htm">Exodus 40:15</a>.

On the other hand, the high priest is specially designated as "the priest that is anointed" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>). It is probable that the personal anointing of the ordinary priests was confined to their being sprinkled with oil, as described below in verse 30; but that they were regarded as virtually anointed in Aaron's anointing. The Levites had no special dress until they obtained permission from Herod Agrippa I[. to wear the priestly robes (Joseph., 'Ant.,' 20:09, 6).

There had been burnt offerings and sacrifices akin to peace offerings before, but no sin offerings. At once the sin offering takes its place as the first of the three sacrifices before the burnt offerings and peace offerings.

The victim offered by and for Aaron and his sons is a bullock, the same animal that is appointed for the offering of the high priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/4-3.htm">Leviticus 4:3</a>).

The reason of this is that Aaron was not yet high priest, and also that the offering was made not only for Aaron, but also for his sons; and further, the blood as well as the anointing oil was required to <span class="cmt_word">purify the altar, and sanctify it</span> (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>).

This portion consisted of the internal fat and tail, which was usually burnt (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>), and the heave offering of <span class="cmt_word">the right shoulder</span>, or hind leg, which generally went to the officiating priest (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), and one of each of the unleavened cakes. After this special ceremony of waving, peculiar to the rite of consecration, the usual wave offering (the breast) was waved by Moses and consumed by himself. Ordinarily it was for the priests in general (<a href="../../par/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31</a>).

Aaron is said to have <span class="cmt_word">offered the burnt offering according to the manner</span>, or, as it is given in the margin, <span class="accented">ordinance</span>, that is, he burnt the flesh on the altar (<a href="../../par/leviticus/1-7.htm">Leviticus 1:7-9</a>); he also <span class="cmt_word">burnt</span> the <span class="cmt_word">handful</span> of the meat offering, and he <span class="cmt_word">burnt the fat</span> of the peace offering, <span class="cmt_word">upon the altar</span>. He had previously burnt the fat of his own sin offering, and the flesh of his burnt offering. Fire, therefore, was present upon the altar, and was used by Aaron, as by Moses, for sacrificial purposes <span class="accented">before</span> the fire came out from the Lord as described in verse 24.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/9-23.htm">Leviticus 9:23</a></div><div class="verse">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moses</span> (for the last time) and <span class="cmt_word">Aaron</span> (for the first time) went into the tabernacle in the character of priest. During this visit Moses committed to Aaron the care of the things within the tabernacle, as he had already given him the charge of all connected with the sacrifices of the court. Not till after this is Aaron fully initiated into his office. "No man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>). On coming out from the tabernacle, Moses and Aaron, standing near the door, unite in blessing the congregation, in order to show the harmony between them and the capacity of blessing in the Name of the Lord enjoyed by Aaron as by Moses. The latter has now divested himself of that part of his office which made him the one mediator between God and his people, Aaron is henceforth a type of Christ as well as Moses. While giving the joint blessing, the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the people, proceeding from the ark, and enveloping the lawgiver and the priest as they stood together. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a></div><div class="verse">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: <i>which</i> when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a fire out from before the Lord.</span> The sacrifices were already smouldering on the altar, a ram, a calf, and a lamb, besides the internal fat of a young bull, a kid, a bullock, and a ram, and a handful of flour. They would have continued smouldering all the day and the night, but a miraculous fire issued from the tabernacle, and consumed the whole in the sight of the people. So fire fell and consumed Solomon's sacrifice at the dedication of the temple. Jewish tradition reports that the fire was always kept alive until the reign of Manasseh, when it became extinguished. <span class="cmt_word">When the people saw</span> this sight, <span class="cmt_word">they shouted</span>, and <span class="cmt_word">fell on their faces</span>. They had been standing in a state of intense expectation, awaiting the fulfillment of the promise that the Lord would appear unto them today, and watching the acts of the two brothers; and their feelings are now raised to the utmost enthusiasm and awe by the appearance of the glory of the Lord and the notion of the Divine fire.
