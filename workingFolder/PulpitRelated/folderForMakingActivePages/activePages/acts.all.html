A glance at the map will show that Caesarea (see note to <a href="../../par/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>) was but a short distance, some thirty miles, from Joppa. It was doubtless with a view to Peter's momentous errand to Caesarea that Luke recorded his previous visit to Lydda and his residence at Joppa, consequent upon the restoring of Dorcas to life: the <span class="accented">origines</span> of Gentile Christianity being the prime object of the Acts (see Introduction to the Acts). <span class="cmt_word">The Italian band</span>; or, <span class="accented">cohort</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). The <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, or cohort, was used in two <span class="accented">senses.</span> When spoken of strictly Roman troops, it meant the tenth part of a legion, and consisted of from four hundred and twenty-five to five hundred or six hundred men, according to the strength of the legion. Its commander was called a chiliarch, and it was divided into centuries, each commanded by a centurion. But when spoken of auxiliary provincial troops, it meant a regiment of about a thousand men (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 3:42). It is in this last sense probably that it is used here. Josephus, in the passage above quoted, speaks of five such auxiliary cohorts coming from Caesarea to join Vespasian's army, and he tells us in another place ('Bell. Jud.,' 2:18, 7) that the principal portion of the Roman army at Caesarea were Syrians. It is pretty certain, therefore, that the Italian cohort here spoken of were auxiliaries, so called as being made up in whole or in part of Italians, probably volunteers or <span class="accented">velones</span> (Farrar, vol. 1:278, note). Another reason for this conclusion is that it does not seem likely that one of the <span class="accented">divisions</span> of a legion should have a name (though it was very common for the legions themselves to be distinguished, in addition to their number, prima, secunda, decima, etc., by such names as Italics, Parthica, Augusta, etc.), but that separate regiments would naturally have appropriate names for the same reason that the legions had. Thus, besides the Italian cohort here named, we have the Augustan cohort in <a href="../../par/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>. It might be important for the security of the procurator, in so turbulent a province as Judaea, to have at least one cohort of Italian soldiers at the seat of government. Renan ('Apotres,' p. 202) thinks the full name of the cohort may have been "Cohors prima Augusta Italica civium Romanorum;" and adds that there were in the whole empire not fewer than thirty-two cohorts bearing the name of <span class="accented">Italian.</span>

It is an interesting question as to what was the precise religions status of Cornelius, whether he was a proselyte in any technical sense. But the whole narrative, in which he is spoken of simply as a Gentile and uncircumcised, seems to indicate that, though he had learnt from the Jews to worship the true God, and from the Jewish Scriptures read or heard in the synagogue to practice those virtues which went up for a memorial before God, yet he was in no sense a proselyte. It is pleasant to think that there may have been many such in the different countries where the Jews were dispersed (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/13-16.htm">Acts 13:16</a>, and probably <a href="../../par/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a>).

It was, as Meyer says, a clear angelic appearance; there was no indistinctness or confusion about it, and consequently it left no kind of doubt in the mind of Cornelius. <span class="cmt_word">An angel</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">the angel</span>; the addition <span class="cmt_word">of God</span> defines it (see <a href="../../par/acts/5-19.htm">Acts 5:19</a>, note).

Applied to a man, it denotes that state in which the external senses and the volition are suspended, and all his impressions are derived from within (see <a href="../../par/acts/11-5.htm">Acts 11:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17</a>). It is also used to express great astonishment (<a href="../../par/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/3-10.htm">Acts 3:10</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/5-42.htm">Mark 5:42</a>). In the LXX. of <a href="../../par/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a> it is spoken of Adam's <span class="accented">deep sleep</span>, and in <a href="../../par/genesis/27-33.htm">Genesis 27:33</a> of Isaac's <span class="accented">exceeding trembling</span>, and elsewhere of strong emotions.

The vessel coming down from the open heavens implied that the command to eat what was contained in it was given by revelation. The things sent were from God, and the command to eat was from God. Peter's hunger had prepared the way for the particular form of the vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/10-12.htm">Acts 10:12</a></div><div class="verse">Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- Beasts and creeping things of the earth</span> for <span class="accented">beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">heaven</span> for <span class="accented">air</span>, A.V.

Peter's astonishment must, therefore, have been exceeding great at the command to slay and eat. And so his answer in ver. 14 shows. And yet our Lord had taught him the same truth (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-10.htm">Matthew 15:10-20</a>, or still more distinctly <a href="../../par/mark/8-14.htm">Mark 8:14-23</a>).

It is rather a striking testimony to Peter's religious character as a Jew before his call to the apostolate, that, poor Galilaean fisherman as he was, unlearned and ignorant, he had yet always conscientiously obeyed the Law of Moses in regard to things clean and unclean (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8-15</a>). The address, <span class="cmt_word">Lord</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;</span>), seems certainly to recognize the voice as that of Christ, which also agrees with the descent of the vessel from heaven.

The same word is rendered <span class="accented">entertained</span> in <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which is nearer the sense; "to entertain as a guest." The word carries with it that he showed them hospitality, and thus broke down the wall of partition between him and them. "He gave them friendly treatment, and made them at home with him" (Chrysostom). (For <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, see ver. 32.) <span class="cmt_word">He arose and went forth</span>.

It was notorious among the Romans that the Jews kept themselves aloof from other people. Hence the accusation against them, in common with Christians, of being haters of the human race. Tacitus says of them that they hated all people, except their own countrymen, as their enemies, and refused to eat or intermarry with them ("Separati epulis discreti cubilibus;" 'Hist.,' 5:5).

As regards the truth that <span class="cmt_word">God is no respecter of persons</span>, which the present incident had brought home so vividly to Peter's apprehension, there can be no difficulty in understanding it. Cornelius was devout, he feared God, he was fruitful in prayer and almsgiving. God did not say to him, "All this would have been accepted in a Jew, but cannot be noticed in a Gentile." But, Gentile as he was, his prayers and alms went up for a memorial before God. If the things done were good in themselves, they were equally good whoever did them.

This constant reference to the testimony of eye-witnesses is an indication of the thoroughly historical character of Christianity, and of the importance of Christian evidences. The new matter which Peter was to bring before Cornelius and his company begins at ver. 40, but with the prefatory remarks in ver. 39, which both attest the truth of what Cornelius already knew and prepare for the following revelation. <span class="cmt_word">Who did eat and drink</span> (see <a href="../../par/luke/24-30.htm">Luke 24:30, 41-43</a>; <a href="../../par/john/21-12.htm">John 21:12</a>, etc.).

But the explanation of it is to be found in the circumstance of St. Luke himself being a Gentile; perhaps also, as Alford suggests, in his use of language suited to the time when he wrote. It is an indication, too, of the purpose of St. Luke in writing his history, viz. to chronicle the progress of Gentile Christianity. Peter, having completed his rounds (<a href="../../par/acts/9-32.htm">Acts 9:32</a>), returned to Jerusalem, which was still the abode of the apostles. He was, no doubt, anxious to commune with his brother apostles upon the momentous matter of the Gentile converts; but he was at once attacked by the bigotry of the zealous Jews.

There was a large population of Jews, whom Seleucus attracted to his new city by giving them equal political privileges with the Greeks.

It is supported, however, by strong authority of manuscripts, versions, and Fathers, and is accepted by Grotius, Witsius, Griesbach, Lachman, Tischendorf, Meyer, Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Westcott, Bishop Lightfoot, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' (apparently) and most modern critics. It is also strongly argued that the internal evidence proves <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> to be the right reading, because the statement that the men of Cyprus and Cyrene preached the gospel to them is contrasted with the action of the others, who preached to the Jews only. Obviously, therefore, these Hellenes were not Jews. Moreover, there was nothing novel in the conversion and admission into the Church of Hellenistic Jews (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-5.htm">Acts 2:5</a>, etc.; Acts 9:22, 29). And these very preachers were in all probability Hellenists themselves. Bishop Wordsworth, however, on the contrary, defends, though with doubt, the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; and argues that even if <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> is the right reading, it must mean the same as <span class="greek">&#x1f19;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. He also hints that it might mean "proselytes" (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>, where the Hellenes attend the synagogue, and <a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). But there is no evidence that these were proselytes any more than Cornelius was. The Hellenes, or Greeks, here were probably uncircumcised Greeks who feared God, like Cornelius, and attended the synagogue worship (see Meyer on <a href="../../par/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>). It is very likely that in Antioch, where the Jews occupied such a prominent position, some of the Greek inhabitants should be attracted by their doctrines and worship, repelled, perhaps, by the prevalent superstitions and profligate levity of the great city.

The news of this accession of Gentiles to the Church was quickly carried to Jerusalem, with the same motive, probably, that brought thither the account of the baptism of Cornelius and his household, as we read in vers. 1-3 of this chapter. The conduct of the Church in sending so excellent and temperate a person. as Barnabas (as we read in the next verse), the friend of Saul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>) and a favorer of preaching the gospel to Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1, 2</a>) to inspect the work at Antioch, is an indication that they had already heard the account of the conversion of Cornelius from the mouth of Peter, and were already led to the conclusion, "Then to the Gentiles also hath God granted repentance unto life!" There is no clue whatever to the length of time that elapsed between the flight from persecution and the arrival at Antioch, except that Saul had had time to sojourn three years in Arabia, to come to Jerusalem, and from thence to go and settle at Tarsus, where Barnabas found him; thus leaving abundant time for Peter's operations in Judaea and Caesarea.

It was a memorable event in the history of the Church when the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span>, which has distinguished them for nearly eighteen centuries and a half, was given to the disciples of Christ. Hitherto they had been called among themselves disciples, and brethren, and saints, and, by the Jews, men "of the Way" (<a href="../../par/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>), or "Nazarenes" (<a href="../../par/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>), but now they received the name of <span class="accented">Christians, as</span> followers of Christ, from the outside world, and accepted it themselves (<a href="../../par/acts/26-28.htm">Acts 26:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/4-16.htm">1 Peter 4:16</a>). From the Latin form of the word <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Christ (like Herodians, followers of Herod; Marians, Pompeians, partisans of Marius and Pompey; Caesariani, Ciceroniani, Vitelliani, Flaviani, etc.; Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:130; Lewin, vol. 1:97), the designation most have been invented by the Gentiles, either by the Roman court or camp at Antioch, or by the Greek population, influenced as they were by Roman forms of speech current amongst them (compare the Greece-Oriental Nestorians, Arians, etc.). We may be sure that <span class="accented">Christians, i.e.</span> followers of Messiah, is not a name likely to have been given by Jews. There is no evidence either of its having been given in derision. The well-known account of Tacitus is "Vulgus Christianos appella-bat. Auctor nominis ejus Christus, Tiberio imperitante, per Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat" ('Annal.,' 15:44). Suidas says that those who had been previously called <span class="accented">Nazarenes</span> and <span class="accented">Galileans</span>, in the reign of Claudius Caesar, when Euodius had been made Bishop of Antioch by Peter, had their name changed into that of <span class="accented">Christians.</span> He seems to refer to the statement of Malalas (quoted by Conybeare and Howson, 1:131), that they who had been before called Nazarenes and Galileans received the name of <span class="accented">Christians</span> in the time of Euodius, who succeeded St. Peter as Bishop of Antioch, and who himself gave them this name." Malalas is thought to have lived somewhere between the sixth and ninth centuries, at Byzantium. A beautiful passage in the Clementine Liturgy is also quoted at p. 130: "We give thee thanks that we are called by the Name of thy Christ, and are thus reckoned as thine own," where the allusion is to <a href="../../par/james/2-7.htm">James 2:7</a>. The name <span class="accented">Christian</span> is frequent in the epistles of Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch; Polycarp's dying words were, "I am a Christian" (Bishop Wordsworth).

In point of fact, the predicted famine, which began in the fourth year of Claudius Caesar (A.D. 44) and lasted till A.D. , fell upon Judea exclusively, as far as appears from Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' lit. 15:3; 20. 2:5, 5:2), and was very severe there. Ishmael was high priest at the time; and Helena, Queen of Adiahene, fetched large supplies of corn from Egypt and of figs from Cyprus to Jerusalem, to supply the wants of the people. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8) speaks of this famine as having prevailed "over the world," and as being recorded by authors hostile to Christianity, but mentions no names and gives no particulars ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:8), but in the twelfth chapter of the same book he limits it to <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, Judaea. There were several other historical famines in the reign of Claudius, but they can hardly be included in the prophecy of Agabus. The prophet Agabus is mentioned again in <a href="../../par/acts/21-10.htm">Acts 21:10</a>, and again as coming from Judaea. Renan ascribes the poverty-stricken condition of the Jerusalem Christians to their communistic institutions.

This is the first mention of presbyters, or elders, in the Church at Jerusalem, which was now fully organized. James the Less was the resident apostle (?) and bishop; with him were the presbyters (<a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>); and under them again the seven deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5, 6</a>). The presbyters of the Church of Jerusalem are mentioned again in <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="../../par/james/5-13.htm">James 5:13</a>, where, however, the elders of other Churches in Judaea may possibly be included. A difficulty arises with regard to Saul's mission to Jerusalem with Barnabas, as to how to reconcile it with <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, which speaks of St. Paul's second visit to Jerusalem as taking place fourteen years after his first, whereas this visit could not be above four or <span class="accented">five</span> years after. But there are three hypotheses about the visit to Jerusalem referred to in <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The first identifies it with the visit here recorded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The second identifies it with that related in <a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a>, etc., which is supported by most of the best authorities ancient and modern (see note on Acts 15.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The third, which is advocated by Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1:302, etc.), identifies it with the visit recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>. As regards the first, with which we are now concerned, though at first sight you would have ex-peered St. Paul's next visit to Jerusalem after his conversion to be the one alluded to in Galatians it., yet the following circumstances make this impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The date of the visit named in Galatians it, which is distinctly stated to be <span class="accented">fourteen</span> years after that recorded in <a href="../../par/acts/9-26.htm">Acts 9:26</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> When St. Paul went to Jerusalem on the occasion adverted to in Galatians it.," he laid before them the gospel which he preached among the Gentiles." But at the time of this visit he had not yet begun his labors among the Gentiles (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>), to which he was only called after his return (<a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> On the occasion spoken of in Galatians it, Paul and Barnabas were received by the chief apostles, and must have passed a considerable time at Jerusalem, with many consultations and meetings, public and private. But on this occasion, as far as appears, their visit was a very hasty one, and they saw no one but the presbyters, and returned as soon as they had handed over the collection to them (<a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>). The conclusion, therefore, seems quite certain that this is not the visit referred to in Galatians it. And the hasty nature of this visit explains at once why St. Paul made no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. It had no bearing upon the course of his argument. It was not a visit to Jerusalem in the sense in which he was speaking, and he saw none of the apostles. The state of the Church at the time, James the son of Zebedee killed, Peter in prison or lately escaped "to another place" (<a href="../../par/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>), the other apostles very likely dispersed, made it impossible. He therefore took no count of it in his statement to the Galatians. This seems quite a sufficient explanation (see the note of Bishop Ellicott on <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, and Bishop Lightfoot's convincing remarks at p. 113 of his 'Epistle to the Galatians'). There is no occasion to resort to the violent expedient of Renan, and say that Saul did not go with Barnabas at this time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/acts/12.htm"><title>Acts 12 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/acts/12.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/acts/12.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/acts/12-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../acts/11.htm" title="Acts 11">&#9668;</a> Acts 12 <a href="../acts/13.htm" title="Acts 13">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth <i>his</i> hands to vex certain of the church.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Put</span> for <span class="accented">stretched</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">afflict</span> for <span class="accented">vex</span>, A.V. The phrase, About that time, as in <a href="../../par/acts/19-23.htm">Acts 19:23</a>, points to what had just before been related (Meyer). The interposition of the narrative in this chapter between <a href="../../par/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a> and Acts 12:25 evidently implies that the bulk or rather the chief of the events narrated happened in the interval. Which of the events was the chief in the mind of the narrator with reference to his general narrative, and what are the coincidences which he wished to note, it is not easy to say with certainty. The narrative in this chapter doubtless overlaps at both ends the embassy of Paul and Barnabas, but perhaps the object was to show the harassed state of the Church from famine and persecution at the time that Paul and Barnabas were at Jerusalem. Herod the king here mentioned is Herod Agrippa I., grandson of Herod the Great, and son of Aristobulus and Bernice. During the reign of Tiberius he resided at Rome, in alternate favor and disgrace, sometimes banished, sometimes a prisoner, sometimes a guest at the imperial court. He was a great friend of Caius Caesar Caligula, and, on his succeeding to the empire on the death of Tiberius, was promoted by him to the tetrarchy of Herod Philip, with the title of king. He was further advanced three years afterwards to the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas; and, on the accession of Claudius to the throne, Judaea and Samaria were added to his dominions, which now comprised the whole kingdom of his grandfather, Herod the Great. Agrippa, in spite of his close intimacy with Drusus, Caligula, Claudius, and other Roman magnates, was "exactly careful in the observance of the laws of his country, not allowing a day to pass without its appointed sacrifice;" and he had given proof of his strong Jewish feeling by interposing his whole influence with Caligula to prevent his statue being placed in the holy of holies. This spirit accounts for his enmity against the Church. He was a man of very expensive and luxurious habits, but not without some great qualities.

Nothing is recorded of him in the Acts but his presence in the upper room at Jerusalem after the Ascension (<a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), and this his martyrdom, which was the fulfillment of our Lord's prediction in <a href="../../par/matthew/20-23.htm">Matthew 20:23</a>. His being singled out by Herod for death in company with Peter is rather an indication of his zeal and activity in the Lord's service, though we know nothing of his work. Eusebius relates an anecdote of his martyrdom, extracted from the lost work of Clement of Alexandria, called the <span class="greek">&#x1f59;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (or in Latin <span class="accented">Adumbrationes</span>), which Clement professed to have received by tradition from his predecessors, to the effect that the informer who accused James was so struck with his constancy in confessing Christ before the judge, that he came forward and confessed himself a Christian too. The two were then led off to execution together; and on the way the informer asked James's forgiveness. After a moment's hesitation, James said to him, "Peace be unto thee," and kissed him. They were then both beheaded ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 9.). As Clement flourished about A.D. , the tradition need not have passed through more than three persons. It has been thought strange that Luke relates the death of a chief apostle with such brevity. But it did not bear on the main object of his work. Lightfoot ('Works,' vol. 8. p. 282, etc.) mentions a fanciful story related by Rabauus Maurus, that about this time the apostles composed the Apostles' Creed, each contributing one clause, and that the clause contributed by James the brother of John was, "And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord."

So Hegesippus, quoted by Eusebius ('Eccl. <span class="accented">Hist.</span>,' <span class="accented">2:</span>23), "James the Lord's brother, called by universal consent the Just, received the government of the Church together with the apostles;" and in <a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1</a> he quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that, after the Ascension, Peter, James, and John selected James the Just, the Lord's brother, to be the first Bishop of Jerusalem. And Eusebius gives it as the general testimony of antiquity that James the Just, the Lord's brother, was the first who sat on the episcopal throne of Jerusalem. But who he was exactly is a point much controverted. The three hypotheses are: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That he was the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary, sister to the blessed Virgin, and therefore our Lord's cousin german, and called his brother by a common Hebrew idiom. According to this theory he was one of the twelve (<a href="../../par/luke/6-15.htm">Luke 6:15</a>), as he appears to be in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>, though this is not certain (see Bishop Lightfoot, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That he was the son of Joseph by his first wife, and so stepbrother to the Lord, which is Eusebius's explanation ('Eccl. Hist.,' 2:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> That he was in the full sense the Lord's brother, being the son of Joseph and Mary. This is the opinion of Alford (<span class="accented">in lee.</span>), fully argued in the 'Proleg. to the Epistle of James,' and of Meyer, Credner, and many German commentators. According to these two last hypotheses, he was not one of the twelve. "The apostolic constitutions distinguish between James the son of Alphaeus, the apostle, and James the brother of the Lord, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (Meyer). It may be added that <a href="../../par/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> separates the brethren of the Lord from the apostles, who are enumerated in the preceding verses. The hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with James the son of Alphaeus or Clopas and Mary is well argued in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "James" (see also the able Introduction to the Epistle of James in the 'Speaker's Commentary'). It seems impossible to come to a certain conclusion. The weakest point in the hypothesis which identifies James the Lord's brother with the son of Alphaeus is that it fails to account for the distinction clearly made between the Lord's brothers and the apostles in such passages as <a href="../../par/john/2-12.htm">John 2:12</a>; <a href="../../par/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 5, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46, 49</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-5.htm">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>. For the effect of these passages is scarcely neutralized by <a href="../../par/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>. But then, on the other hand, the hypothesis that the Lord's brethren, including James and Joses, were the children of Joseph and Mary, seems to be flatly contradicted by the mention of Mary the wife of Clopas as being "the mother of James and Jests" (<a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="../../par/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He went to another place</span>. Whether Luke was not informed what the place was, or whether there was some reason why he did not mention it, we cannot tell. The Venerable Bode ('Prolog. in Expos. in Act. Apost.'), Baronius, and other authorities of the Church of Rome, say he went to Rome, and commenced his episcopate of Rome at this time Dr Lightfoot thinks it more probable that he went to Antioch (Comm. on Acts, in vol. 8. pp. 273, 289).

The blood of the martyr James was the seed of the Church, and the speedy vengeance taken by God upon the persecuter doubtless gave fresh courage to his people to confess the Name of Jesus Christ. As regards the preceding account of Herod Agrippa's death, it is corroborated in the most remarkable manner by the narrative in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 8:2). He there tells that when he had been three years King of all Judaea (see ver. 1, note) he went to Caesarea. And that on occasion of a festival celebrated "for the safety of Caesar" (some think to celebrate his return from Britain, while others, as Wieseler, think that they were the ordinary Quinquennalia, celebrated in the provinces), he exhibited games and spectacles in honor of Claudius. On the second day of these games, when a vast number of people were assembled in the theatre, Agrippa can? m, clothed in a garment wholly made of silver, which reflected the rays of the morning sun with a most dazzling and awful brilliancy. Whereupon his flatterers cried out that he was a god, and offered prayer to him. The king, he adds, did not rebuke them nor reject their impious flattery, he was presently seized with a violent pain in his bowels, which soon became so intense that he was carried out of the theatre to his palace, and expired after five days of excruciating pain. It is curious that in the above account Josephus says that Agrippa saw an owl sitting over his head, which he recognized as a messenger (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of evil to him. Eusebius, quoting Josephus Eccl. Hist.,' 2. 10.), leaves out the owl, and says that Agrippa saw an angel sitting over his head, whom he recognized as the cause of his sufferings. Whiston, in a note, seeks to exonerate Eusebius from unfairness in the quotation by suggesting that the manuscript of Eusebius is in this place corrupt; but Bede quotes Josephus just as Eusebius does, unless perchance he is quoting him at second hand from Eusebius.

The fact here stated of their taking John Mark with them, is very interesting in connection with ver. 12. Whether or no Saul and Barnabas were in the house of Mary at the time of Peter's deliverance from prison, they evidently went there shortly before or shortly after. As regards the sequence of events related in this chapter, it is by no means necessary to suppose that Barnabas and Saul did not leave Jerusalem till after the death of Agrippa. Luke, connecting the death of Agrippa with his murder of James and his intended murder of Peter, as Eusebius and Chrysostom and others rightly say, would naturally follow up the narrative of the persecution by the narrative of the persecutor's awful death; and then go on to relate the return of the two apostles to Antioch in continuation of <a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. We have no means of deciding whether, in point of fact, they returned before or after Agrippa's death. It seems most probable that they returned before, as, under the circumstances, they would not tarry at Jerusalem longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of their ministration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/13.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 13"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 13" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

See also note on Acts 4:26).

The <span class="accented">teachers</span> would appear to differ from the prophets in that they were not under the ecstatic influence of the Holy Spirit, and did not utter exhortations or prophecies in a poetic strain, but were expounders of Christian truth, under the teaching of the Spirit. What they spoke was called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>), and their function was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="../../par/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is reckoned among the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been <span class="accented">sodalis</span> to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a></div><div class="verse">As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- And as</span> for <span class="accented">as</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">They ministered</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not, as Meyer explains it, the whole Church, but the prophets and teachers, doubtless at an assembly of the Church.

In the Old Testament the LXX. use it as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, to minister (often with the addition "to God," or "to the Lord "), which is a general word applying to the ministrations of priests and Levites (<a href="../../par/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>, etc.). Hence its use in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a> (see too <a href="../../par/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Joshua too is called Moses'minister (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>) in <a href="../../par/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, etc., and the angels are called <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "ministering spirits" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Just as the Church transferred from the Jewish congregation so many other words and things, so also the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to Sicily "Divine service," without specifying the particular office, whether prayer, or preaching, or Holy Communion, or ordination, or any ether part of the worship of God. Its classical use was to designate any office performed by an individual for the public good. Hence in the New Testament its application to Church alms (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>), to gifts for the support of the ministry (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>), to the office of magistrates (<a href="../../par/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>), etc. The restricted application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist was of much later growth, as is evident from Chrysostom explaining the word here of preaching. "What means ministering? Preaching" (Hom. 27.). It seems to have arisen from the fact that the first forms of prayer were those come posed for the office of the Holy Communion. This passage, therefore, does not give the slightest support to fasting Communion. What was the exact occasion of the service and fast here spoken of it is impossible to say. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost said</span>, etc. This is the origin of the question in the Ordination of Deacons, "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office?" <span class="cmt_word">Separate me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The act of separation, or ordination, would be by the laying on of the hands of Symeon and Lucius and Manaen, as Chrysostom says (at least of the two last named), in the presence of the whole Church, but the separation by the Holy Ghost, at least as regards Saul (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>), bad been from his mother's womb (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). Observe, too, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="../../par/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here. This is another instance of the very close resemblance between parts of the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians, which looks as if St. Paul was writing it about the same time as he was giving to St. Luke the details of his own history (see <a href="../../par/acts/8-19.htm">Acts 8:19</a>, note). The ordination was to the apostolate (Chrysostom). Barnabas and Saul are never called apostles till after their ordination or consecration (<a href="../../par/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid <i>their</i> hands on them, they sent <i>them</i> away.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- Then</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V. It does not follow that the laying on of hands was on the same day. On the contrary, the mention of the fasting again in this verse makes it impossible so to understand it. Doubtless, on receiving this intimation of the Spirit, they fixed a day for the ordination, and prepared for it by fasting and prayer. The ember days of the Church before ordinations are m accordance with this precedent of Holy Scripture. With this departure of Barnabas and Saul commences the second and main part of the Acts of the apostles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a></div><div class="verse">So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Went down to</span> for <span class="accented">departed unto</span>, A.V. (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Seleucia was the sea-port of Antioch, about sixteen miles from it, and five miles north of the mouth of the Orontes. It was a free city by a grant from Pompey. It is now in ruins, but "the masonry of the once magnificent port of Seleucia is in so good a state that" it might be repaired and cleared out "for about &pound;31,000" (Colonel Chesney, quoted in Lewin, 1. p. 119). They sailed to Cyprus. Barnabas, no doubt, took the lead, and was naturally drawn to his native island of Cyprus - within a hundred miles of Seleucia, and, on a clear day, visible from it. The number of Jews in the island, and the partial evangelization of it which had already taken place (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19, 20</a>), and which promised them assistance and support, no doubt further influenced them. John Mark went with them, as we learn from the fifth and thirteenth verses, and possibly other brethren as deacons and ministers (see next note). They sailed straight to Salamis, "a convenient and capacious <span class="accented">harbor</span>," in the center of the eastern end of the island, and the principal or one of the principal towns. It had a large population of Jews. It was destroyed in the reign of Trajan, in consequence of a terrible insurrection of the Jews, in which they massacred 240,000 of the Gentile population. No Jew was ever after allowed to land in Cyprus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to <i>their</i> minister.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Proclaimed</span> for <span class="accented">preached</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">as their attendant</span> for <span class="accented">to their minister</span>, A.V.

Here it is synonymous with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, a deacon. John was to Barnabas and Saul what Joshua was to Moses, Elisha to Elijah, etc. Peter, when he went to Caesarea, was accompanied by six brethren (<a href="../../par/acts/11-12.htm">Acts 11:12</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name <i>was</i> Barjesus:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The <span class="accented">whole island</span> for <span class="accented">the isle</span>, A.V. and T.R.

But here, as in <a href="../../par/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>, it has a bad sense. It is a Persian word, and in its original use designated a Persian religious caste, famous for their knowledge, wisdom, and purity of religious faith. They were attached to the court of the Babylonian monarchs, and were deemed to have great skill in astrology, in interpretation of dreams, and the like (see <a href="../../par/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4-7.htm">Daniel 4:7</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a> in the LXX.). In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3, 13</a>, the name <span class="accented">Rab-mag</span> seems to mean "the chief of the magi." But in process of time the word "magus" came to mean a sorcerer, a magician, a practicer of dark arts, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Simon Magus (see the chapter on magic in Pliny, 'Nat.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-7.htm">Acts 13:7</a></div><div class="verse">Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- The proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy of</span> the <span class="accented">country</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of understanding</span> for <span class="accented">a prudent man</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the same</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">unto him</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sought</span> for <span class="accented">desired</span>, A.V.

Cyprus had become a proconsular province in the reign of Claudius, having previously been one of the emperor's provinces governed by a propraetor, or legatus. A man of understanding (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is a rare word in the New Testament, and is always translated in the A.V. "prudent" (see <a href="../../par/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-19.htm">1 Corinthians 1:19</a>). It is common in the LXX., where it represents the Hebrew words <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, all signifying "intelligence," "skill," "knowledge," and the like. The substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> has the same scope (see <a href="../../par/luke/2-47.htm">Luke 2:47</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-4.htm">Ephesians 3:4</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9</a>, etc.); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, therefore, means something more than "<span class="accented">a</span> prudent man." It means a man of knowledge and superior intelligence and understanding. And such was Sergius Paulus, a noble Roman, who is twice named by Pliny in the list of authors placed at the commencement of his work as the authorities from whom he derived the matter contained in the several books. It is not a little remarkable that the two books, lib. it. and lib. 18, for which Sergius Paulus is quoted are just those which contain accounts of the heavenly bodies, and prognostications from the sun and moon and stars, from thunder, from the clouds, and such like things, which doubtless formed the staple of Elymas's science; so that there can be little doubt that Sergius Paulus had Elymas with him, that he might learn from him such matters as might be useful for the hook which he was writing. There is also a curious passage in lib. 30. cap. 1. of the 'Hist. Nat.'(quoted by Lewin, vol. 1. p. 128), in which Pliny, after enumerating the most famous teachers of magic, Zoroaster, Orthanes, Pythagoras, and others, adds, "There is also another school of magic which springs from Moses and Jannes, who were Jews, but many thousand years later than Zoroaster; so much more recent is the school of Cyprus;" showing that he knew of a school of magic art at Cyprus taught by Jews, and leading us to infer that he had acquired this knowledge either from the pen or the mouth of Sergius Paulus. Anyhow, a remarkable confirmation of St. Luke's narrative. Another Sergius Paulus, who might be a son or grandson of the proconsul, is highly commended by Galen for his eminent philosophical attainments (Lewin, vol. 1. p. 127). One L. Sergius Paulus was consul suffectus in A.D. , another in A.D. . Renan thinks they may have been descendants of the Sergius Paulus in the text.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then Saul, (who also <i>is called</i> Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set his eyes on him,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">is also</span> for <span class="accented">also is</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">fastened</span> for <span class="accented">set</span>, A.V. (above, Acts ill 4, note). Who is also called Paul. The explanation of Jerome, Augustine, Bede, and many modern commentators, as Meyer, Olshausen, etc., and not rejected by Renan, is that Saul took the name of Paul on the occasion of this remarkable and important conversion of Sergius Paulus. Saul's future intercourse with Gentiles made it desirable that, after the common custom of the Jews of his day - as seen in Peter, Stephen, Mark, Lucius, Jason, Crispus, Justus, Niger, Aquila, Priscilla, Drusilla etc. - he should have a Gentile name, and so, in honor of his illustrious convert, or in memory of his conversion, or at the special request of Sergius Paulus (Baronius), he took the name of Paul, which in sound was not unlike his Hebrew name. The fact of this change of name being recorded by St. Luke at this precise moment makes this the most simple and natural explanation. Compare Gideon's change of name to Jerubbaal (<a href="../../par/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/8-29.htm">Judges 8:29, 35</a>). Alford, on the ether hand, thinks it strange that any one should make such a mistake as Jerome's, and says that "this notice marks the transition from the former part of his history" - "gathered from the narratives of others" - to "the joint memoirs of himself and St. Paul." But this gives no account of the coincidence of the two Pauls, nor is it true that the latter half of the Acts begins here. It began at ver. 1, and the name of Saul has been retained three times in the early part of this chapter. Farrar speaks of this explanation as, long and deservedly abandoned," and as having in it an element of vulgarity. Howson thinks that <span class="accented">Paul</span> had long been his Roman name, but that the conversion of Sergius Paulus, as it were, stereotyped the Roman name as that by which the apostle was henceforth to be known. The idea of Augustine and others, that he took the name of Paul (<span class="accented">paulus</span>, small) from humility, to indicate that he was "the least" of the apostles, is fanciful. Neither is Chrysostom's assertion, that he changed his name at his ordination or consecration, borne out by the facts. Renan ('Saint Paul,' 1:19) notes that "Paul" was a very common name in Cilicia. No certainty can be arrived at in the matter.

As regards the reason why the particular punishment of blindness was inflicted upon Elymas, it might be to put a forcible interruption upon those observations of the stars and clouds by which the magician pretended to foresee the future.

A very marked change may here be observed in the relations of Barnabas and Paul. Hitherto Barnabas has always occupied the first rank. It has been "Barnabas and Saul" (<a href="../../par/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>; vers. 2, 7).

Renan dwells much on the beauty of Barnabas's character as seen in his cheerful acquiescence in this change of relative position, and his single-minded devotion to the success of the work. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Perga</span>, the capital of Pamphylia, in that part of the coast of Asia Minor which looks due south. Perga was about seven and a half miles inland, on the river Cestrus, which is navigable. There was a constant intercourse between Paphos the capital of Cyprus, and Perga the capital of Pamphylia, fostered probably by the two famous temples of Venus and Diana. The word for set sail (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is a nautical term, meaning sailing from the shore or harbor into the open sea (see <a href="../../par/acts/16-11.htm">Acts 16:11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-1.htm">Acts 21:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a>). At Perga John Mark left them. Perhaps his position as Barnabas's cousin was less pleasant now that Paul took the first place; perhaps his courage failed him now that they were fairly launched out into the heathen world, where, unlike Cyprus, his Jewish kinsmen were a small minority, and the dangers and fatigues were great. Pamphylia was now governed by a propraetor, being an imperial province. Its name denotes that it was inhabited by a mixed race - men of all tribes, aborigines, Cilicians, Greeks, etc.

The natural conclusion is that that speech made a deep impression upon St. Paul when he heard it at Stephen's trial. The common purpose in the two speeches is to conciliate and gain the attention of the Jewish hearers by dwelling upon the great events of the history of their fathers, of which they were proud, and claiming for Christians an equal heritage in that history. The speeches diverge in that Stephen sought to show in that history instances of the same stubborn unbelief in their fathers which had led the children to crucify the Lord of glory; but St. Paul rather sought to show how the promises made to their fathers had their fulfillment in that Jesus whom he preached unto them, and how the crucifixion of Christ by the Jerusalem Jews was an exact fulfillment of the Law and the prophets which had just been read to them in the synagogue. In both speeches it is a great point to exhibit Christianity as the true development of Judaism (comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> and throughout).

It is difficult to say what is the meaning of the R.T. in regard to the four hundred and fifty years, what is the terminus a <span class="accented">quo</span> or <span class="accented">ad quem</span> intended by it. The usual explanations of the reading of the R.T. (adopted by Lachman, Bishop Wordsworth, and others) is that the years are dated from the birth of Isaac, and that the meaning is that the promise to give the land to the seed of Abraham was actually performed within four hundred and fifty years (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) (after the analogy of <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>), which gives a good sense and is not at all improbable (see Bishop Wordsworth's note). The reading of the T.R. has grave objections on the score of chronology as well as grammar. Duration of time is expressed by the accusative case, as vers. 18 and 21; the measure of time in which a thing is done by the dative. So that the natural rendering of the T.R. would be that he gave them judges four hundred and fifty years after the entrance into Canaan; which of course cannot be the meaning. The other objection is that, if the times of the judges from the final conquest of the land to the judgeship of Samuel was four hundred and fifty years, the whole time from the Exodus to the building of the temple must have been about six hundred and forty years (37 from death of Moses to Othuiel + 450, + 30 for judgeship of Samuel, + 40 of Saul's reign, + 40 for David's reign, +3 years of Solomon, + and the 40 years in the wilderness), whereas <a href="../../par/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> gives the time as four hundred and eighty years; while the genealogies suppose a much shorter time - about two hundred and eighty years. It is an immense gain, therefore, to get rid of this four hundred and fifty years for the time of the judges, and by the well-supported reading of the R.T. to get a calculation in agreement with <a href="../../par/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> and with the chronology of the times. <span class="cmt_word">Gave them... for an inheritance</span>.

But it maybe taken as expressing the cause why this salvation is complete and capable of being offered to them. This salvation is preached to you because, through the instrumentality of those that dwell at Jerusalem, all that was written in the Scriptures concerning Christ has been fulfilled.

Who are meant? and what ascent from Galilee to Jerusalem is here intended? The answer to the first question is, the eleven apostles, whose special office it was to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (<a href="../../par/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>, note). The answer to the second is, that the ascent from Galilee, where most of our Lord's appearances took place, to Jerusalem, shortly before the Ascension, is here intended, and that this passage is a distinct recognition by St. Luke of the Galilaean appearances. There is, as is well known, great obscurity, and apparent discrepancies in the accounts of our Lord's appearances after the Resurrection. St. Matthew seems to place them exclusively in Galilee (<a href="../../par/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7, 10, 16</a>). St. Mark likewise (16: 7); but in the section 9-20 he mentions the appearance to Mary Magdalene and to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus, but gives no clue as to where the appearance to the eleven took place. St. Luke seems to place them exclusively in Judaea, but very curiously puts a mention of Galilee in the angel's mouth in the very place where, according to St. Matthew, he announced the Lord's appearance in Galilee. St. John, again places the three first appearances in Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/john/20.htm">John 20</a>.), but describes at length a third as having taken place in Galilee (<a href="../../par/john/21-2.htm">John 21:2, 14</a>). St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>) speaks of an appearance to five hundred brethren at once, which in all probability took place in Galilee, as only a hundred and twenty names were numbered at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>). It is, therefore, satisfactory to have this confirmation of the residence of the apostles in Galilee between the Resurrection and the Ascension in St. Luke's report of St. Paul's speech. Observe that St. Paul distinctly separates himself from these witnesses by the emphatic <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 32.

There can be no reasonable doubt that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, raised up, means here, as in ver. 44, raised from the dead. Observe with what skill the apostle speaks of the resurrection of Jesus Christ as the fulfillment of God's promise to their fathers, which it was to be presumed they were anxiously expecting. The second psalm. Many manuscripts and editions have, "the first," because the first psalm was often reckoned not numerically but as an introduction to the whole book, so that the second psalm was numbered as the first. This is probably the reason why the eighteen psalms as reckoned by the Jews include <a href="../../par/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19</a>, though Joshua ben Levi explains it by the rejection of the second psalm, on account, no doubt, of its testimony to Messiah as God's begotten Son. But the rabbins generally acknowledge the application of this psalm to Messiah (Lightfoot, 'Exercit. on the Acts'). <span class="cmt_word">Thou art my Son</span>, etc. This application of the second psalm to the Resurrection is best explained by <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The reference in both passages to David is remarkable (vers. 22, 23). Christ, who was begotten of the Father before all worlds, was declared before men and angels to be the Son of God, when he was raised from the dead in the power of an endless life.

This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (<a href="../../par/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him."

And in like manner, in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> means "the mercies of God to David." And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "My mercy shall not depart from him." And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sure," or "established for ever," which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though properly meaning "holy, pious," and thence "mild" and "merciful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (<a href="../../par/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., "the sure mercies of David;" the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, represents the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex. (quoted by Schleusner) uses it in the same way for "mercies or "benefits:" <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "<span class="accented">For</span> how many mercies are we indebted to Christ!" In a similar way, the Latin <span class="accented">pietas</span> is used for God's "justice" or "kindness" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). "Trini pulses pietatem" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): "Beat at the door of God's mercy." Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V. H.,' 8:1, where he ascribes to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the primitive sense of what is "just" and "due," from man either to God or to his fellowman, adds, "Tribuunt quidem LXX? interpetiam Deo <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: sod etiam tum significat quoddam quasi <span class="accented">offcium</span> benignitatia in heroines pios, Deo decorum."

St. Paul took the LXX. as he found it. Perhaps he saw signs in some of that unbelief and perverse opposition which afterwards broke out (ver. 45), and so was led to close his sermon with words of awful warning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-42.htm">Acts 13:42</a></div><div class="verse">And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - And <span class="accented">as they went out</span> for when <span class="accented">the Jews were gone out of the synagogue</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">they</span> for <span class="accented">the Gentiles</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">spoken</span> for <span class="accented">preached</span>, A.V. They besought. The R.T. is that of Chrysostom and the best manuscripts, and is adopted by Meyer, Olshausen, Lange, Afford, Bishop Wordsworth, the 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc. There is a difference of opinion as to who is meant by <span class="accented">they.</span> The simplest explanation is that <span class="accented">they</span> means Paul and Barnabas, who went out of the synagogue before the formal dismissal of the congregation; and, as they were going out, received an invitation to repeat their instruction on the next sabbath. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/13-43.htm">Acts 13:43</a></div><div class="verse">Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - The <span class="accented">synagogue broke up</span> for <span class="accented">the congregation was broken up</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the devout</span> for <span class="accented">religious</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">urged</span> for persuaded, A.V. This verse manifestly describes something subsequent to the event recorded in the preceding. The congregation had asked Paul and Barnabas, perhaps through the ruler of the synagogue, to return next sabbath. But when the congregation broke up, many Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas to their own house and received further instructions and exhortation to continue in the grace of God. No doubt Barnabas had his full share in this more private ministry of exhortation (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>, note, and Acts 11:23). (For the meaning of "to continue in the grace of God," see <a href="../../par/galatians/5-4.htm">Galatians 5:4</a>.)

Compare, too, our Lord's saying (<a href="../../par/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>) and the woman's reply (ibid. 27). In point of fact, this had been the practice of Paul and Barnabas no less than of Peter, and was the very motive that had brought them to Antioch. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, we turn to the Gentiles</span>.

No other Lycaonian word is known (see "Jablouskii Disquis. de Ling. Lycaon," in Stephan., 'Thesaur.').

The belief that <span class="cmt_word">the gods were come down in the likeness of men</span>, and that these gods were Jupiter and Hermes, or Mercury, was most natural to Lycaonians, who were conversant with, and doubtless believed, the Phrygian legend of Philemon and Baucis, who entertained hospitably Jupiter and Hermes, when no one else would take them in, and whose cottage was by the gods turned into a temple (when all the neighborhood was drowned by a flood), of which they were made priest and priestess during life, and simultaneously metamorphosed into an oak and lime tree when their life ended (Ovid, 'Metamorph.,'8:611, etc.). Ovid places the scene of the legend at Tyana, the site of which has been ascertained by Hamilton to be near Erekli, in Cappadocia, close to the borders of Lycaonia. The moral drawn in the legend itself seems to have been that which influenced the people of Lycaonia in their conduct towards the two strangers: "Cura pii dis sunt, et qui coluere coluntur," which may be Englished, "Them that honor me I will honor" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).

Seeing a stir at the gates, and hearing that it was the priest of Jupiter coming with oxen and garlands to sacrifice to them, they immediately ran forward to prevent it. The ox was the proper sacrifice for Jupiter.

If the views broached by these Judaean Christians had prevailed, the whole character of Christianity would have been changed, and its existence probably cut short. How great the danger was appears from even Peter and Barnabas having wavered in their opinion. (For St. Paul's treatment of the subject, see <a href="../../par/romans/2-25.htm">Romans 2:25</a>, etc.; 4; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-2.htm">Galatians 5:2-6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/6-12.htm">Galatians 6:12-15</a>, etc.) The expression, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is so like that in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> as to suggest very strongly the consideration whether Peter was not at Antioch at this time, and whether the scene related in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc., did not precede, and in fact cause, the Council of Jerusalem. In this case the "dissension and disputation" spoken of in ver. 2 would include and directly point to the memorable rebuke given by Paul to Peter; and we should understand that Peter, accepting Paul's rebuke, preceded him and Barnabas, and prepared the way at Jerusalem for the solution arrived at. And, indeed, Peter's words at Jerusalem are almost an echo of Paul's words addressed to him at Antioch. If Barnabas had shown a leaning towards the Judaizing party, he would the more readily have been accepted by them as one of the embassy. The chief objection to this hypothesis is that in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a> Peter's visit to Antioch seems to be spoken of as something subsequent to the journey of St. Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem. But it is not in the least necessary so to understand it. St, Paul's mention of his visit to Jerusalem might naturally recall the incident which had led to it, and which was another example of his own independence. Farrar places Peter's visit to Antioch between the Council of Jerusalem and the quarrel with Barnabas, in the time indicated in ver. 35 of this chapter (vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/23.htm">Acts 23</a>.), and so do Conybeare and Howson (vol. 1. p. 238), Meyer, and Alford ('Proleg.,' p. 24; note on Acts 15:36, and <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>). Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 290, etc.) and Lewin (vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>.) place it after St. Paul's return to Antioch, at the conclusion of his second missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22, 23</a>). No absolute certainty can be arrived at, but see note to ver. 35. <span class="cmt_word">Custom</span> (see <a href="../../par/acts/16-21.htm">Acts 16:21</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is the technical term for the Mosaic institutions, used by Josephus and Philo (see too <a href="../../par/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-2.htm">Acts 15:2</a></div><div class="verse">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - And <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">when therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the brethren</span> (in italics) <span class="accented">appointed</span> for <span class="accented">they determined</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain other of them</span>. One of these would be Titus (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>). The circumstance that, on this occasion, St. Paul did go up to those who were apostles before him, to consult with them on a matter of doctrine, shows at once why he refers so pointedly to this visit in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, etc., and is almost conclusive evidence that this visit is the one there referred to. The companionship of Barnabas; the agreement of the expression, "I went up by revelation," with the fact that he was sent by the Church, doubtless in obedience to some voice of the Spirit, like that mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; the occasion, a dispute about the circumcision of Gentile converts; the line taken by Paul and Barnabas in declaring the conversion of the Gentiles (<a href="../../par/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4, 12</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:27), and the result (<a href="../../par/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5, 7, 9</a>), are all strong, not to say conclusive, marks of the identity of the two visits. <span class="cmt_word">The apostles and elders</span>. This phrase marks the constitution of the governing part of the Church of Jerusalem. The addition in vers. 22 and 23 of "the whole Church," and (according to the T.R.) of "the brethren," shows the part the body of the believers had in approving and sanctioning the decisions of the elders. The transaction marks the position of the Church of Jerusalem as the metropolitan Church of Christendom.

This, of course, would have included Titus, who was present with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1, 3</a>).

One is to consider it as elliptical, and to supply, as the A.V. and R.V. do, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>. So Alford, who compares the construction in <a href="../../par/luke/1-25.htm">Luke 1:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span> must be supplied. But this is a harsh construction. The other and better way is to take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not in the sense of" visiting," but of" looking out," or "endeavoring to find something." The sense of the infinitive after the verb is nearly equivalent to" look out for and took," literally, <span class="accented">looked out how he might take.</span> With a slight modification of meaning, Irenaeus (in 'Speaker's Commentary') renders it" Excogitavit accipere," "planned" or "contrived to take." <span class="cmt_word">A people for his Name</span>; 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> to be called by his Name. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> was the peculiar designation of "the people" of God, answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>).

There is every appearance of the LXX., followed here by St. James, having preserved the true reading. As regards the reading of the R.V. in ver. 18, it is a manifest corruption. It is not the reading of either the Hebrew or the Greek version of Amos, or of any other version; and it makes no sense. Whereas the T.R., which is the reading of Irenaeus (3:12.), as Meyer truly says, "presents a thought completely clear, pious, noble, and inoffensive as regards the connection," though he thinks that a reason for rejecting it. Nothing could be more germane to St. James's argument than thus to show from the words of Amos that God's present purpose of taking the Gentiles to be his people was, like all his other works, formed from the beginning of the world (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-9.htm">Ephesians 1:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>, etc.). As regards the interpretation of the prophecy of Amos intended, the idea seems to be that that apparent ruin of the house and family of David which culminated in the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus would be followed by those "sure mercies of David," which consisted in his resurrection from the dead, his exaltation to the right hand of God, and the gathering in of the Gentiles to his kingdom. The phrase, "the tabernacle of David," is rather difficult, because the word in the Hebrew is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5bb;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, tabernacle or booth of David. It is the word used for the booths at the Feast of Tabernacles, and denotes a temporary shed of branches or the like of a very humble character. It is difficult to say why this word was used, unless it was to show that the house of David had fallen to a low estate before it was pulled down.

Later St. Paul somewhat enlarged the liberty of Gentile converts in respect to meats offered to idols (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-25.htm">1 Corinthians 10:25-28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">What is strangled</span>, etc. The things forbidden are all practices not looked upon as sins by Gentiles, but now enjoined upon them as portions of the Law of Moses which were to be binding upon them, at least for a time, with a view to their living in communion and fellowship with their Jewish brethren. The necessity for some of the prohibitions would cease when the condition of the Church as regards Jews and Gentiles was altered; others were of eternal obligation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-21.htm">Acts 15:21</a></div><div class="verse">For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - From <span class="accented">generations of old</span> for <span class="accented">of old time</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sabbath</span> for <span class="accented">sabbath day</span>, A.V. The meaning of this verse seems to be that, in requiring the above compliances, the council was not enjoining anything new or strange, because the Gentiles who attended the synagogues were familiar with these Mosaic doctrines. It has been often stated that these four prohibitions were in substance the same as the so-called seven precepts of Noah, which were binding upon proselytes of the gate. This is, however, scarcely borne out by the facts. The four prohibitions seem to have been a temporary arrangement adapted to the then condition of the Church, with a view to enabling Christian Jews and Gentiles to live in brotherly fellowship. The Jew was not to require more of his Gentile brother: the Gentile was not to concede less to his Jewish brother. St. Augustine ('Cont. Manich.,' 32, 13), quoted by Meyer, ridicules the idea of Christians in his time being bound by the law of things strangled (see Hooker and Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth, in the same sense).

But it is quite inconceivable that Peter, with all the influence of the Jerusalem Cornell fresh upon him, and after the part he himself took in it, and when his own emissaries, Silas and Judas, had just left Antioch, should act the part there ascribed to him. Nor is it within the region of probability that, so soon after the council, any should have come "from James" to unsay what James had said and written at the council. We may with much confidence place Peter's visit to Antioch before the council, as suggested in note to ver. 1.

The expression in Greek is quite indefinite as to time, and may cover months as well as days.

We see in this choice of Mark by Barnabas the natural partiality of a near relation. We may also see the same flexibility of disposition which made him yield to the influence of the emissaries of James (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who was called</span>. It might seem odd that this description of John should be repeated here after having been given in <a href="../../par/acts/12-25.htm">Acts 12:25</a>.

The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (from which comes the substantive <span class="accented">apostasy</span>) is a strong one, and denotes decided blame, as does the indication of the opposite course, by way of contrast, which he did not take. "He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. "Paul thought good," as regards one who had turned back from the work, "not <span class="accented">to take</span> that man." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the <span class="accented">ipsis-sima verba</span> of the "sharp contention." One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a></div><div class="verse">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - There <span class="accented">arose a sharp contention</span> for <span class="accented">the contention was so sharp between them</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">parted</span> for <span class="accented">departed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">so that</span> for <span class="accented">so sharp</span>...  <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and Barnabas</span> for <span class="accented">and so Barnabas</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">took Mark with him</span> for <span class="accented">took Mark</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sailed away</span> for <span class="accented">sailed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">There arose a sharp contention</span>, etc. The sense "between them" must be supplied, if the English word "contention" is used.

But it is more probable that St. <span class="accented">Luke</span> uses the word here in its common medical sense. In medical writers  - Galen, Hippocrates, etc. - the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is equivalent to what we call <span class="accented">an access</span>, from the Latin <span class="accented">aecessio</span>, used by Celsus, when a disease of some standing takes a turn for the worse, comes to a height, and breaks out into its severest form. This is the sense in which our English word "paroxysm" is used. The meaning of the passage will then be that, after a good deal of uncomfortable feeling and discussion, the difference between Paul and Barnabas, instead of cooling down, broke out into such an acute form that Barnabas went off to Cyprus with Mark, leaving St. Paul to do what he pleased by himself. <span class="cmt_word">And Barnabas</span>, etc. The R.V. is much more accurate. The consequence of the quarrel is said by St. Luke to have been that Barnabas took Mark off with him to Cyprus. The statement that Paul chose Silas is a separate and independent statement, as appears by <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (in the nominative) and <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc6;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span> in the indicative mood. St. Luke's narrative quite sides with St. Paul, and throws the blame of the quarrel, or at least of the separation, upon Barnabas. Renan ('St. Paul,' p. 119) thinks St. Paul was too severe upon John Mark, and that it was ungrateful of him to break with one to whom he owed so much as he did to Barnabas for any cause of secondary importance. He also thinks that the real root of the quarrel lay in the constantly changing relations between the two apostles, aggravated by a domineering spirit in St. Paul. But the force of this censure turns upon the question whether it was a cause of <span class="accented">secondary</span> importance. If St. Paul had a single eye to the success of his mission, and judged that Mark would be a hindrance to it, it was a question <span class="accented">of primary</span> importance to "the work," and St. Paul was right. Renan also remarks upon the extinction of the fame of Barnabas consequent upon this separation from his more illustrious companion. "While Paul kept advancing to the heights of his glory, Barnabas, separated from the companion who had shed a portion of his own luster upon him, pursued his solitary course in obscurity." <span class="cmt_word">Sailed away</span>. Cyprus was Barnabas's native country (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), and the scene of the earliest mission (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>), and of Paul and Barnabas's first joint evangelistic labors (<a href="../../par/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>). Barnabas would have many friends there, and could form plans at his leisure for his future action. The friendly mention of him in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a> shows both that he continued his disinterested labors as an apostle and that the estrangement between him and St. Paul had passed away. The <span class="accented">paroxysm</span> had yielded to the gentle treatment of charity.

This rather looks as if the "some days after" of ver. 36 did not cover a very long time, because the special mention of "the Churches of Syria and Cilicia" indicates that St. Paul's visit had some connection with the epistle addressed to them by the apostles and elders of the Church of Jerusalem (ver. 23), as we see from <a href="../../par/acts/16-4.htm">Acts 16:4</a> was the case. <span class="cmt_word">Confirming</span>; as <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a> (T.R.).

Asia is here used in its restricted sense of that district on the western coast of Asia Minor, of which Ephesus was the capital. It is in this sense that it is used also in <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-10.htm">Acts 19:10</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-11.htm">Revelation 1:11</a>.

Thus was ushered in the most momentous event in the history of Europe, the going forth of the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem to enlighten the nations of the West, and bring them into the fold of Jesus Christ. Paul saw and heard this in a vision in the night.

In the LXX., to ,' instruct," "teach" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-16.htm">1 Corinthians 2:16</a>). In this verse we first remark the very important introduction of the pronoun we into the narrative, marking the presence of the historian himself, and showing that he first joined St. Paul at Tread He went with him to Philippi (ver. 12), and there he appears to have stopped till St. Paul returned there in his third missionary journey on his way from Achaia to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5, 6</a>), where we find him still with the apostle (<a href="../../par/acts/20-17.htm">Acts 20:17, 18</a>).

It is quite characteristic of Holy Scripture that things are told, or appear on the face of the narrative, without any explanation. Who Luke was, what brought him to Troas, how he became a companion of St. Paul, whether as his medical adviser or otherwise, we know not. His Christian modesty forbade his speaking about himself.

The natural way of construing the words undoubtedly is, as in the A.V., "which is the chief city of the [or, ' that'] district of Macedonia, and a colony." The only difficulty in the way of so taking it is that when AEmilius Paulus, as related by Livy (45:29), divided the conquered kingdom of Macedonia into four districts (<span class="accented">regiones</span> or <span class="accented">partes</span>), Amphi-pelts was made the capital of the district in which Philippi was situated. But the epithet <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> does not necessarily mean the capital; it is found on coins applied to cities which were not capitals. Besides, in the interval of above two hundred years between Aemilius Paulus and St. Paul (from s.c. 167 to A.D. ), it is very probable that the city of Philippi, with its gold-mines and its privileges as a colony, may have really become the capital. And so Lewin, following Wetstein, understands it (vol. it. p. 209). We know that in the reign of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia was divided into two provinces, Philippi became the ecclesiastical head of Macedonia Prima. It had been made a colony by Augustus Caesar, with the name "Col. Jul. Aug. Philip.," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Colonia Augusta Julia Philippensis ('Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). It must, therefore, anyhow have been a place of first-rate importance at this time. Those, however, who do not accept this explanation, couple <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "which is the first colony-city," etc, Others take <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span> in a local sense, "the first city you come to in Macedonia" (Conybeare and Howson, Alford, Bengel, etc.). The R.V. seems to take <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;</span>...  <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> together, and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> as a further description of it - a most awkward construction. Alford renders it, "which is the first Macedonian city of the district.' But the natural way of construing a passage is almost always the best, and nothing prevents us from believing that St. Luke, who knew Philippi intimately, was strictly accurate in calling it "the chief city of the district of Macedonia," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district in which it was situated. That <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical name of the division of a province appears from the title <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, applied by Josephus to a certain Apollonius, governor, under Antiochus Epiphanes, of the district in which Samaria was included ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 5:5). The ancient name of Philippi was Dates first, then Krenides - the springs, or wells; and the word used by Livy of the districts of Macedonia, <span class="accented">pars prima, secunda</span>, etc., is an exact translation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> It received the name of Philippi, from Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, who extracted a great revenue from its gold-mines. Its great historical celebrity arises from the battle in the plain of Philippi, in which the republican party, under Brutus and Cassius, received its death-blow from Octavius and Antony. (For a full description of Philippi, and of the privileges of a colony, see Conybeare and Howson, vol. 1:311, etc., and Lewin, vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">This</span>. Alford, following certain manuscripts, reads <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>, "in the city itself," as distinguished from the place outside the city, where the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> was. But, perhaps, St. Luke uses the word "this" from Philippi being the place of his own residence, and where he may have drawn up the narrative on the spot.

By <span class="accented">the</span> river side is the natural way of expressing it in English. The river is not the Strymon, which is a day's journey distant from Philippi, but probably a small stream called the Gangas or Gangites, which is crossed by the Via Eguatia, about a mile out of Philippi. The neighborhood of water, either near a stream or on the seashore, was usually preferred by the Jews as a place for prayer, as affording facility for ablutions (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 14:10, 23; and other passages quoted by Alford). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, should be rendered, not as in the R.V., but more nearly as the A.V., <span class="accented">where a prayer-meeting</span>(<span class="accented">of</span> the Jews) <span class="accented">was accustomed to be held</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> this particular spot was the usual place where such Jews or proselytes as happened to be at Philippi met for prayer.

So in <a href="../../par/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, the litigants go to the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, first, and he sends them on to the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, or judge, who orders them for punishment. This seems a more probable explanation than that commonly adopted (Howson, Alford, Renan, Lewin, etc.), that the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> mean the same officers.

Philippi, being a colony, was governed by Roman magistrates called duumviri, corresponding to the two consuls at Rome. But we learn from Cicero that in his time the duuraviri in the colonies were beginning to be called praetors, a little previously used only at Rome ('De Leg.

What became of Timothy we are not expressly told, only we find him at Beroea in <a href="../../par/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a> and <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a>; and at Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a>).

This was the ancient capital of that division of Macedonia (Macedonia Prima); see <a href="../../par/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note. It was situated on the Via Egnatia, thirty-four miles southwest from Philippi, and three miles from the AEgean Sea. It lay in a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by the Strymon, whence its name, <span class="accented">Amphipolis</span>; its modern name is <span class="accented">Neokhoria</span>, now a village. Its original name was <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#xa0;&#x1ffe;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, The Nine Ways. Originally a Thracian city, it was conquered by the Athenians, then by the Lacedaemonians, then fell under the dominion of Philip of Macedon, and finally, with the rest of Macedonia, became part of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">Apollonia</span>; now probably <span class="accented">Polina</span>, thirty miles due west of Amphipolis, on the Via Egnatia. The modern track from Amphipolis to <span class="cmt_word">Thessalonica</span> does not pass through Polina, but beneath it. Thessalonica; on the Via Egnatia, now the important seaport of <span class="accented">Saloniki</span>, on the Aegean Sea or Archipelago, thirty-eight miles from Apollonia, and con-raining about sixty thousand inhabitants. Its ancient name was Therma (whence the Thermean Bay), but it took the name of Thessalonica under the Macedonian kings. It continued to grow in importance under the Romans, and was the most populous city of the whole of Macedonia. It was the capital of Macedonia Secunda under the division by AEmilius Paulus (<a href="../../par/acts/16-12.htm">Acts 16:12</a>, note), and in the time of Theodosius the Younger, when Macedonia consisted of two provinces, it was the capital of Macedonia Prima. But from its situation and great commercial importance it was virtually the capital of "Greece, Macedonia, and Illyricum" (Howson, in ' Dict. of Geog.'). Its trade attracted a great colony of Jews from before the time of St. Paul, and through the Roman and Greek and Turkish empires, down to the present day, when "one-half of the population is said to be of Israelitish race "(Lewin). Thessalonica had a terrible celebrity from the massacre of its inhabitants by order of the Emperor Theodosius, in revenge for the murder of Botheric, his general, which led to the famous penance imposed upon the emperor by St. Ambrose (Gibbon,' Decline and Fall,' <a href="../../par/acts/27.htm">Acts 27</a>.). It was also taken three times in the Middle Ages: by the Saracens, with fearful slaughter, A.D. 904; by the Normans, with scarcely less cruelty, A.D. 1185; and by the Turks, in 1430. Its ecclesiastical history under its archbishops is also of great interest (see 'Dict. of Greek and Roman Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Where was a synagogue</span>. It is needless to point out the exact agreement of this brief statement with historical fact as pointed out above. There is said to have been twenty-two Jewish synagogues at Thessalonica after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in the fifteenth century, and the number at the present time is stated to be thirty-six. The existence of a synagogue at this time was the reason of St. Paul's visit and sojourn there.

The fulfillment of prophecies relating to the Messiah in the person of Jesus is like the fitting of a key to the intricate wards of the lock, which proves that it is the right key. The preacher of the gospel should carefully study and expound to the people the word of prophecy, and then show its counterpart in the sufferings and glory of Christ. This did St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">Opening</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); as our Lord had done (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="../../par/luke/24-32.htm">Luke 24:32</a>), the hidden meaning of the prophecies, and then <span class="cmt_word">alleging</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), setting before them the propositions which had thus been established.

He was a relation, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, of St. Paul's, and doubtless a Jew. <span class="accented">Jason</span> was a Romanized form of the name <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, or <span class="accented">Joshua, as</span> we see in the case of the high priest, the brother of Chins (Josephus, ' Ant.

The English phrase, "they made for the sea," is nearly equivalent. The object of going to the sea, seventeen miles from Beraea, was to take ship for Athens.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, in its primary sense, means to "place any one" in a given spot; and thence secondarily, to "conduct" or" escort" any one to a place, to "set him down" at such a place. So Homer ('Odyssey,' 13:294) uses the word of transporting any one by ship to this or that town (quoted by Meyer). There is the indication in the word of St. Paul's defect of sight or infirmity. <span class="cmt_word">Receiving a commandment</span>, etc. We learn here that St. Paul sent a message to Silas and Timothy to join him at Athens as quickly as possible, and at ver. 16 that he waited at Athens for them. From <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2</a>, we learn that he sent Timothy from Athens back to Thessalonica; and from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a> we learn that Timothy came to St. Paul at Corinth (where the Epistle to the Thessalonians was written) from Thessalonica. We also learn from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a> that Silas and Timothy were both with him at Corinth when he wrote the Epistle, and from <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> that they had both come to Corinth from Macedonia, some weeks after Paul himself had been at Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/18-4.htm">Acts 18:4, 5</a>). All these statements harmonize perfectly (as Paley has shown) on the supposition that Silas and Timothy did join St. Paul at Athens; that for the reasons given in <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3.htm">1 Thessalonians 3</a>, when he was unable to return to Thessalonica himself, as he much wished, he sent Timothy back to Thessalonica, and Silas probably to Beraea; and that Silas and Timothy came together from Macedonia to Corinth, where St. Paul had gone alone; where it may be noted, as another undesigned coincidence, that whereas the First Epistle to the Thessalonians implies that Silas did <span class="accented">not</span> go to Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a>), <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy came from <span class="accented">Thessalonica</span>, but from <span class="accented">Macedonia.</span> The inaccuracy supposed by Meyer (on this verse) is purely imaginary. <a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a> does not say that Silas and Timothy "only joined Paul at Corinth," but merely relates some change in St. Paul's procedure consequent upon their joining him at Corinth. Alford (on this verse), in saying that Paul sent Timothy from Beraea, not from Athens, is guided by his own idea of what is probable, not by the letter of the narrative (see further note on Acts 18:5).

It is (says Lewin) a bare, rugged rock, approached at the south-eastern corner by steps, of which sixteen still remain perfect. Its area at the top measures sixty paces by twenty-four, within which a quadrangle, sixteen paces square, is excavated and leveled for the court. The judges seem to have sat on benches tier above tier on the rising rock on the north side of the quadrangle. There were also seats on the east and west sides, and on the south on either side of the stairs. The Areopagus (the upper court) was the most august of all the courts at Athens. Socrates was tried and condemned before it for impiety. On the present occasion, there is no appearance of judicial proceedings, but they seem to have adjourned to the Areopagus from the Agora, as to a convenient place for quiet discussion.

Perhaps the conclusion is that St. Paul, having his spirit stirred by seeing the city full of idols, determined to attack that spirit in the Athenian people which led to so much idolatry; which he did in the speech which follows. But, acting with his usual wisdom, he used an inoffensive term at the outset of his speech. He could not mean to praise them for that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> which it was the whole object of his sermon to condemn. Josephus ('Contr. Apion.,' 1:12) calls the Athenians <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, the most religious of all Greeks (Howson).

There is no direct and explicit testimony in ancient writers to the existence of any one such altar at Athens, but Pausanias and others speak of altars to "unknown gods," as to be seen in Athens, which may well be understood of several such altars, each dedicated to an unknown god. One of these was seen by St. Paul, and, with inimitable tact, made the text of his sermon. He was not preaching a foreign god to them, but making known to them one whom they had already included in their devotions without knowing him.

It is frequent in the LXX. It is a striking instance of St. Paul's unflinching boldness and fidelity to the truth, that he should expose the hollowness of heathen worship, standing within a stone's throw of the Parthenon and the temple of Theseus and the countless other temples of gods and goddesses, which were the pride and glory of the Athenian people. Note how he begins his catechetical instruction to the Athenians with the first article of the Creed: "I believe in God the Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth."

The teaching, therefore, of the passage is that, though God was very near to every man, and had not left himself without abundant witness in his manifold gifts, yet, through the blindness of the heathen, they had to feel their way uncertainly toward God. In this fact lies the need of a revelation, as it follows ver. 30, etc. And hence part at least of the significance of such passages as, "Ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-8.htm">Ephesians 5:8</a>); "Who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a> ); "God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>), and many more like passages.

The earliest notice we have of him in ecclesiastical writers is the well-known one of Eusebius, 'Eccl.

Eusebius repeats the statement in his long notice of Dionysius of Corinth, in 4. 23. Other uncertain traditions speak of him (Suidas) as one who rose to the height of Greek erudition, and as having suffered a cruel martyrdom (Niceph., 3:11). "The works which go by his name are undoubtedly spurious" (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Damaris</span>; "wholly unknown" (Meyer), but certainly not the wife of Dionysius, as Chrysostom (' De Sacerd.,' 4:7) and others have thought ('Dictionary of the Bible'). <span class="cmt_word">And others with them</span>. These would seem to be but few from St. Luke's way of mentioning them, and from our hearing nothing more in the Acts about the Church at Athens. It is remarkable that this small number of converts coincides with the weakness of the synagogue at Athens - too weak to persecute, and too weak to make proselytes among the Greeks of Athens. It scorns clear that nowhere else had St. Paul won so few souls to Christ. And yet God's Word did not return to him wholly void. The seed fell on some good ground, to bring forth fruit unto eternal life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/16.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 16"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 16" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/18.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 18"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 18" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/acts/18.htm"><title>Acts 18 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/acts/18.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/acts/18.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/acts/18-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../acts/17.htm" title="Acts 17">&#9668;</a> Acts 18 <a href="../acts/19.htm" title="Acts 19">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a></div><div class="verse">After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- He</span> for <span class="accented">Paul</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">After these things</span>, etc. No hint is given by St. Luke as to the length of Paul's sojourn at Athens. But as the double journey of the Beroeans, who accompanied him to Athens, back to Beraea, and of Timothy from Beraea to Athens, amounted to above five hundred miles (Lewin, p. 268), we cannot suppose it to have been less than a month; and it may have been a good deal more. His reasonings in the synagogue with the Jews and devout Greeks, apparently on successive sabbaths, his daily disputations in the Agora, apparently not begun till after he had "waited" some time for Silas and Timothy, the knowledge he had acquired of the numerous temples and altars at Athens, and the phrase with which this chapter begins, all indicate a stay of some length. <span class="cmt_word">Came to Corinth</span>. If by land, a forty miles' or two days' journey, through Eleusis and Megara; if by sea, a day's sail. Lewin thinks he came by sea, and that it was in winter, and that possibly one of the shipwrecks mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a> may have occurred at this time. <span class="accented">Corinth</span>, at this time a Roman colony, the capital of the province of Achaia, and the residence of the proconsul.

Ancient Corinth had been destroyed by Mummins, surnamed Achaicus, R.C. 146, and remained waste (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;</span>) many years. Julius Caesar founded a Roman colony on the old site (Howson), "consisting principally of freedmen, among whom were great numbers of the Jewish race." Corinth, as a Roman colony, had its duumviri, as appears by coins of the reign of Claudius (Lewin, p. 270.

Whether the Jewish family residing in Pontus took the name of Aquila from any of these Romans is not known. Aquila, the translator of the Old Testament into Greek about A.D. , was also a Jew of Pontus, the old kingdom of Mithridates. That there was a considerable colony of Jews in Pontus appears also from <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a> and <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Priscilla</span>.

Prisca is a not uncommon name for Roman women. The masculine Priscus occurs very frequently. Aquila and Priscilla were among the most active Christians, and the most devoted friends of St. Paul (vers. 18, 26; <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>); and were evidently persons of culture as well as piety.

But it occurs in the LXX. of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>, and in the apocryphal books repeatedly, and in Polybius. The adjective <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is also used by the LXX. and the Apocrypha and in classical Greek for "new," is used only once in the New Testament, in <a href="../../par/hebrews/10-20.htm">Hebrews 10:20</a>. It means properly "newly killed," hence anything "recent," "fresh, or "new." Both the adjective and the adverb are very common in medical writings. <span class="cmt_word">Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome</span>. Suetonius mentions the fact, but unfortunately does not say in what year of Claudius's reign it took place. His account is that, in consequence of frequent disturbances and riots among the Jews at the instigation of Chrestus, Claudius drove them from Rome. It seems almost certain, as Renan says, especially combining Tacitus's account ('Annal.,' 15:44) of the spread of Christianity in the city of Rome before the time of Nero, that <span class="accented">Chrestus</span> (Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>,) is only a corruption of the name Christ, similar to that found on three or four inscriptions before the time of Constantine, where Christians are called <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>, and to the formation of the French word <span class="accented">Chretien</span> - in old French <span class="accented">Chrestien</span>; and that the true account of these riots is that they were attacks of the unbelieving Jews upon Christian Jews, similar to these at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/8.htm">Acts 8</a>.), at Antioch in Pisidia (<a href="../../par/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>), at Iconium and Lystra (<a href="../../par/acts/14.htm">Acts 14</a>.), and at Thessalonica and Beraea (<a href="../../par/acts/17.htm">Acts 17</a>.). The Romans did not discriminate between Jews and Christian Jews, and thought that those who called Christ their King were fighting under his leadership (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>; see Renan, 'St. Paul,' p. 101). Tertullian and Lactantius (quoted by Lewin, p. 274) both speak of the vulgar pronunciation, Chres-<span class="accented">tianus</span> and <span class="accented">Chrestus.</span> Howson also adopts the above explanation. But Meyer thinks that Chrestus was, as Suetonius says, a Jewish leader of insurrection at Rome. The question bears on the passage before us chiefly as the solution does or does not prove the existence of Christians at Rome at this time, and affects the probability of Aquila and Priscilla being already Christians when they came to Corinth, before they made St. Paul's acquaintance.

Now they both come to Corinth from <span class="accented">Macedonia</span>, which includes Beraea and Thessalonica.

St. Luke has not infrequently a use of words peculiar to himself. The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">instabat verbo</span>, seems so to understand it. It was probably soon after the arrival of Silas and Timothy that St. Paul wrote his First Epistle to the Thessalonians (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1, 2, 6</a>).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a></div><div class="verse">And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> <span class="accented">- But</span> for <span class="accented">and</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">proconsul</span> for <span class="accented">the deputy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">with one accord rose</span> up for <span class="accented">made insurrection with one accord</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">to</span>, A.V. Gallio. Marcus Annaeus Novatus took the name of Lucius Junius Annaeus Gallio, on account of his adoption by L. Junius Gallio. He was the elder brother of Seneca, and a man of ability, and of a most amiable temper and disposition. His brother Seneca said that he had not a fault, and that everybody loved him. He was called "Dulcis Gallio" by Statius. It is unfortunately not known exactly in what year Gallio became either Consul or Proconsul of Achaia. Had it been known, it would have been invaluable for fixing the chronology of St. Paul's life. Lewin puts it (his proconsulate) in the year A.D. , and so does Renan; Howson, between A.D.  and A.D. . The circumstantial evidence from secular writers corroborating St. Luke's account is exceedingly curious. There is no account extant either of his consulate or of his proconsulate of Achaia. But Pithy, speaking of the medicinal effect of a sea-voyage on persons in consumption, gives as an example, "as I remember was the case with Annaeus Gallio after his consulate," and seems to imply that he went to Egypt for the sake of the long sea-voyage; which would suit very well his going there from his government in Achaia (Pliny, 'Nat. Hist.,' 31. cap. 6:33). And that his proconsulate was in Achaia is corroborated by a chance quotation in Seneca's Epistle 104, of a saying of "my lord Gallio, when ha had a fever <span class="accented">in Achaia</span> and immediately went on board ship," where the phrase "domini met," applied to his own brother, seems also to indicate his high rank. Profane history also shuts up the probable date of Gallio's proconsulate between the year A.D.  and the year A.D.  or 66, in which he died. There is a diversity of accounts as to his death. Ernesti, in his note on Tacitus, 'Auual.,' 15. 73, where Tacitus speaks of him as frightened at the death of his brother Seneca, and a suppliant for his own life, says, "quem Nero post interfecit," and refers to Dion Cassius, 58,18, and Eusebius. But Dion is there speaking of Junius Gallio in the reign of Tiberius, not of our Gallio at all; though afterwards, speaking of the death of Seneca, he says, "and his brothers also were killed after him "(62, 25). As for Eusebius, the passage quoted is not found in the Greek or Armenian copies of the 'Chronicon,' but only in the Latin of Jerome. But, as Scaliger points out, there is a manifest blunder here, because the 'Chronicon ' places the death of Gallio two years before that of Seneca, whereas we know from Tacitus that Gallio was alive after his brother's death. Moreover, the description "egregius declamator" clearly applies to Junius Gallio the rhetorician, and not to Gallio his adopted son. Though, therefore, Renan says, "Comme son frere il eut l'honneur sous Neron d'expier par, la mort sa distinction et son honnetete" ('St. Paul,' p. 222), if we give duo weight to the silence of Tacitus, it is very doubtful whether he died a violent death at all. St. Luke, as usual, is most accurate in calling him proconsul. Achaia had been recently made a senatorial province by Claudius.

It is used in the same sense in Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 11. 8:6). In a metaphorical sense it means" to renounce," "to bid adieu to" (<a href="../../par/luke/14-23.htm">Luke 14:23</a>). Of the six times it occurs in the New Testament, four are in St. Luke's writings and one in St. Paul's. <span class="cmt_word">With him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchreae</span>, etc. There is great diversity of opinion as to whether it was St. Paul or Aquila who had the vow. Meyer thinks that the mention of Priscilla before Aquila, contrary to the order in ver. 2 and in ver. 26 (where, however, the R.T. reads "<span class="accented">Priscilla</span> and <span class="accented">Aquila</span>), is a clear indication that Luke meant the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., to refer to Aquila, not to St. Paul, and Howson takes the same view. But this is a very weak argument, refuted at once by <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a> and <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-19.htm">2 Timothy 4:19</a>, as well as by the whole run of the passage, in which Paul is throughout the person spoken of; or, as Alford puts it, in the consecutive narrative from ver. 18 to ver. 25, there are <span class="accented">nine</span> aorist participles, of which eight apply to Paul, as the subject of the section, making it scarcely doubtful that the ninth applies to him likewise. Moreover, there is no conceivable reason why the vow should be mentioned if it was taken by Aquila, and, what is still more conclusive, the person who went to Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Paul, must be the one who had the vow, not the person who stayed behind, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Aquila. In fact, nobody would ever have thought of making Aquila the subject if it were not for the thought that there is an incongruity with Paul's character in his making a vow of that kind. But we must take what we find in Scripture, and not force it to speak our own thoughts. As regards the nature of the vow, it is not quite clear what it was. It was not the simple Nazaritic vow described in <a href="../../par/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18-21</a>; nor is the word here used by St. Luke (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) the one which is there and elsewhere employed by the LXX., and by St. Luke himself in <a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>, of that final shaving of the hair of the Nazarite for the purpose of offering it at the door of the tabernacle (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span>). It seems rather to have been of the nature of that vow which Josephus speaks of as customary for persons in any affliction, viz. to make a vow that, for thirty days previous to that on which they intend to offer sacrifice, they will abstain from wine and will shave off (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) their hair, adding that Bernice was now at Jerusalem in order to perform such a vow ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 15:1). But it further appears, from certain passages in the Mishna, that, if any one had a Nazarite vow upon him outside the limits of the Holy Land, he could not fulfill such vow till he was come to the Holy Laud, to Jerusalem; but it was allowable in such case to cut his hair short (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and as some say to take it with him to Jerusalem, and there offer it at the same time that he offered his sacrifice and shaved his head (<span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). It would seem, therefore, that either in a severe illness or under some great danger (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>) St. Paul had made such a vow; that he had been unwilling to cut his hair short at Corinth, where he was thrown so much into the society of Greeks, and therefore did so at Cenchreae just before he embarked for Syria; and that he made all haste to reach Jerusalem in time for the Passover, that he might there accomplish his vow (see Bishop Wordsworth's note on Acts 18:18; and Farrar's ' Life of St. Paul,' 2. p. 2). His motives for the vow may have been partly those described on another occasion (<a href="../../par/acts/21-24.htm">Acts 21:24</a>), and partly his own Jewish feelings of piety showing themselves in the accustomed way. <span class="cmt_word">Cenchreae</span>.

As regards the expression, <span class="cmt_word">left them there</span>, it probably arises from some actual detail which made it the natural one to use. If, for example, the synagogue was just outside the city, and Paul, parting with Aquila and Priscilla in the city, had gone off immediately to the synagogue, the phrase used would be the natural one; or the words, "he left them there," may be spoken with reference to the main narrative, which is momentarily interrupted by the mention of St. Paul's visit to the synagogue. Note the extreme importance of this brief visit to Ephesus, where the foundation of a vigorous and flourishing Church seems to have been laid. He who knows "the times and the seasons" sent St. Paul there now, though two years before he had forbidden him to go to Asia.

It is certainly difficult to account for such words being inserted in the text if they were not genuine; whereas it is easy to account for their omission, either by accident or from the fact that the brevity of the allusion to his visit to Jerusalem in ver. 22 might easily mislead a copyist into thinking that St. Paul did not go to Jerusalem at this time, and therefore that the words were misplaced. Observe how St. Paul's fixed purpose to reach Jerusalem as soon as possible tallies with the account of his vow. <span class="cmt_word">This feast</span> (A.V.). It is not clear what feast is meant. Alford, Wordsworth, ' Speaker's Commentary,' and others, following Wieseler, think it was the Feast of Pentecost, being influenced by the consideration that sailing was dangerous and very unusual so early as before the Passover.

It is a remarkable example of St. Luke's great brevity at times that this is the only notice of his arrival at Jerusalem, where his vow was to be fulfilled. <span class="cmt_word">Went down to Antioch</span>; from whence he had started with Silas, after his separation from Barnabas, some three years before, "being recommended by the brethren to the grace of God" (<a href="../../par/acts/16-40.htm">Acts 16:40</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/acts/14-26.htm">Acts 14:26, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30</a>).

According to Renan, Lewin, 'Speaker's Commentary,' and many others, it was at this time that the meeting with St. Peter occurred to which St. Paul refers in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>, etc. And Renan ingeniously connects that perversion of the faith of the Galatians which led to St. Paul's Epistle being addressed to them, with the visit to Antioch of James's emissaries, Lewin also identifies the journey of St Paul to Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="../../par/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a> with that recorded in our ver. 22. But neither of these theories is borne out by any known facts, nor is in itself probable. There is no appearance of Barnabas or Titus being with St. Paul at this time, and it is very unlikely that any should have come from James to Antioch so immediately after St. Paul's salutation of the Church at Jerusalem and the fulfillment of his vow there. The time preceding the visit of Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, as related in <a href="../../par/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>, is far the most likely for the encounter of the two apostles (see <a href="../../par/acts/14-28.htm">Acts 14:28</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, and note). <span class="cmt_word">Went through</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The region of Galatia and Phrygia</span>. In <a href="../../par/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a> the order is inverted, "the region of Phrygia and Galatia," R.V., or "Phrygia and the region of Galatia," A.V. The natural inference from this is, as Lewin says, with whom Farrar agrees, that on this occasion St. Paul went straight from Antioch to Galatia, passing through the Cilician Gates and by Mazaca, or Caesarea, as it was called by Tiberius Caesar, in Cappadocia, and not visiting the Churches of Lycaonia. He proceeded from Galatia through Phrygia to Ephesus. The distance from Antioch to Tarsus was one hundred and forty-one miles, from whence to Tavium in Galatia was two hundred and seventy-one miles, making the whole distance from Antioch to Tavium in Galatia four hundred and twelve miles, or about a three weeks' journey including rest on the sabbath days. From Galatia to Ephesus would be between six hundred and seven hundred miles. The entire journey would thus be considerably more than a thousand miles, a journey of forty days exclusive of all stoppages. Six months probably must have elapsed between his departure from Antioch and his arrival at Ephesus; Lewin says "several months" (p. 330, note). <span class="cmt_word">In order</span>; in the same order, though inverted, in which he had first visited them, leaving out none. <span class="cmt_word">Stablishing</span>, etc. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); see above, <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32, 41</a>.

From ver. 24 to ver. 28 is a distinct episode, and an important one, as containing the first mention of a very remarkable man, Apollos (a short form of <span class="accented">Apollonius</span>, like Epaphras for <span class="accented">Epaphroditus</span>) of Alexandria, a city destined to play a conspicuous part in Church history, as the traditional Church and see of St. Mark, the school of the Neoplatonists, the scene of the labors of Origen, Clement, and many other men of note, and the birthplace of the Gnostic leaders Cerinthus, Basilides, and Valentinus. The notices of Apollos in the New Testament are <a href="../../par/acts/19-1.htm">Acts 19:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4, 5, 6, 22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-6.htm">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; and all show St. Paul's high esteem for him.

It is difficult at first sight to conceive how at this time any one could know the baptism of John without knowing further that of Christ. But a possible account of it is that Apollos living at Alexandria, where as yet there was no Christian Church. had met some Jews who had been in Judaea at the time of John's ministry, and had heard from them of John's baptism and preaching, and of his testimony to Jesus as the Messiah, but had had no further opportunity of careful instruction in the faith of Jesus Christ till he happened to come to Ephesus and make the acquaintance of his compatriots, Aquila and Priscilla. They hearing him speak with fervor and eloquence, but perceiving that his knowledge was imperfect, immediately invited him to their house, and instructed him in the fullness of the truth of the gospel. This necessarily included the doctrine of Christian baptism, which we cannot doubt was administered to him (<a href="../../par/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>).

Nothing can be more natural than the course of events here described. In his intimate intercourse with Priscilla and Aquila, Apollos had necessarily heard much of the great work at Corinth, and the flourishing Church there; and so he longed to see for himself and to exercise his powers in watering what St. Paul had so well planted (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-6.htm">1 Corinthians 3:6</a>). Priscilla and Aquila having heard his eloquent sermons at Ephesus, and being interested in the Corinthian Church, seem to have encouraged him, and to have joined with the other disciples at Ephesus in giving him commendatory letters to the Church of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">Encouraged him</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, a word found nowhere else in the New Testament, but used in classical Greek and in the Apocrypha, in the sense of "exhorting," "urging." <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> are hortatory words.

There is a difference of opinion among commentators whether the exhortation was addressed to Apollos, as the R.V. takes it, or to the brethren at Corinth, as the A.V. understands it. It seems rather more consonant to the structure of the sentence and to the probability of the case that the exhortation was addressed to the Corinthian Church, and not to Apollos, who needed no such encouragement, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is equivalent to "wrote and exhorted."

It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>).

The R.V. gives the sense much more accurately than the A.V., which is, "Did ye receive the Holy Ghost at the time of your baptism, when ye first believed?" Something led the apostle to suspect that they had not received the seal of the Spirit (comp. <a href="../../par/ephesians/1-13.htm">Ephesians 1:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>), and so he asked the question. The answer, <span class="cmt_word">Nay, we did, not so much as hear whether the Holy Ghost was given</span>, as in the R.V., is justified by <a href="../../par/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a>, where the exactly similar phrase, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f54;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f0d;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, is rendered in the A.V., "The Holy Spirit was not yet given." "<span class="accented">Esse</span> pro <span class="accented">adesse"</span> (Bengel). The sense given in the A.V. does not seem probable.

We learn also from Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 8:2, 5, that forms of exorcism, said to have been invented by King Solomon, so efficacious that the devils cast out by them could never come back, were used with great effect in his days. He adds that he himself knew of an instance in which one of his own countrymen, Eleazar by name, had cast out devils in the presence of Vespasian and his <span class="accented">sons</span> and officers and a number of his soldiers. The method used was this: The exorcist applied to the nose of the possessed the bezil of a ring, under which was a certain root prescribed by Solomon, and so drew out the evil spirit through the man's nostrils. The possessed then fell to the ground, and the exorcist commanded the evil spirit in the name of Solomon never to return, and then recited one of Solomon's incantations. To give full assurance to the bystanders that the evil spirit had really left the man, the exorcist placed a vessel full of water at some distance off, and then commanded the ejected spirit to overturn it, which he did. Thus far Josephus. Lightfoot, on <a href="../../par/acts/13.htm">Acts 13</a>. (vol. 3:215), quotes the book Juchasin as speaking of certain Jews as "skilled in miracles," and the Jerusalem Talmud as speaking of their enchantments and magical tricks and charms" in the name of Jesus" (see, further, Alford on <a href="../../par/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>).

Comp. <a href="../../par/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11-14</a>, where the same effects are ascribed to the death of Ananias and Sapphire and the signs and wonders which were wrought by the apostles at that time. This fear produced by the putting forth of God's power paralyzed for a time the enemies of the gospel, and enabled believers, as it were, to take possession of their new heritage, just as the miracles at the Red Sea and the destruction of Sihon and Og paralyzed the courage of the Canaanites and enabled the Israelites to take possession of their land (<a href="../../par/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). With respect to the incident which caused this fear, it might at first seem inconsistent with our Lord's saying to the apostles (<a href="../../par/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49, 50</a>). But the cases were very different. He who cast out devils in the name of Jesus, in the Gospel, does not seem to have had any hostility to the faith, for our Lord speaks of him as one who "is not against us." But these sons of Sceva were among the unbelieving Jews who were "hardened and disobedient;" and if their exorcisms had been permitted to succeed, they would have had power to withstand Paul, as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and the very purpose for which miraculous power was given to St. Paul would have been frustrated. There- fore they were discomfited, and the subtle design of Satan to destroy, while seeming to magnify, the Name of Jesus was signally defeated. Comp. the somewhat similar incident at Philippi (<a href="../../par/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16-18</a>). Justin Martyr, in his 'Diologue with Trypho,' quoted by Alford on <a href="../../par/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>, speaks of the Jews as exorcising, sometimes in the name of kings (referring, doubtless, to Solomon), sometimes of just men, or of prophets, or of patriarchs. So these men took up the name of Jesus.

This and the following verse speak of that class of converts who had previously been addicted to magic arts.

Hesychius gives as the names of the oldest Ephesian charms, Aski, Kataski, Lix, Petrax, Damnameneus, AEsion, which he explains as meaning severally "Darkness, Light," "the Earth," "the Year," "the Truth" (Lewin, p. 334).

There is a difference of opinion as to what coin or weight is meant. If Greek coinage, which is perhaps natural in a Greek city, fifty thousand drachmae of silver would be meant, equal to &pound;1875, If Jewish shekels are meant, the sum would amount to &pound;7000 ('Speaker's Commentary').

It marks the unrivalled tenderness of his heart toward the disciples. Observe also the insatiable appetite of the apostle for spiritual conquests, and his noble contempt for idleness. He has but just won Ephesus and Asia, and already he undertakes Macedonia and Achaia. Nor does his mind stop there, but reaches on to Jerusalem, then stretches onwards to Rome, and meditates the invasion of Spain.

Silos, who had been Timothy's companion on the former visit to Macedonia, seems to have left St. Paul, possibly at Jerusalem, from whence he originally came (<a href="../../par/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32, 34</a>), and to have attached himself to Peter (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Perhaps he was especially connected with the mission to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, etc., as it appears from the passage just quoted that he was "a faithful brother unto them," A.V.; "or our faithful brother," R.V. <span class="cmt_word">He himself stayed</span>, etc. This phrase is in singular harmony with <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8</a>, which seems clearly to have been written after Timothy's departure for Macedonia and before his arrival at Corinth, since Timothy is not mentioned either in the superscription or among the salutations (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-1.htm">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19, 20</a>), and his coming to Corinth is spoken of as doubtful, though probable, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. Both passages imply a prolongation of Paul's stay at Ephesus beyond his original intention. The special reason for this prolongation of his sojourn at Ephesus, and which is alluded to in 1 Car 16:9, is thought to be the Artemisian or Ephesian games, which were celebrated at Ephesus in May - and therefore just at this time - and which brought a vast concourse of Ionians to Ephesus. It was at this time, doubtless, that the principal sale of "silver shrines of Diana" took place, and therefore it was natural that Demetrius and his fellow-craftsmen should be very angry when they found their usual gains were cut short by the multitude of converts all over Proconsular Asia. We learn from <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a> that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus had arrived at Ephesus from Corinth. It is likely that their presence, together with that of Tychicus and Trophimus, two Asiatic converts, enabled St. Paul to dispense with the services of Time-thy and Erastus for a time. <span class="greek">&#x1f1c;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, kept himself back, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> stayed; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a while, an indefinite phrase, but indicating a short time.

The common place of resort for all great meetings. So Tacitus, 'Hist.,' 2:80 (quoted by Alford), says that at Antioch the people were wont to hold their public debates in the theatre, and that a crowded meeting was held there to forward the interests of Vespasian, then aspiring to the empire. So Josephus speaks of the people of Antioch holding a public assembly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in the theatre ('Bell. Jud.,' 7. 3:3). The people of the Greek city of Tarentum received the ambassadors from Rome in the theatre, "according to the Greek custom," Val. Max., 2:2, 5 (Kuinoel, on <a href="../../par/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>). The theatre at Ephesus, of which "ruins of immense grandeur" still remain, is said to be the largest of which we have any account (Howson, 2. p. 68). <span class="cmt_word">Having seized</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); a favorite word with Luke(<a href="../../par/acts/6-12.htm">Acts 6:12</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/27-12.htm">Acts 27:12</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-29.htm">Luke 8:29</a>); and found also in the LXX, of <a href="../../par/proverbs/6-25.htm">Proverbs 6:25</a>; 2 Macc. 3:27 2Macc. 4:41; but not elsewhere in the New Testament. It is a common medical word of sudden seizures. The force of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span> is that they hurried Gaius and Aristarchus along with them to the theatre, no doubt intending there to accuse them to the people. <span class="cmt_word">Gaius and Aristarchus</span>. In <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> there is mention of a certain <span class="accented">Gains</span> who was one of Paul's companions in travel, but who is described as "of Derbe." Again in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14</a> a Gains is mentioned as one of St. Paul's converts on his first visit to Corinth, whom he baptized himself; and in <a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a> (written from Corinth) we have mention of Gains as St. Paul's host, and of the whole Church, likely, therefore, to be the same person. Then we have the Gains to whom St. John's Third Epistle is addressed, and whose hospitality to the brethren was a conspicuous feature in his character, and one tending to identify him with the Gaius of <a href="../../par/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>. We seem, therefore, to have, in immediate connection with St, Paul, Gaius of Corinth, Gains of Macedonia, and Gains of Derbe. But Gaius (or Caius, as it is written in Latin) was such a common name, and the Jews so often shifted their residence from one city to another, that it is not safe either to infer identity from identity of name, or diversity from diversity of description. <span class="accented">Aristarchus</span>, here described as of <span class="cmt_word">Macedonia</span>, is more precisely spoken of in <a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a> as a Thessalonian. In <a href="../../par/acts/27-2.htm">Acts 27:2</a>, where we find him accompanying St. Paul from Caesarea to Rome, he is described as "a Macedonian of Thessalonica." In <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> he is St. Paul's "fellow-prisoner,' as voluntarily sharing his prison (Alford, on <a href="../../par/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>), and in <a href="../../par/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a> he is his fellow-laborer. His history, therefore, is that, having been converted on St Paul's visit to Thessalonica, he attached himself to him as one of his missionary staff, and continued with him through good report and evil report, through persecution, violence, imprisonment, shipwreck, and bonds, to the latest moment on which the light of Bible history shines. Blessed servant of Christ! blessed fellow-servant of his chief apostle!

It seems likely that, as St. Paul's offence was speaking against the gods and their temples, the Jews, who were commonly accused of being atheists, and one of whose nation Paul was, came in for their share of the popular odium. They were anxious, therefore, to excuse themselves before the people of having had any share in St. Paul's work, and put forward Alexander, no doubt a clever man and a good speaker, to make their defense. But as soon as the people knew that he was a Jew, they refused to listen to him, and drowned his voice with incessant shouts of "Great is Diana of the Ephesians."

Some extant coins exhibit the city of Ephesus as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> both of Diana and the emperor (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 411; Howson, vol. it. pp. 75, 76). <span class="cmt_word">The image which fell down from Jupiter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the 'Iphig. in Taur.,' 947), <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; which is described in ver. 88 of the same play as "the image (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the goddess Diana, which they say fell down from heaven (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) into her temple in Tauris;" and in line 1349 it is called <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> image of the daughter of Jove which fell from heaven," brought away from Tauris by Iphigenia and Orestes into Attica. But it does not appear that there was any tradition that the identical image brought from Tauris was carried to Ephesus. There are several representations of the Ephesian Diana, or Artemis, on coins, of which one or two are given by Lewin (vol. 1. p, 411) and by Howson (vol. it. p. 66). The image was of rude form and execution, mummy-shaped, or like an inverted pyramid; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> (rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">multi-mammia</span>, and explained as intending to represent her as the nourisher of all living things: Preface to Ephesians); made of wood variously described as ebony, cedar, and vine wood. Pliny says that, though the temple itself had been restored seven times, the image had never been altered (quoted by Kuinoel).

It appears also that St. Paul had not launched out into abuse of the heathen gods in general, or Diana in particular, but had preached the more excellent way by faith in Jesus Christ, to draw them from their idols (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>).

Others have other explanations.

But "<span class="accented">it"</span> must mean "the riot," which is feminine, whereas <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;</span> is masculine; so that the R.T. is impossible to construe. It is much better, therefore, to adhere to the T.R., which has good manuscript authority, and to construe as the A.V. <span class="accented">Whereby</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">on</span> the ground of which" (Meyer). With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies" who comforteth us in all our tribulation." He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-10</a>). And the same tone breaks out again in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in <a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before Easter of the year  So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three <span class="accented">years</span> residence at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, with reference to his then coming visit, "I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you." It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 19</a>). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>

The omission of the title "most excellent," given to Theophilus in the Gospel (<a href="../../par/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3</a>), is one among other indications that the publication of the Acts followed very closely upon that of the Gospel. Began both to do and to teach Some take the phrase as equivalent to <span class="accented">did</span> <span class="accented">and taught</span>; <span class="accented">o</span>thers supply the sense <span class="accented">and continued</span> until the day, etc.; or, which is the same thing, supply the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, making the whole sense equivalent to "all that Jesus did and taught from the beginning until the day," etc.; others again, as Bishop Wordsworth, gather St. Luke's meaning to be that in the Acts he is about to narrate the <span class="accented">continuance</span> by our Lord in heaven of the work which he only <span class="accented">began</span> on earth. Meyer thinks that, by the insertion of the word "began," the thing said or done "is in a vivid and graphic manner denoted according to its moment of commencement;" so that our Lord is represented as at one time actively beginning to heal, then to teach, then to walk on the sea, and so on. But the words "began" and "until the day" certainly suggest the beginning and the ending of our Lord's ministry, or rather the whole ministry from its beginning to its end, so that the meaning would be "of all that Jesus did and taught from first to last." To do and to teach. So the disciples on the way to Emmaus speak of Jesus as "a Prophet mighty in deed and word" (<a href="../../par/luke/24-19.htm">Luke 24:19</a>).

In the Septuagint of <a href="../../par/1_kings/8-8.htm">1 Kings 8:8</a> it is used of the staves of the ark within the veil, which "were not seen without." The idea intended to be conveyed, both by the use of this verb and by the use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> (by the space of), is that our Lord was not with the apostles always, as he was before the Resurrection, but that he came and again disappeared (St. Chrysostom).

The nearly related substantive, <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, means "a vision," and is frequently used by St. <a href="../../par/luke/1-22.htm">Luke 1:22</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/24-23.htm">Luke 24:23</a>; 26:19.

(See <a href="../../par/luke/24-49.htm">Luke 24:49</a>.)

St. Peter refers to this saying of the Lord's in his address to the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/11-16.htm">Acts 11:16</a>), and the record of it here may be an indication that St. Luke derived his information of these early events from Peter. A curious question arises as to the baptism of the apostles themselves. When were they baptized, and by whom? Chrysostom says, "They were baptized by John." But it is evident, from <a href="../../par/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="../../par/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, that converts were baptized with Christian, as distinct from John's, baptism in our Lord's lifetime, and hence it may seem probable, especially considering that St. Paul was baptized, that the apostles may have been baptized by Christ (Bishop Wordsworth On <a href="../../par/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>). If so, the baptism with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was the complement of that baptism, not the substitute for it. "In our case," says Chrysostom, "both (the baptism of water and of the Spirit) take place under one act, but then they were divided." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">They</span> <span class="accented">therefore, when</span> for <span class="accented">when they therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">him</span> for <span class="accented">of him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">dost thou</span> for <span class="accented">wilt thou</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">restore</span> for restore <span class="accented">again</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Dost thou at this time</span>, etc.?

But allusions to the Ascension are frequent (<a href="../../par/mark/16-19.htm">Mark 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/john/6-62.htm">John 6:62</a>; <a href="../../par/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/8-34.htm">Romans 8:34</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-8.htm">Ephesians 4:8, 9</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_peter/3-22.htm">1 Peter 3:22</a>, etc.). With reference to Zeller's assertion, that in St. <span class="accented">Luke's</span> Gospel the Ascension is represented as taking place on the day of the Resurrection, it may freely be admitted that the narrative in the Gospel does not mark distinctly the interval of time between the different appearances and discourses of our Lord from the day of the Resurrection to that of the Ascension. It seems to group them according to their logical connection rather than according to their chronological sequence, and to be a general account of what Jesus said between the Resurrection and the Ascension. But there is nothing whatever in the text of St. Luke to indicate that what is related in the section Luke 24:44-49 took place at the same time as the things related in the preceding verses. And when we compare with that section what is contained in <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it becomes clear that it did not. Because the words "assembling together with them," in ver. 4, clearly indicate a different occasion from the apparitions on the day of the Resurrection; and as the words in <a href="../../par/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44-49</a> correspond with those in <a href="../../par/acts/1-4.htm">Acts 1:4, 5</a>, it must have been also on a different occasion that they were spoken. Again, the narrative of St. John, both in the twentieth and the twenty-first chapters, as well as that of <a href="../../par/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>, precludes the possibility of the Ascension having taken place, or having been thought to have taken place, on the day of the Resurrection, or for many days after, so that to force a meaning upon the last chapter of St. Luke's Gospel which it does not necessarily bear, and which places it at variance with St. Luke's own account in the Acts (Acts 1:3; 13:31), and with the Church traditions as preserved by St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. John, is a violent and willful transaction.

Where they were abiding. A slight change in the order of the words, as adopted in the text of the R.V., makes Peter and the other apostles the nominative case to the verb "went up," instead of, as in the A.V., to "abode." In regard to the list of the apostles which follows, it may be noticed first, that it is identical with that of <a href="../../par/luke/6-14.htm">Luke 6:14-16</a>, except in the omission of Judas Iscariot and the order in which the apostles are named. The order in Luke seems to have followed that of natural birth and association. The brothers, Peter and Andrew, James and John, are classed together; Philip and Bartholomew, or Nathanael, go together, and so on. But in this list John follows Peter, his close companion in missionary work (<a href="../../par/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>, etc.; Acts 4:12; 8:14); James follows instead of preceding John; and others are classed somewhat differently, for reasons probably analogous, but which we know not. Of the other lists that in <a href="../../par/mark/3-16.htm">Mark 3:16-19</a> agrees most nearly with that before us. In all, Simon Peter stands <span class="accented">first.</span> The Jude of <a href="../../par/luke/6-16.htm">Luke 6:16</a> (comp. <a href="../../par/jude/1-1.htm">Jude 1:1</a>) and <a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a> is called <span class="accented">Thaddaeus</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/10-3.htm">Matthew 10:3</a> (" Lebbaeus whose surname was Thaddaeus," A.V.) and in <a href="../../par/mark/3-18.htm">Mark 3:18</a>; but no doubt the persons are the same. In all the lists Philip stands fifth. In three Bartholomew is sixth, while in the list in Acts his being named after Thomas makes him seventh. In all the lists James the son of Alphaeus is ninth, and Judas Iscariot the last, except in the Acts, where he is not named, being already dead.

This is not the place to enter upon the difficult question of their parentage. But it may suffice to say that if James and Judas are the two apostles of that name (which Alford, however, thinks they certainly were not, referring- to <a href="../../par/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>, compared with John 6:67), then the brethren here spoken of as distinct from the apostles would be Joses and Simon.

It is most important to our Christian integrity that we should view the Scriptures in the same light as our Lord and his apostles did, as containing real prophecies, spoken by the Holy Ghost. (Compare the manner in which the sixty-ninth psalm is here quoted with that of <a href="../../par/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7</a>.) So the Creed, "I believe in the Holy Ghost .... who spake by the prophets" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/4-25.htm">Acts 4:25</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/28-25.htm">Acts 28:25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who was guide</span>, etc. If St. Peter had only been addressing his brother apostles, who were well acquainted with the treachery of Judas, it would scarcely have been natural to introduce these words; they would have seemed rather to be explanatory words added by the historian.

Again, St. Matthew explains the name <span class="accented">Akel-dama as</span> being given to the field because it was the price of the "innocent blood" of Jesus betrayed by Judas, whereas St. Luke's account rather suggests that it was Judas's own blood shed in his fall which gave the name. But both accounts of the name might be true, some understanding the name in one sense and some in the other. (Compare the different accounts of the name of Beer-sheba in <a href="../../par/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31</a> and Genesis 26:32, 33; of the origin of the proverb, "Is Saul among the prophets?" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11, 12</a> and 1 Sam 20:24; and other similar cases.)

This definition of the time of our Lord's public ministry exactly agrees with <a href="../../par/matthew/4-12.htm">Matthew 4:12-25</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/1.htm">Mark 1</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3.htm">Luke 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29-51</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Must one become a witness</span>, etc. The resurrection of Christ from the dead thus appears to be a cardinal doctrine of the gospel. The whole truth of Christ's mission, the acceptance of his sacrifice, the consequent forgiveness of sins, and all man's hopes of eternal life, turn upon it. All the sermons of the apostles recorded in the Acts and the Epistles also agree with this (see <a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2, 3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/5-31.htm">Acts 5:31, 32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/6.htm">Acts 6</a>:56, 59; 10:39-41; 13:30, etc.; <a href="../../par/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/1_peter/1.htm">1 Peter 1</a>.3; 3:21,22; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-5.htm">Revelation 1:5</a>,etc.). The great care taken to secure competent witnesses is very remarkable. A disciple who had recently joined the company might be mistaken; one who had been the daily companion of Jesus Christ for three years and a half, and knew every gesture and every feature of the Master with perfect certainty, could not be mistaken.

His work for Christ has no earthly record, except that Papias (Euseb., 'H.E.,' 3:39) says that, having drunk some deadly poison, by the grace of God he sustained no harm. Eusebius elsewhere (<a href="../../par/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>) says that he and Matthias were reported to be of the seventy, which is not improbable. The derivation of the name Barsabas, or Barsabbas, is unknown; it seems to be a patronymic (son of Sabas, or Sabbas), like Bar-Tholomew, Bar-Jonas, Bar-Jesus, etc. But it might also be descriptive of his qualities, like Barnabas, Son of Consolation (<a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>), in which case one would expect it to mean the same as <span class="cmt_word">Justus</span>, as in the case of "Thomas called <span class="accented">Didymus"</span> (<a href="../../par/john/20-4.htm">John 20:4</a>; where <span class="accented">Thomas</span> and <span class="accented">Di-dymus</span> both mean "a twin"); but no Aramean word of this signification is forthcoming. The surname Justus, with its derivatives Justinus and Justinianus, was not an uncommon Roman name. It was also borne by a Jewish historian contemporary with Josephus, Justus of Tiberias, the son of Pistus (see 'Life of Josephus,'&sect;&sect; 35, 65) and was the surname of James the Less. <span class="cmt_word">Matthias</span> not otherwise known, but said by Nicephorus to have preached and suffered martyrdom in Ethiopia. Eusebius ('H. E.,'3:24) mentions spurious Gospels "of Peter, Thomas, Matthias, and others," as quoted by heretics.

This was St. Paul's purpose, as he had written to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>) from Ephesus. He judged it wise, not only with a view to his own safety and that of his companions, but also for the rest and quiet of the Ephesian Church, to take advantage of the lull in the popular storm, and withdraw into quiet waters before any fresh outbreak occurred. Aquila and Priscilla seem to have left Ephesus about the same time, or soon after, since the Epistle to the Romans found them again at Rome (<a href="../../par/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>); and, if the view mentioned in the note to <a href="../../par/acts/19-40.htm">Acts 19:40</a> is true - that in the riot they had saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own - there were probably the same prudential motives for their leaving Ephesus as there were in the case of the apostle.

But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica.

It is not improbable that some at least of there followers were chosen by the Churches to carry their alms to Jerusalem (see <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19-23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3, 4</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-28</a>).

The narrative is so concise that the exact details are matters of conjecture. There is consequently much difference of opinion about them. Howson, with whom Farrar (vol. 2:274) apparently agrees, thinks that the whole party traveled together by land through Bercea and Thessalonica, to Philippi; that the party consisting of Sopater, Aristarchus and Secundus, Gains, Timothy, Tychicus, and Trophimus, went on at once from Philippi <span class="accented">via</span> Neapolis, to Troas, leaving St. Paul, who was now joined by St. Luke, at Philippi, to pass eight or nine days there during the Feast of the Passover. And this seems quite consistent with St. Luke's narrative. But Lewin (vol. it. p. 74) thinks that only St. Paul (accompanied, as he supposes, by Luke, Titus, and Jason) went to Macedonia, and that the others sailed direct from Cenchreae to Troas. Renan, on the other hand, thinks they all sailed together from Cenchreae to Neapolis, whence Paul's party went to Philippi, and the others to Troas. There is no clue to the reason why the party thus separated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a></div><div class="verse">And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Tarried</span> for <span class="accented">abode</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">We</span>; distinctly marking that Luke, the author of the narrative, whom we left at Philippi (<a href="../../par/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13, 14</a>), joined him again at the same place.

He attached him to his company again, and thus secured as his companion in the voyage the historian who was to write an account of it, with such infinite charm of manner and such perfect truth." It may be noted that this passage is quite conclusive against the notion entertained by some, that Timothy was the writer of the Acts. <span class="cmt_word">From Philippi</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from Neapolis, the port of Philippi. <span class="cmt_word">After the days of unleavened bread</span>, which lasted eight days, including the day of eating the Passover. <span class="cmt_word">In five days</span>.

As the last of these seven days was Sunday - " the first day of the week" - he must have arrived on the preceding Monday, and left Neapolis on the preceding Thursday.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-7.htm">Acts 20:7</a></div><div class="verse">And upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - We <span class="accented">were gathered</span> for <span class="accented">the disciples came</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">discoursed with</span> for <span class="accented">preached unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">intending</span> for <span class="accented">ready</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">prolonged</span> for <span class="accented">continued</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The first day of the week</span>.

This is also an important example of weekly communion as the practice of the first Christians. Comparing the phrase, "to break bread," with St. Luke's account of the institution of the Holy Eucharist (<a href="../../par/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>) and the passages just quoted in <a href="../../par/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, and St. Paul's language (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>), it is impossible not to conclude that the breaking of bread in the celebration of the Lord's Supper is an essential part of the holy sacrament, which man may not for any specious reasons omit. Further, this passage seems to indicate that evening Communion, after the example of the first Lord's Supper, was at this time the practice of the Church. It was preceded (see ver. 11) by the preaching of the Word. The following description, given by Justin Martyr, in his second Apology to Antoninus Plus (or Marcus Aurelius), of the Church assemblies in his day, not a hundred years after this time, is in exact agreement with it: - "On the day which is called Sunday, all (Christians) who dwell either in town or country come together to one place. The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read for a certain time, and then the president of the meeting, when the reader has stopped, makes a discourse, in which he instructs and exhorts the people to the imitation of the good deeds of which they have just heard. We then all rise up together, and address prayers (to God); and, when our prayers are ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president, to the best of his ability, offers up both prayers and thanksgivings, and the people assent, saving 'Amen.' And then the distribution of the bread and wine, over which the thanksgivings have been offered, is made to all present, and all partake of it." He adds that the elements are carried to the absent by the deacons, and that collections are made for poor widows, and orphans, and sick, and prisoners. <span class="cmt_word">Discoursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <a href="../../par/acts/17-17.htm">Acts 17:17</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Prolonged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>).

But since his time the whole gulf of Latmos has been filled up with soil brought down by the river, so that Miletus is no longer on the seacoast, and the new mouth of the Meander is to the west instead of to the east of Miletus, which lies about eight miles inland (Lewin, vol. it. p. 90; Smith's 'Dict. of Geog.').

Neither does the mention of his life, in the first instance, tally with that of "bonds and afflictions." The T.R., which has considerable support, seems to be far preferable. The first clause, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, means quite naturally," I take no account of anything;" I value nothing, neither liberty, nor ease, nor comfort. I am ready to suffer the loss of all things, and I do count them as dung (<a href="../../par/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-9</a>); and then he adds yet further, "Neither do I count my own life as precious, so as to accomplish my course," etc. This metaphor of running a race is a favorite one with St. Paul (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13, 14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To testify the gospel of the grace of God</span>. An invaluable epitome of the Christian ministry. The essential feature of the gospel is its declaration of God's free grace to a guilty world, forgiving sins, and imputing righteousness through faith in Jesus Christ. The distinctive work of the ministry is to declare that grace. So St. Paul describes his own ministry, and the record of his ministry in the Acts and in his Epistles exactly agrees with this description. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a></div><div class="verse">And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="accented">Went about</span> for <span class="accented">have gone</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">kingdom</span> for <span class="accented">kingdom of God</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">I know that ye all</span>, etc. It is a very perplexing question whether St. Paul in this statement spake with prophetic, and therefore infallible, foreknowledge, or whether he merely expressed the strong present conviction of his own mind, that he should never return to Asia again. The question is an important one, as the authenticity of the pastoral Epistles is in a great measure bound up with it. For, in the apparent failure of all hypotheses to bring the writing of them within the time of St. Luke's narrative, prior to St. Paul's journey to Rome, we are driven to the theory which places the writing of them, and the circumstances to which they allude, to a time subsequent to St. Paul's imprisonment at Rome. But this involves the supposition that St. Paul returned to Ephesus after his release from his Roman imprisonment (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-14.htm">1 Timothy 4:14</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-9.htm">2 Timothy 4:9-14, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>), and consequently that St. Paul's anticipation, that he was in Asia for the last lime, was not realized. The question is well discussed by Alford, in the 'Prolegomena to the Pastoral Epistles,' and in Paley's 'Horae Paulinae,' <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>. But it can hardly be said to be definitively settled (see above, note to ver. 15). Bengel thinks the explanation may be that most of those present were dead or dispersed when Paul returned some years later.

Now follows the weighty charge of this great bishop to the clergy assembled at his visitation. With the true feeling of a chief pastor, he thinks of the whole flock, but deals with them chiefly through the under-shepherds. If he can awaken in these individually a deep concern for the souls committed to their charge, he will have done the best that can be done for the fleck at large. The first step to such concern for the flock is that each be thoroughly alive to the worth and the wants of his own soul. "Take heed unto yourselves." He that is careless about his own salvation will never lie careful about the souls of others (comp. <a href="../../par/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the which the Holy Ghost</span>, etc. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1ff7;</span>, no doubt, does not strictly contain the idea of "over which;" but the idea of authoritative oversight is contained in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and therefore the rendering of the A.V., and of Alford's A.V. revised, is substantially correct.

The Vulgate, too, and the Syriac have it; and such early Fathers as Ignatius (in his Epistle to the Ephesians) and Tertullian use the phrase, "the blood of God," which seems to have been derived from this passage.

It should be added that the evidence for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> has been much strengthened by the publication by Tischendorf, in 1563, of rite Codex Sinaiticus, and in 1867 of the Codex Vaticanus, from his own collation. The result is that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> seems to be the true reading (see the first of the two collects for the Ember weeks in the Book of Common Prayer. With regard to the difficulty that this reading seems to imply the unscriptural phrase, "<span class="accented">the</span> blood of God," and to savor of the Monophysite heresy, it is obvious to reply that there is a wide difference between the phrase as it stands and such a one as the direct "<span class="accented">blood</span> of <span class="accented">God</span>," which Athanasius and others objected to. The mental insertion of "the Lord" or "Christ," as the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">purchased</span>," is very easy, the transition from God the Father to God incarnate being one that might be made almost imperceptibly. Others (including the R.T.) take the reading of several good manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and understand <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to be an ellipse for <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the phrase used in <a href="../../par/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>; and so render it "<span class="accented">which</span> he purchased by the blood of his own Son." <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, his own, is used without a substantive in <a href="../../par/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.

We have here one of the few chronological data in the Acts. Three years includes the whole of his sojourn at Ephesus as his headquarters. There were first the three months during which he preached in the synagogue; then the two years which he spent in preaching in the school of Tyrannus, and which terminated with the incident of burning the books of magic (<a href="../../par/acts/19-8.htm">Acts 19:8, 10, 19</a>).

A most beautiful and significant phrase! The apostle is leaving for ever the flock which he had fed with such devoted care and loved with such a fervent love. He was leaving them with a strong impression of the dangers to which they would be exposed. To whom could he entrust them? to what loving hands could he consign them? He gives them to God, to take watchful custody of them. He brings them to him in the prayer of faith. He commits to him the precious deposit (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>), to be preserved safe unto the day of Christ. So the Savior of the world, when dying on the cross, said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit "(<a href="../../par/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>), and then trustingly gave up the ghost (see too <a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>). No less beautiful are the words which follow: <span class="cmt_word">And to the word of his grace</span>. He was thinking of the grievous wolves, and of their pernicious doctrine; of the deceivers that should arise, and their soul-destroying heresies; and so he turns to the one source of safety "the Word of God's grace in Jesus Christ." If they are kept in that Word of truth, if they nourish their souls with that sincere milk, they will be safe. The gospel which he had preached would be their safety unto the end.

They say that St. Paul's self-denial in refusing the help he had a right to claim as an apostle, and supporting himself by his labor, was a great argument to convince the weak in faith of his disinterestedness and of the truth of his gospel, and so he recommends the elders of the Church to follow his example. But the word here is <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> rather suggest the idea of bodily weakness (<a href="../../par/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/luke/5-15.htm">Luke 5:15</a>, etc.), and the words of the Lord Jesus which follow suggest almsgiving to the needy. So that it is better to understand the word of the weakly and poor, those unable to work for themselves. Doubtless St. Paul, out of his scanty earnings, found something to give to the sick and needy. The sentiment in our text is thus exactly analogous to the precept in <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>. The very word there used, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, recalls the <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> of ver. 34. <span class="cmt_word">To remember the words of the Lord Jesus</span>. This is a solitary instance era saying of our Lord's, not recorded in the Gospels, being referred to in Scripture. There are many alleged sayings of Christ recorded in apocryphal Gospels or in the writings of Fathers as Papias and others (Routh, 'Reliq. Sac.,' 1:9, 10, 12), some of which may be authentic; but this alone is warranted by Scripture. How it came to St Paul's knowledge, and that of the Ephesian elders to whom he seems to have taken for granted that it was familiar, it is impossible to say. But it seems likely that, in those very early days, some of the Lord's unwritten words may have floated in the memory of men, and been preserved by word of mouth. Clement (1 Corinthians it.) seems to refer to the saying when he writes in praise of the former character of the Corinthians, that they were then <span class="greek">&#x1f25;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>.

In 2 Macc. 12:10 it means simply" withdrawn," and so perhaps also in <a href="../../par/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>, though Meyer thinks that St. Luke chose the unusual word to denote the urgent emotion by which our Lord was as it were compelled to leave the companionship of the apostles, and be alone. <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;</span> (whence spasm) and its derivatives, of which Luke uses four - two of which are peculiar to him - are much employed by medical writers, as Hippocrates, Galen, Antaeus, etc. (Hobart, on <a href="../../par/luke/22.htm">Luke 22</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">Had set sail</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>).

From <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes, of course, our word "meteor." <span class="cmt_word">Cos</span>, or <span class="accented">Coos</span>, for it is written both ways, now called by the Turks <span class="accented">Stanko</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1ff6;</span>), a beautiful island, nearly opposite the Gulf of Halicarnassus, and separated from Cnidus by a narrow strait, about six hours' sail from Miletus. There is a city of the same name on its eastern coast. It was one of the six Dorian colonies which formed the confederation called the Dorian Hexapolis. It was famous for its wine and its textile fabrics (Howson, and Lewin, and 'Dict. of Geog.'). <span class="cmt_word">Rhodes</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a1;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); perhaps the "Isle of Roses;" the well-known mountainous island in the AEgean Sea, which lies nine or ten miles from the coast of Carts. Its inhabitants were Dorians, and it was one of the places which claimed the honor of being the birthplace of Homer. The towns are all situated on the seacoast, "Rhodes was the last Christian city to make a stand against the Saracens" (Howson). <span class="cmt_word">Patara</span> ([<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>] <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>). A flourishing commercial city on the south-west coast of Lycia, with a good harbor. It was the port of Xauthus, the capital of Lycia. The name <span class="accented">Patera</span> is still attached to some extensive ruins on the seashore not far from the river Xanthus.

The ship in which St. Paul and his companions had hitherto sailed was probably a coasting-vessel, intending to continue its course all along the south coast of Asia Minor. But at Patara they found a ship on the point of sailing across the open sea direct to Tyre, by which the voyage would be shortened many days. They accordingly immediately took their passage by it, and put out to sea (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 1, note). A glance at the map will show what a great corner was thus cut off. A straight line from Patara to Tyro leaves Cyprus just on the left.

The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> is peculiar to St. Luke, occur-tug elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="../../par/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>.

Tyre at this time was still a city of some commercial importance, with two harbors, one north and one south of the causeway which connected the island with the mainland (see <a href="../../par/acts/12-20.htm">Acts 12:20</a>). Howson thinks the ship in which St. Paul sailed may have brought wheat from the Black Sea, and taken up Phoenician wares in exchange. The sight of Cyprus as he sailed by must have brought many and very various memories to the apostle's mind, of Barnabas, of Sergius Paulus, of Elymas, and many others.

When last we heard of him (<a href="../../par/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>) he had just reached Caesarea; apparently he had been working there as an evangelist ever since. His old home at Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>) had been broken up by the persecution (<a href="../../par/acts/8-5.htm">Acts 8:5</a>), and thus the deacon had become an evangelist (<a href="../../par/acts/8-12.htm">Acts 8:12</a>). <span class="accented">Evangelists</span> are mentioned by St. Paul(<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>) as one of the higher orders of the Christian ministry; and Timothy is bid "do the work of an evangelist" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-5.htm">2 Timothy 4:5</a>). In later times the term was restricted to the four writers of the Gospels. Philip's old association with Stephen in the diaconate must have been keenly remembered by St. Paul. <span class="cmt_word">We abode with him</span>.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a></div><div class="verse">And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Now this man</span> for <span class="accented">and the same man</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Virgins</span>.

The question arises - Did they exercise their gift of prophecy in the Church or in private? The passage <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a> seems to indicate that in the Church of Corinth women did pray and prophesy in the congregation, while, on the other hand, <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-34.htm">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</a> seems peremptorily to forbid women to speak or teach in Church, as does <a href="../../par/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</a>. How, then, is this apparent contradiction to be reconciled? It must be either by supposing <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the gift of prophecy spoken of here and in <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a> was exercised in private only; or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the prohibition did not apply to the extraordinary operation of the Holy Spirit speaking by prophet or prophetesses as the case might be. The latter seems the most probable (see <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, note). On the office of prophets in the early Church, see <a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/15-32.htm">Acts 15:32</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10, 28, 29</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2, 8</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-6.htm">1 Corinthians 14:6, 29</a>, etc.; <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a> (see Alford, on <a href="../../par/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>). As regards these daughters of Philip, there are conflicting statements in early Church writers. Eusebius ('Eccl. Hist.,' 3:30) quotes Clement of Alexandria as saying that both Peter and Philip among the apostles were married and had children, and that Philip moreover gave his daughters in marriage to husbands. But in the next chapter <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> he quotes Polycrates, Bishop of Ephesus at the end of the second century, as saying that Philip the apostle and his two daughters, who had grown old in their virginity, were buried at Hierapolis; and that another daughter of his, "who had her conversation in the Holy Spirit," was buried at Ephesus. Eusebius himself thinks that these daughters of Philip the evangelist were meant. If they were, it does not necessarily follow that those who, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, were married were of the four mentioned here. They might be sisters. Polycrates seems to speak of three sisters who lived a religious life (in the technical sense); the fourth may have died young. But it is quite possible that Clemens may really be speaking of Philip the apostle, and Polycrates also; the more so as Philip the apostle, according to the tradition recorded by Nicephorns, suffered martyrdom at Hierapolis. However, the confusion between the two Philips is quite certain in the Menaeum (or Calendar) of the Greek Church, where we read, "On the 4th of September is the commemoration of Saint Hermione, one of the four daughters of the Apostle Philip, who baptized the eunuch of Candace. She and her sister Eutychis came into Asia after the death of the Apostle John. She was buried at Ephesus." A fragment of Caius (in Eusebius, 'Eccl. Hist.,' 3:31) increases the confusion by speaking of" the four daughters of Philip, prophetesses, who were buried in Hierapolis" (see Routh's 'Reliq. Sac.,' vol. 1. pp. 378-380).

As regards the transaction recommended by James, Kypke (quoted by Meyer) says, "It was a received thing among the Jews, and was reckoned an act of eminent piety, for a rich man to undertake to bear, on behalf of poor Nazarites, the expense of those sacrifices which they had to offer when they shaved their heads at the expiration of their vow." Josephus seems to allude to the custom, and to speak of King Agrippa as acting in accordance with it, when he says of him that he ordered great numbers of Nazarites to be shaved ('Ant. Jud.,' 19. 6:1). The sacrifices were costly, consisting of" three beasts, one for a burnt offering, another for a sin offering, and a third for a peace offering" (Lightfoot, vol. 9. p. 307).

What was the particular form by which a person who wished to associate himself with others under a Nazaritic vow (note on ver. 24) did so is not known; nor how long before the expiration of the vow such association must be made. But from the mention of "seven days" in ver. 27 (which is the number named in <a href="../../par/numbers/6-9.htm">Numbers 6:9</a>, in case of an accidental uncleanness), it seems highly probable that "seven days" was the term during which a person must have conformed to the Nazaritic vow to entitle him to "be at charges," as well, perhaps, as the time during which Nazarites, at the end of their vow, had to undergo special purification. <span class="cmt_word">Declaring the fulfillment</span>, etc. The vow of the four men had been for at least thirty days (the minimum period of such vow); but whatever length of time it had been for, such time would have expired by the end of the seven days, and probably long before. We know not how long they might have been waiting for some one to "be at charges" for them, and provide the sacrifices, without which they could not shave their heads and accomplish their vow. But it is obvious that some notice must be given to the priests in the temple of the day when one or more Nazarites would present themselves at "the door of the tabernacle of the congregation," to offer the prescribed offerings. And this accordingly Paul and the four did. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> means "notifying," or "declaring," to the priests (<a href="../../par/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a> [LXX., answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>]; <a href="../../par/romans/9-27.htm">Romans 9:27</a>; Joshua 6:9, LXX. [Joshua 6:10, A.V., "bid"]). <span class="cmt_word">Until the offering was offered</span>, etc. This is interpreted in two ways. Meyer makes "until" depend upon "the fulfillment of the days," so as to define that fulfillment as not taking place till the offering was offered. Wieseler makes "until" depend upon "he entered into the temple," with the idea supplied, "and remained there," or "came there daily;" supposing that it was the custom for Nazarites to finish up their time of separation by passing the last seven days, or at least being present daily, in "the court of the women, where was the apartment appropriated to the Nazarites" (Lewin, it. p. 142). If, however, with Howson, Lewin and others, we understand the word <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in vers. 24 and 20, not generally of taking the Nazarite vow, but of certain special purifications at the close of a Nazaritic vow, which lasted seven days immediately before the offerings were made and the head shaven, then a very easy and natural rendering of the words follows: "Notifying their intention of now completing the seven days of their purification, until the offering for each of them was offered." Alford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., justifies by examples the aorist indicative <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, instead of the subjunctive, which is more usual. Lewin thinks that St. Paul had taken a Nazaritic vow after his escape from death at Ephesus, or at Corinth; but there is no evidence of this, and it is hardly consistent with James's advice. Renan thinks it doubtful whether or no Paul took the Nazaritic vow at all, but inclines to this as the best interpretation ('St. Paul,' p. 518, note).

Where it adjoined the colonnades of the temple it had passages leading down to both, through which the guards - for in the fortress there always lay a Roman legion - descended and disposed themselves about the colonnades in arms at the festivals, to watch the people, and repress any insurrectionary movement."

In the only two other places were it occurs in the New Testament (<a href="../../par/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/5-12.htm">Galatians 5:12</a>) it is transitive. It is not a classical word. <span class="cmt_word">The four thousand men</span>. Josephus, in the above-cited passage, reckons the followers of the Egyptian impostor at above thirty thousand. But such discrepancies are of no account, partly because of the known looseness with which numbers are stated, and Josephus's disposition to exaggerate; partly because of the real fluctuation in the numbers of insurgents at different periods of an insurrection; and partly because it is very possible that a soldier like Lysias would take no count of the mere rabble, but only of the disciplined and armed soldiers such as these Sicarii were. It may be added that Josephus himself seems to distinguish between the rabble and the fighting men, because, though in the 'Bell. Jud.,' it. 13:5 he says that Felix attacked or took prisoners "most of his followers," in the 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:6 he makes the number of slain "four hundred," and of prisoners "two hundred" - a very small proportion of thirty thousand. The Egyptian had premised his deluded followers that the walls of Jerusalem would fall down like those of Jericho. It is not known exactly in what year the insurrection took place, but it was, as Renan says, "pen de temps auparavant" ('St. Paul,' p. 525). The Egyptian himself contrived to run away and disappear; hence the thought that he was the author of this new tumult at Jerusalem. The Sicarii were a band of fanatical murderers, who, in the disturbed times preceding the destruction of Jerusalem, went about armed with daggers, and in broad daylight and in the public thoroughfares murdered whoever was obnoxious to them. Among others they murdered the high priest Jonathan at the instigation of Felix (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 6:7; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2, 13:3).

It was strikingly in harmony with his addressing them as "brethren" that he should speak to them in their own mother tongue. There is a living reality in such touches which seems at once to refute Renan's suspicion that St. Luke invented this and other of St. Paul's speeches in the later chapters of the Acts. The full report of these later speeches is abundantly accounted for by the fact that through this time St. Luke was with St. Paul, and heard the speeches.

The natural understanding of the preceding dialogue is that Saul, when bid depart quickly out of Jerusalem because the Jews would not receive his testimony, was unwilling to obey, and pleaded that surely the Jews must listen to him and be convinced, since they were well aware how hot and zealous a partisan of the Jews he had been, and must see that nothing but a great miracle could have converted him. It was the argument of a young and impetuous man, with little experience of the headstrong obstinacy of bigoted men.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a></div><div class="verse">And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ananias</span>, the son of Nebedaeus, successor of Joseph the son of Camel, or Camydus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 1:3; 5:2), appears to have been actually high priest at this time. He was a violent, haughty, gluttonous, and rapacious man, and vet looked up to by the Jews ("tres considere," Renan). He had probably lately returned from Rome, having been confirmed, as it seems, in his office by Claudius, to whom Quadratus, the predecessor of Felix, has sent him as a prisoner, to answer certain charges of sedition against him. He seems to have been high priest for the unusually long period of over ten years - from A.D.  to A.D.  (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 5:2; 6:2, 3; 8:8). But, on the other hand, Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:5) speaks of a certain <span class="accented">Jonathan</span> being high priest during the government of Felix, and being murdered by the Sicarii at his instigation; which looks as if Ananias's high priesthood had been interrupt el. It would appear, too, from 20. 8:8, that Ismael the son of Fabi succeeded to Jonathan, net to Ananias, as is usually supposed. But the question is involved in great obscurity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-3.htm">Acts 23:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, <i>thou</i> whited wall: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">for</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">according to</span> for <span class="accented">after</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">God shall smite thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). A distinct announcement of something that would happen. (For the incident itself, comp. <a href="../../par/1_kings/22-24.htm">1 Kings 22:24, 25</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15, 17</a>; and <a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2, 23</a>) Ananias perished by the daggers of the Sicarii (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud,' 2. 17:9), at the beginning of the Jewish war under the procuratorship of Florus, in the year A.D. . He had been previously deposed from the high priesthood by King Agrippa toward the close of the government of Felix ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8), about A.D. , or early in A.D. , less than two years from the present time. <span class="cmt_word">Thou whited wall</span>. This expression is admirably illustrated by the quotations from Seneca in Kuinoel: "These base and sordid spirits are like the walls of their own houses, only beautiful on the outside." "What are our gilt roofs hut lies? for we well know that under the gilding unseemly beams are concealed." "It is not only our walls which are coated with a thin outward ornament; the greatness of those men whom you see strutting in their pride is mere tinsel; look beneath the surface, and you will see all the evil that is hid under that thin crust of dignity" ('De Provid.,' 6, and 'Epist.' 115). Ananias was sitting in his priestly robes of office, presiding over the council in power and dignity, and presumably a righteous judge, but his heart within was polluted with injustice, selfishness, and a corrupt disposition, which made him act unrighteously (comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Contrary to the Law</span>; or, <span class="accented">acting illegally</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, only found here in the New Testament, but common in classical Greek. St. Paul's temper was very excusably roused by the brutality and injustice of Ananias. But we may, perhaps, think that he did not quite attain to "the mind that was in Christ Jesus," who "when he was reviled, reviled not again," but was "led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, he opened not his mouth" (<a href="../../par/acts/8-32.htm">Acts 8:32</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-4.htm">Acts 23:4</a></div><div class="verse">And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God's high priest?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God's high priest</span>. This seems to show that Ananias actually was high priest, though some think that he had thrust himself into the office after his return from Rome, without due authority, and that this was the reason why St. Paul excused himself by saying, in ver. 5, "I wist not that he was high priest." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-5.htm">Acts 23:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- And Paul said</span> for <span class="accented">then said Paul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">high</span> for <span class="accented">the high</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a ruler</span> for <span class="accented">the ruler</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">I wist not</span>, etc. These words express, as distinctly as words can express anything, that St. Paul was not aware, when he called Ananias a "whited wall," that he was addressing the high priest. Different reasons for this ignorance have been given. Some think that it arose from the uncertainty that existed whether Ananias really was high priest or not at this time, or whether the office was not in abeyance. Others attribute to Paul's weakness of sight the fact that he did not see that Ananias was sitting in the presidential chair, neither was able to recognize his features. Others, giving to <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;</span> sense which it never bus, render, "I did not reflect," or "bear in mind, that he was high priest." What is certain is that for some reason or other Paul did not know that he was speaking to the high priest. Had he known it, he would not have said what he did say, because the Law is express which says, <span class="greek">&#x1f0c;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>, LXX.). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a></div><div class="verse">But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.

With a ready wit, therefore, he proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and, seizing upon the great dogma of the resurrection, which Christians held in common with the Pharisees, he rallied to his side all who were Pharisees in the assembly. <span class="cmt_word">Of Pharisees</span>. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (in the plural), which gives the sense that his ancestors were Pharisees (comp. <a href="../../par/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Touching the hope</span>, etc. (see <a href="../../par/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>). The words are somewhat difficult to construe. Some take "the hope and resin'. rection of the dead" for a hendiadys, equivalent to "the hope of the resurrection of the dead." Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> by itself, as meaning "the hope of a future life." Perhaps the exact form of the words is, "Touching the hope and (its ultimate object) the resurrection of the dead I am called in question." The article is omitted after the preposition (Alford). As regards St. Paul's action in taking advantage of the strong party feeling by which the Sanhedrim was divided, there is a difference of opinion. Some, as Alford, think that the presence of mind and skill with which Paul divided the hostile assembly was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise (<a href="../../par/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>; see Homiletics, 1-11) to suggest by his Spirit to those under persecution what they ought to say. Farrar, on the contrary, strongly blames St. Paul, and says," The plan showed great knowledge of character... but was it worthy of St. Paul?... Could he worthily say, 'I am a Pharisee'? Had he any right to inflame an existing animosity?" and more to the same effect (vol. it. pp. 325-328). But it could not be wrong for St. Paul to take advantage of the agreement of Christian doctrine with some of the tenets of the Pharisees, to check the Pharisees from joining with the Sadducees in crushing that doctrine. He had never thrown off his profession as a Jew, and if a Jew, then one of the straitest sect of the Jews, in any of its main features; and if he claimed the freedom of a Roman citizen to save himself from scourging, why not the fact of being a Pharisee of Pharisees to save himself from an iniquitous sentence of the Sanhedrim?

The capital of heathendom must hear his testimony as well the metropolis of the circumcision.

This word occurs nowhere else in Scripture or in any ancient Greek author. It is first found in" Theophylactus Simocatta, in the seventh century, and then again in the tenth century in Constantine Porphyrogenitus" (Meyer). It seems most probable that it was the name of some particular kind of light infantry. But it is not easy to explain the etymology. Perhaps they were a kind of skirmishers thrown out on a march to protect the flanks of an army; as Plutarch speaks of javelin-men and slingers being placed to guard, not only the rear, but also the flanks of the army on the march (Steph., 'Thesaur.,' under <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). "Holding or taking the right" might be the force of the compound, somewhat after the analogy of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, etc.; which agrees with the explanations of Phavorinus <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and with that of Beza, "Qui alicui dextrum latus [meaning simply <span class="accented">latus</span>] munit." Only, instead of the improbable notion of these men being a body-guard of the tribune - which their number makes impossible - it should be understood of the troops which protect the flank of an army on the march. Other improbable explanations are that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> means the soldier to whom the right hand of prisoners was fastened, or those who grasp with the right hand their weapon, the lance or javelin. The object of Lysias in sending so large a force was to guard against the possibility of a rescue in the feverish and excited state of the Jewish mind. And no doubt one reason for sending Paul away was his dread of a Jewish riot.

Sergius Paulus (<a href="../../par/acts/13-7.htm">Acts 13:7, 8</a>) was a proconsul, and so was Gallio (<a href="../../par/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a>); Pontius Pilate (<a href="../../par/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>) and Felix were procurators, <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, only in a looser sense, as the more exact name of their office was <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> procurator. Only, as they were appointed by the emperor, and often exercised the full functions of a legatus Caesaris, they were called <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> as well as proprietors. <span class="cmt_word">Felix</span>, called by Tacitus, Antonius Felix ('Hist.,' 5:9), was the brother of Pallas, the freedman and favorite of Claudius. He as well as his brother Felix had originally been the slave of Antonia the mother of the Emperor Claudius; and hence the name <span class="accented">Antonins Felix</span>, or, as he was sometimes otherwise celled, Claudius Felix. Tacitus, after mentioning that Claudius appointed as governors of Judaea sometimes knights and sometimes freedmen, adds that among the last Autenius Felix ruled this province with boundless cruelty and in the most arbitrary manner, showing by his abuse of power his servile origin. He adds that he married Drusilla, the granddaughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, so that he was Mark Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius was Antony's grandson. But see <a href="../../par/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>, note. In the 'Annals' (12. 5) Tacitus further speaks of the incompetence of Felix to govern, stirring up rebellions by the means he took to repress them, and of the utter lawlessness and confusion to which the province was reduced by the maladministration of Felix and his colleague, Ventidius Cumanus ("cut pars provinciae habebatur"). He adds that civil war would have broken out if Quadratus, the Governor of Syria, had not interposed, and secured the punishment of Cumanus, while Felix, his equal in guilt, was continued in his government. This was owing, no doubt, to the influence of Pallas. The same influence secured the continued government to Felix upon Nero's accession, Pallas being all-powerful with Agrippina. Such was "the most excellent governor Felix." For further accounts of him, see Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' 2. 12:8; 13.), who ignores his share in the government as the partner of Cumauus, and dates his appointment subsequently to the con-detonation of Cumanus at Rome, and is also there silent as to his misdeeds. (For further accounts of Felix, see 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2; 8:5-7, which relate his adulterous marriage with Drusilla, and some of his murders and cruelties.)

According to Howson, following the American traveller, the Rev. Eli Smith, the route lay from Jerusalem to Gophna, on the road to Nablous, and from Gophna, leaving the great north road by a Roman road of which many distinct traces remain, to Antipatris, avoiding Lydda or Diospolis altogether. Gophna is three hours from Jerusalem, and, as they started at 9 p.m., would be reached by midnight. Five or six hours more would bring them to Antipatris, most of the way being downhill from the hill country of Ephraim to the plain of Sharon. Attera halt of two or three hours, a march of six hours would bring them to Caesarea, which they may have reached in the afternoon.

It implies that Felix had been absent from Caesarea for some days after the trial. <span class="cmt_word">Drusilla</span>. She was, according to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 7:1, 2) the daughter of Herod Agrippa I., who "killed James with the sword" (<a href="../../par/acts/12-1.htm">Acts 12:1, 2</a>), and died shortly afterwards. She was first the wife of Azizus, King of Emesa; but Felix, becoming enamored of her on account of her singular beauty, employed a certain magician, a Jew named Simon, to entice her away from her husband, and persuade her to marry him, contrary, as Josephus says, to the institutions of her country. She perished, with Agrippa, her only son by Felix, in the eruption of Vesuvius, in the reign of Titus (Josephus, as above). Tacitus says that Drusilla, the wife of Felix, was granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra. But he seems to have confounded her with another of the three royal wives of Felix, mentioned by Suetonius in 'Claudius;' unless, perchance, as has been conjectured, be had two wives of the name of Drusilla, of whom one was, as Tacitus says, granddaughter of Antony, by being the daughter of King Juba and Cleopatra Selene, Antony's daughter (see note in Whiston's 'Josephus,' and in Kuinoel, on <a href="../../par/acts/23-24.htm">Acts 23:24</a>). But there is no certainty on the subject. Only Josephus's detailed account of Drusilla, the wife of Felix, agrees with St. Luke's statement that she "was a Jewess," and is beyond doubt true.

But the impression derived from Josephus is the same as that conveyed by St. Luke, that he was a just and upright ruler, in marked contrast with Felix his predecessor, and his successors Albinus and Gessius Florus. <span class="cmt_word">Desiring to gain favor</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); literally, <span class="accented">to lay up in store good will</span>, or favor, or <span class="accented">a boon</span>, to be requited at some future period. A frequent phrase in the best classical authors. Felix had good reason thus to try and put the Jews under obligation to him at the close of his government. For the danger was great to the retiring governor of complaints being sent to the emperor of oppression and plunder, which were often listened to and punished. Josephus relates, in point of fact, that the chief Jews in Caesarea sent an embassy to Rome to lodge a charge against Felix before Nero; and that he only escaped punishment by the influence of his brother Pallas ('Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:9). The scene in this chapter is a very striking one, depicted with admirable simplicity and force. The bloated slave sitting on the seat of judgment and power, representing all the worst vices of Roman degeneracy. The beads of the sinking Jewish commonwealth, blinded by bigotry and nearly mad with hatred, forgetting for the moment their abhorrence of their Roman masters, in their yet deeper detestation of the Apostle Paul. The hired advocate with his fulsome flattery, his rounded periods, and his false charges. And then the great apostle, the noble confessor, the finished Christian gentleman, the pure-minded, upright, and fearless man, pleading his own cause with consummate force and dignity, and overawing his heathen judge by the majesty of his character. It is a graphic description of s very noble scene. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/23.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 23"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 23" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/25.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 25"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 25" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/acts/25.htm"><title>Acts 25 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/acts/25.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/acts/25.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/acts/25-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../acts/24.htm" title="Acts 24">&#9668;</a> Acts 25 <a href="../acts/26.htm" title="Acts 26">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a></div><div class="verse">Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> <span class="accented">- Foetus therefore having come</span> for <span class="accented">now when Foetus was come</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">went up</span> for <span class="accented">he ascended</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to Jerusalem from Casarea</span> for <span class="accented">from Caesarea to Jerusalem</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The province</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); above, <a href="../../par/acts/23-34.htm">Acts 23:34</a>. <span class="cmt_word">After three days</span>, etc. It is an evidence of the diligence of Foetus that he lost no time in going to Jerusalem, the center of disaffection to the Roman government.

But the reading of the T.R., "the high priest," is more in accordance with <a href="../../par/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>, and is approved by Alford. The high priest at this time was no longer Ananias, but Ismael the son of Phabi, who was appointed by King Agrippa towards the close of Felix's government (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 20. 8:8). He went to Rome to appeal to Nero about the wall which the Jews had built to screen the temple from being overlooked, and which Agrippa had ordered to be pulled down; and being detained at Rome as a hostage, he was succeeded in the high priesthood by Joseph Cabi the son of Simon. We may feel sure that on this occasion he was present before Festus, for he had not yet gone to Rome. <span class="cmt_word">Informed him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="../../par/acts/24-1.htm">Acts 24:1</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">The principal men of the Jews</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>).

The question arises as to whether the two phrases are identical in their meaning. Meyer thinks that the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> includes leading men who were not elders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not Sanhedrists.

Festus did not merely mention the fact, which the Jews knew already, that Paul was a prisoner at Caesarea, but his determination to keep him there till he could go down and try him. The A.V. gives the meaning. Either <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is to be understood, as if Foetus should say, "Paul is a Roman citizen; Caesarea is the proper place for him to be tried at before the procurator, and therefore he must be kept in custody there," or some such words as, "I have given orders" must be understood before "that Paul should be kept."

It was not unnatural that Festus, ignorant as he still was of Jewish malice and bigotry and violence, in the case of Paul, and anxious to conciliate a people so difficult to govern as the Jews had showed themselves to be, should make the proposal.

The judgment-seat of the procurator, who ministered judgment in Caesar's name and by his authority, was rightly called "Caesar's judgment-seat." As a Roman citizen, Paul had a right to be tried there, and not before the Sanhedrim. The pretence that he had offended against the Jewish Law, and therefore ought to be tried by the Jewish court, was a false one, as Festus well knew; for he had the record of the preceding trial before him.

St. Paul saw at once the danger he was in from Festus's inclination to curry favor with the Jews. With his usual fearlessness, therefore, and perhaps with the same quickness of temper which made him call Ananias "a whited wall," he said, "No man (not even the mighty Roman governor) may make me over to them at their request, to please them," and with the ready wit which characterized him, and with a knowledge of the rights which the <span class="accented">Lex Julia</span>, in addition to other laws, conferred on him as a Roman citizen, he immediately added, I appeal unto Caesar.

In like manner, Pliny (quoted by Kuinoel) says of certain Christians who had appealed to Caesar, that, "because they were Roman citizens, he had thought it right to send them to Rome for trial" ('Epist.,' 10:97). Festus, though, maybe, rather startled by Paul's appeal, was perhaps not sorry to be thus rid of a difficult case, and at the same time to leave the Jews under the impression that he himself was willing to send the prisoner for trial to Jerusalem, had it been possible.

Augustus</span> was the title conferred by the senate upon Octavius Caesar,  <span class="date">B.C. 27</span>, whom we commonly designate <span class="accented">Augustus Caesar.</span> It became afterwards the distinctive title of the reigning emperor, and, after the end of the second century, sometimes of two or even three co-emperors, and was now berne by Nero.

It is spoken of all holy things, temples and the like, "Et queocunque sua Jupiter auget ope" (Ovid, 'Fast.,' 1:609); and, as Ovid says in the same passage, is a title proper to the gods. For, comparing it with the names of the greatest Roman families, Maximus, Magnus, Torquatus, Corvus, etc., their names, he says, bespeak human honors, but of Augustus, he says, "Hie socium summo cum Jove nomen habet." And so the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> bespeaks a veneration closely akin to adoration. <span class="cmt_word">Caesar</span>, originally the name of a family of the Juliagens, became the name of Octavius Caesar Augustus, as the adopted son of Julius Caesar; then of Tiberius, as the adopted son of Augustus; and then of the successors of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, who had by descent or adoption some relationship to C. Julius Caesar the great dictator. After Nero, succeeding emperors usually prefixed the name of Caesar to their other names, and placed that of Augustus after them. AElius Verus, adopted by Hadrian, was the first person who bore the name of Caesar without being emperor. From this time it became usual for the heir to the throne to bear the name; and later, for many of the emperor's kindred to be so called. It was, in fact, a title of honor conferred by the emperor.

The proverb <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, to kick against the ox-goads, as the unbroken bullock does to his own hurt, instead of quietly submitting, as he must do at last, to go the way and the pace his master chooses he should go, is found in Pindar, AEschylus, Euripides, Plautus, Terence, etc. The <span class="accented">passages</span> are given in Bochart, 'Hierozoicon.,' part 1. lib. it. Acts 39; in Kninoel, and in Bishop Wordsworth. The passage in Eurip., 'Baach,' 1. 793, 794 (750, 751), brings out the force of the proverb, viz. fruitless resistance to a superior power, most distinctly: "<span class="accented">Better</span> to sacrifice to him, than, being mortal, by vainly raging against God, to kick against the goads." Saul had better yield at once to the constraining grace of God, and no longer do despite to the Spirit of grace. It does not appear clearly that the proverb was used by the Hebrews. Dr. Donaldson ('Christian Orthodoxy,' p. 293) affirms that" there is no Jewish use of this proverbial expression." And this is borne out by Lightfoot, who adduces the two passages, <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-9.htm">1 Samuel 2:9</a>, as the only evidences of the existence of such a proverb, together with a rabbinical saying, "R. Bibai sat and taught, and R. Isaac Ben Cahna kicked against him" ('Exereit. on <span class="accented">Acts</span>,' <span class="accented">9:</span>5). It is, therefore, a curious question how this classical phrase came to be used here. Bishop Wordsworth <span class="accented">says</span>, "<span class="accented">Even</span> in heaven our Lord did not disdain to use a proverb familiar to the heathen world." But, perhaps, we may assume that such a proverb was substantially in use among the Jews, though no distinct evidence of it has been preserved; and that St. Paul, in rendering the Hebrew words of Jesus into Greek, made use of the language of Euripides, with which he was familiar, in a case bearing a strong analogy to his own, viz. the resistance of Pentheus to the claims of Bacchus. This is to a certain extent borne out by the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (<a href="../../par/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/23-9.htm">Acts 23:9</a>); the latter of which is twice used in the 'Bacchae' of Euripides, though not common elsewhere.

The A.V. gives the sense by a periphrasis; only it must be well understood that it was especially by being the first to rise, and so to bring life and immortality to light, that Christ showed light to the people. The words may, of course, be construed as the R.V. does, but such a rendering is not in accordance with the spirit of the passage or the analogy of other passages. Christ was the first rise, and he will be followed by them that are his. But it is not true to say that he was the first to give light to Jews and Gentiles, and will be followed by others doing the same. (For the sentiment, setup. <a href="../../par/luke/2-32.htm">Luke 2:32</a>.) Note on the whole the enormous stress laid by St. Paul on the fulfillment of prophecy as a proof of the truth of the gospel, following therein our Lord himself (<a href="../../par/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25, 27, 44, 45</a>).

The excited interruption by Festus shows that he was unable to accept the truths enunciated by the apostle. The ideas of fulfilled prophecy, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of a crucified Jew giving light to the great Roman world, were" foolishness unto him," because he lacked spiritual discernment.

This saying of Agrippa's is obscure and variously explained. The A.V., following Chrysostom, Beza, Luther, etc., takes <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "within a little" or" almost," like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span>, which is very suitable to the context. The corresponding <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, or, as otherwise read, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would then mean, as in the A.V., "altogether," and the sense of the whole passage is striking and appropriate. But there is some difficulty in getting Otis meaning out of the words. The natural way of expressing it would be <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>. Hence many other commentators take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "in a short time," and the sense to be either "you are making short work of my conversion: you are persuading me to become a Christian as suddenly as you yourself did;" with a corresponding sense for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>, "in a long time," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether it takes a short or a long time, I pray God you may become a Christian like myself;" or, "you are soon persuading me," you will soon persuade me if you go on any longer in this strain. Others, again, preferring the reading <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> in ver. 29, take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> to mean "with little trouble," or "with few words," as <a href="../../par/ephesians/3-5.htm">Ephesians 3:5</a> (understanding <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), "lightly" (Alford), and then the opposite <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span> would mean "with much trouble," "with many words," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "with difficulty." But this is rather a fiat rendering. Another difference of opinion is whether the words of Agrippa are to be taken ironically, or sarcastically, or jestingly, or whether they are to be taken seriously, as the words of a man shaken in his convictions and seriously impressed by what he had heard. The whole turn of the narrative seems to favor the latter view. Another view, started by Chrysostom, is that Agrippa used the words in one sense, and St. Paul (mistakenly or advisedly) took them in another. Another possible explanation is that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> is here used in the sense in which Thucydides employs the phrase (it. 86 and Ephesians 4:26), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, viz.

Judas of Galilee (<a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>) drew "much" people after him; the Jews at Damascus conspired to kill Saul after "many" days were fulfilled (<a href="../../par/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>); Paul and Barnabas abode "long time" at Iconium (<a href="../../par/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>); Paul talked a "long" while at Tress (<a href="../../par/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>); and they sailed slowly off the coast of Asia "many" days (ver. 7); the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "sufficiency" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) must depend in each case upon the standard by which it is measured. Here "much time," measured by the common experience of sailing-vessels waiting for a favorable wind, may mean one or two weeks.

The Jews considered navigation unsafe between the Feast of Tabernacles (five days after the Day of Atonement) and the Feast of Pentecost (Lewin, vol. it. p. 192, note). It became, therefore, a very serious question what they were to do. Fair Havens was an inconvenient anchorage for the winter, and not near any large town. On the other hand, if they passed beyond the shelter of Cape Matala, which lay a few miles to the east, and where the coast of Crete suddenly trends due north, they would be exposed to the violence of the Eterian westerly wind.

It is found also in classical writers. <span class="cmt_word">Looking north-east and south-east.</span> The margin of the R.V. has "Greek, <span class="accented">down the southwest wind, and down the north-west."</span> This phrase has caused considerable perplexity to commentators. To say, as a recommendation of a harbor for winter quarters, that it lies or looks toward the south-west and north-west, and consequently is exposed to the most furious winter storms, is obviously impossible. If Phoenix was open to the south-west and the north-west, it would not be as commodius a place to winter in as Fair Havens was which was sheltered by Cape Matala. Two methods, therefore, have been adopted of explaining the phrase so as to make it give a reasonable sense. One, that adopted by Dean Howson and Bishop Wordsworth, viz. that it looks southwest and north-west, from the point of view of the sailor, or any one approaching it from the sea, the object upon which it looks being the land which locks it in and shelters it. The other is that supported by Alford, and adopted by the R.V., and rests upon the observation that <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> are not points or' the compass, but the names of the south-west and north-west winds, and that to look down (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) a wind is the same as looking down a stream. If the harbour looks down the south-west wind it looks toward the north-east, and if it looks down the north-west wind it looks toward the southeast. Its open side would be from northeast to south-east, it would be entirely sheltered on the south-west and north-west side. This is the explanation adopted also by Dean Plumptre. <span class="accented">The south-west wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;</span>, only here in the New Testament, but frequent in classical Greek and in the LXX.

As regards the nautical sense in which St. Luke here uses the word, Dean Howson, in his excellent chapter (23.) on the 'Navigation and Ships of the Ancients,' writes as follows: - "In consequence of the extreme danger to which the ships of the ancients were exposed from leaking, it was customary to take to sea, as part of their ordinary gear, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, undergirders, which were simply ropes for passing round the hull of the ship, and thus preventing the planks from starting;" and he adds in a note that "within the last twenty years (in 1837) marble tables had been dug up in the Piraeus, containing a list of Athenian ships and an inventory of their tackle, and that they all carried, as part of their "hanging gear," <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. Another great ship described by Athenaeus carried twelve such. The operation of undergirding is still occasionally performed, and is called by seamen "frap- ping." The German word is <span class="accented">umgurten</span> (Howson). Among ether recent examples (Howson, p. 33) the <span class="accented">Albion</span> was frapped with iron chains after the battle of Navarino. <span class="cmt_word">Cast upon the Syrtis</span>. The wind was driving them straight toward the Syrtis Major, "the Goodwin Sands of the Mediterranean" (Farrar), and another twenty-four hours of such a gale might bring them there. The Syrtis Major was a wide gulf off the northern coast of Africa, now the Gulf of Sidra, lying between Tunis and Tripoli, considered very dangerous from its rocks and shoals. <span class="accented">Be east upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). The verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is the classical word (Homer, Herodotus, Euripides) for being driven or thrown ashore, and is used in this sense in vers. 26, 29 of this chapter, and in a slightly different sense in ver. 32. <span class="cmt_word">They lowered the gear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is a very common word, variously rendered "goods," "stuff," "vessel," according to the <span class="accented">material</span> to which it is applied (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, etc.). In the LXX. it is used of agricultural implements (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/13-20.htm">1 Samuel 13:20, 21</a>), of weapons of hunting (<a href="../../par/genesis/27-3.htm">Genesis 27:3</a>), of household furniture (<a href="../../par/genesis/31-37.htm">Genesis 31:37</a>), weapons of war (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>), instruments of music (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>). This is the only passage in the Bible where it is used in its technical sense as a nautical term. In classical Greek, when applied generally to ships, it means the whole tackling, sails, ropes, yards, stores, engines, etc. The meaning, of course, is narrowed when applied to some particular part of the ship. Here, on the whole, it seems to mean the "great yard," or, if that had been already lowered, the heavy "head-gear," ropes, pulleys, and the like, which, under the circumstances, would contribute to make the ship roll and be unsteady. The word rendered "lowered" is <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. It is rendered "let down" in <a href="../../par/mark/2-4.htm">Mark 2:4</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4, 5</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>; and ver. 30 of this chapter (A.V.). In the R.V. it is sometimes rendered "let down" and sometimes "lowered." In the LXX. it is used in the sense of "spreading" a sail (<a href="../../par/isaiah/33-23.htm">Isaiah 33:23</a>), which would be equivalent to "let down," if the sails were reefed at the top of the mast; and of "letting down" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>). The R.V., therefore, is correct. The object of what they did was to enable the ship to go as near the wind as possible, and with as little straining and rolling as possible. The operation is called by sailors "lying to." <span class="cmt_word">Were driven</span> (see ver. 15).

The ship in which Josephus was wrecked on his way to Rome, under the procuratorship of Felix (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), carried six hundred souls ('Life,' sect. 3). The ship of Alexandria described by Lucian is calculated to have been of above a thousand tons. The mention of the number brings before us a striking picture of so many persons at St. Paul's bidding, in the midst of so great a danger, taking a cheerful and leisurely meal together, in dependence upon a speedy deliverance promised to them in God s Name. It also adds another vivid touch to the picture of the eye-witness of what he relates. Dean Plumptre well suggests that St. Luke very likely counted the crew on the. occasion of their being all assembled together for the first time.

Meyer and others think it was merely "the ship's provision," and that, considering the number of persons in the ship, and the little consumption during the last fortnight, the weight of what was left would be considerable. They add that the cargo had been already thrown overboard in ver. 18. Others, as Howson, following Smith and Penroso, Farrar, Lewin, and many older commentators, with more reason, understand "the wheat" to mean the ship's cargo from Alexandria to Rome; they think it had been impossible to get at it while the ship was drifting; and that, even had it been possible, it was the last thing they would have recourse to. But now, when it was impossible to save the ship, and the only chance of saving their lives was to run her on the beach, it was an absolute necessity to lighten the ship as much as possible. They therefore cast her freight of Alexandrian corn into the sea, and waited for daylight (see note to ver. 18).

In classical Greek it means to "<span class="accented">take</span> away," "take off," "strip off."

These paddle-rudders had been hoisted up and lashed, lest they should foul the anchors at the stern. But now, when the free use of them was absolutely necessary to steer the ship toward the beach, they unloosed the lashings, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e.</span> "the bands of the rudders," and at the same time they hoisted up the foresail. <span class="cmt_word">The foresail</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, a word found only here in this sense, but used in Vitruvius for a "pulley," and so explained in Ducange.

The explanation of this "place where two seas met" is as follows: - As the ship stood at anchor in the bay on the north-east side of the island, it would have the Koura Point (<span class="accented">Ras el-Kaura</span>) on its left, and on entering deeper into the bay westward, the little island of Salmonetta, or Selmoon, otherwise called Gzeier, would lie on its right, and would appear to be part of the island of Malta, from which it is separated by a narrow channel about a hundred yards in width. When, however, she was just coming upon the beach for which she was making, she would come opposite to this open channel, and the sea from the north would break upon her and meet the sea on the south side of the island, where the ship was. Here, then, <span class="cmt_word">they ran the vessel aground</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to the R.T., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, is only found here in the Bible; but it is the regular word for running a ship aground, or ashore, in classical writers. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> has exactly the same meaning.

And thus ended the eventful voyage of about four hundred and eighty miles (as laid down in the charts) from Clauda to the Point of Koura on the north coast of Malta. It is one of the striking proofs of the identity of Melita with Malta, that the rate at which it is calculated that a large ship laying to in a gale would drift in twenty-four hours, viz. thirty-six miles, multiplied by thirteen and a half (the number of days occupied by the voyage), gives four hundred and eighty-six miles as the whole distance. (36X13.5   =   486) Smith thinks that the coincidence between "the actual bearing of St. Paul's Bay from Clauda, and the direction in which the ship must have driven," with the wind blowing in the quarter we know it did," is, if possible, still more striking" (pp. 127, 128). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/26.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 26"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 26" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../acts/28.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Acts 28"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Acts 28" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/acts/28.htm"><title>Acts 28 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/acts/28.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/acts/28.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/acts/28-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../acts/27.htm" title="Acts 27">&#9668;</a> Acts 28 <a href="../romans/1.htm" title="Romans 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/28-1.htm">Acts 28:1</a></div><div class="verse">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - We for <span class="accented">they</span>, A.V. and T.R.

It was originally colonized by Phoenicians, whether from Tyre or Carthage cannot be pronounced with certainty, though we know it was a Carthaginian possession at the time of the first Punic War. It fell into the hands of the Romans  <span class="date">B.C. 218</span>, and at the time of St. Paul's shipwreck was annexed to the province of Sicily. The population, however, was Phoenician or Punic, and probably knew little Greek or Latin. The name of a fountain in St. Paul's Bay, <span class="accented">Ayn tal Razzul</span>, "The Apostle's Fountain," is said (Smith, p. 24) to be Phoenician. But this is extremely doubtful. It is far more probably, not to say certainly, the corrupt Africano-Arabic dialect of the island, as I venture to affirm on the high authority of Professor Wright. Gesenius is also distinctly of opinion that there are no remains of Phoenician in the Maltese, and that all the words in the Maltese language which have been thought to be Phoenician are really Arabic. Four genuine Phoenician inscriptions have, however, been found in the island ('Monument. Phoenic,' pars prima, pp. 90-111,252, and 341).

Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - "When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood." This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). <span class="cmt_word">A viper came out</span>. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. <span class="accented">Came out.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., "came out through the sticks."

And this is the more remarkable here because there are no fewer than three other medical phrases in this verse, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">be</span>sides those immediately preceding <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (according to several good manuscripts and editions) <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. So that it looks as if, having once got into a medical train of thought from the subject he was writing about, medical language naturally came uppermost in his mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have swollen</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, only here in the Bible, and not found in this sense in older classical writers. But it is the usual medical word for "inflammation" in any part of the body. <span class="cmt_word">Fallen down</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, only here and in <a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a>, and twice in the LXX.; but common in Homer and elsewhere, and especially frequent in medical writers of persons falling down in fits, or weakness, or wounded, or the like. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing amiss</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). Mr. Hobart quotes a remarkable parallel to this phrase from Damocrites, quoted by Galen. He says that whosoever, having been bitten by a mad dog, drinks a certain antidote (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x1fb3;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>), "shall suffer no harm." It is used in medical writers in two senses - of" unusual symptoms," and of fatal consequences. In the New Testament it only occurs elsewhere in <a href="../../par/luke/23-41.htm">Luke 23:41</a>, "Nothing amiss;" and <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:2</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also used in the LXX. for wickedness, doing wickedly, etc. <span class="cmt_word">They changed their minds</span>; as in an opposite direction the Lycaonians did (<a href="../../par/acts/14-11.htm">Acts 14:11, 19</a>). It is a graphic picture of the fickleness of an untutored mind yielding to every impulse. The impunity with which St. Paul endured the bite of the viper was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise in <a href="../../par/mark/16-18.htm">Mark 16:18</a> (see further note on ver. 8).

When the Romans succeeded the Carthaginians in the possession of the island, they would be likely to perpetuate the title of the chief magistrate.

Hence Horace, in the ode just quoted, prays that Castor and Pollux, in conjunction with other deities, would carry the ship in which Virgil sailed safe to Attica. And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons.

Ovid tells us that Minerva was the <span class="accented">tutela</span> of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like.

They were, therefore, obliged to put into Rhegium But after one day the wind became fair (from the south), and on the following day they arrived at Puteoli, having accomplished about one hundred and eighty nautical miles in less than two days" (Smith, p. 156). But Meyer explains it, "after we had come round," viz. from Syracuse, round the eastern coast of Sicily. Lewin thinks they had to stand out to sea to catch the wind, and so arrived at Rhegium by a circuitous course.

Perhaps the name of <span class="accented">Christian</span> was still rather the name given by those without, and that of "brethren," or "disciples," the name used by the Christians among themselves.

'We can trace in the anticipatory form of speech here used by St. Luke, simple as the words are, his deep sense of the transcendent interest of the arrival of the apostle of the Gentiles at the colossal capital of the heathen world. Yes; after all the conspiracies of the Jews who sought to take away his life, after the two years' delay at Caesarea, after the perils of that terrible shipwreck, in spite of the counsel of the soldiers to kill the prisoners, and in spite of the "venomous beast," - Paul came to Rome. The word of God," Thou must bear witness also at Rome" (<a href="../../par/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>), had triumphed over all "the power of the enemy" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>).

During the seven days' stay at Putcoli, the news of the arrival of the illustrious confessors reached the Church at Rome. The writer of that wonderful Epistle which they had received some three years before, and in which he had expressed his earnest desire to visit them, and his hope that he should come to them in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ (<a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11, 12, 15</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/15-22.htm">Romans 15:22, 24, 28-32</a>), was now almost at their gates as a prisoner of state, and they would soon see him face to face. They naturally determined to go and meet him, to honor him as an apostle, and show their love to him as a brother. The younger and more active would go as far as Appii Forum, "a village on the Via Appia, forty-three miles from Rome" (Meyer). The rest only came as far as <span class="cmt_word">The Three Taverns</span>, ten miles nearer to Rome. Alford quotes a passage from Cicero's letters to Atticus (it. 10), in which he mentions both "Appii Forum" and the "Tres Tabernae;" and refers to Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 17. 12:1) for a similar account of Jews at Rome, who, on hearing of the arrival of the pretended Alexander at Puteoli, went out in a body to meet him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x399;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1fc4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).

Appii Forum was not far from the coast, and was a great place for sailors and innkeepers (Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:5, 3). The Via Appia was made by Appius Claudius,  <span class="date">B.C. 442</span>.

There were usually two great officers so called, and it was their special duty to take charge of prisoners sent from the provinces to be tried at Rome. 'Vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii met debet" (Pliny, 'Epist.,' 10:65). It has been argued, from the mention of "the captain of the guard," that Paul's imprisonment must have occurred when Burrus was sole prefect, as related by Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:42, 1), and that hence we get a precise date for it (so Wieseler, 'Chronologic de Apostolisch. Geshichte'). But this can hardly be depended upon. Luke might speak of "the prefect," meaning the one to whom the prisoners were actually committed, just as we might speak of a magistrate writing to "the secretary of state," or an ambassador calling upon "the secretary of state," the matter in hand determining which of the three secretaries we meant. <span class="cmt_word">With the soldier that guarded him</span>.

Nothing can be more delicate, more conciliatory, or more truly patriotic than Paul's manner of addressing the Jews. Himself a Hebrew of the Hebrews, devoted to his kinsmen according to the flesh, never even putting forward his own privilege as a Roman citizen till the last necessity, he shows himself the constant friend of his own people in spite of all their ill usage. Undazzled by the splendor of Rome and the power of the Roman people, his heart is with his own despised nation, "that they might be saved." He wishes to he well with them; he wants them to understand his position; he speaks to them as a kinsman and a brother. His appeal to Caesar had been of necessity - to save his life. But he was not going to accuse his brethren before the dominant race. His first desire was that they should be his friends, and share with him the hope of the gospel of Christ.

(For the <span class="accented">chain</span>, see ver. 16, note, and <a href="../../par/acts/24-23.htm">Acts 24:23</a>.) The force of this saying seems to be this, "I have asked you to come to me because this chain which binds me is not a token of a renegade Israelite who has come to Rome to accuse his nation before the heathen master, but of a faithful Israelite, who has endured bondage rather than forsake the hope of his fathers."

What they meant to say is exactly what the A.V. makes them say, viz. that, neither by special letters, nor by message nor casual information brought by Jews coming to Rome from Judaea, had they heard any harm of him. This seems odd; but as the Jews had no apparent motive for not speaking the truth, we must accept it as true. The expulsion of the Jews from Rome by Claudius (<a href="../../par/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>) may have slackened the intercourse between Judaea and Rome; the attention of the Jews may have been absorbed by their accusation of Felix; there had been a very short interval between Paul's appeal and his departure for Rome; he had only been at Rome three days, and so it is very possible that no report had yet reached Rome concerning him at this early season of the year.

But the most common use of the adverb is by medical writers, who employ it "to denote freedom, unhindered action, in a variety of things, such as respiration, perspiration, the pulse, the muscles, the members of the body" (Hobart). In two passages quoted from Galen ('Meth.

And so ends this lively and beautiful and most faithful sketch of one of the greatest men, and one of the greatest works, the world has ever seen. "In labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft," is seen, as we read this history, to be no empty boast, but a simple statement of the truth. The springs of that mind and of that zeal were ever ready to rise to fresh work, however crushing a strain had been put upon them. "I count not my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God," is the true description of that life as delineated by the beloved physician. And yet how remarkable it is that in the whole of the Acts there is not one single word of panegyric! The portraiture is a bare photograph, without a single additional touch to enhance its beauty. Nor must we forget the singular brevity with which some episodes are passed over. Had we only Luke's history, we should not know that the apostle was an author - an author whose writings have moved the world of mind and spirit more than all the writings of Plato, and Aristotle, and Cicero, and Bacon combined, through a period of eighteen hundred years. Thus, to glance at the "two whole years" with the record of which the book closes, think of the work clone in that time. What gatherings of holy men and women within the walls of that "hired dwelling" are we sure must have taken place! Prisca and Aquila, and Epaenetus, and Mary, and Urban, and Apelles, and Persis, and Hermas, and Olympas, and all their compeers, we may be sure were often there. What wrestlings in prayer, what expositions of the Scriptures, what descriptions of the kingdom of God, what loving exhortations, what sympathetic communings, must have made that "hired dwelling" a very Bethel in the stronghold of heathenism! We think of the praetorian soldiers to whom he was successively chained; perhaps of the courteous Julius; of the inmates of Nero's palace (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-22.htm">Philippians 4:22</a>); perhaps of Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>); of Epaphras and Epaphroditus, and of Luke, and Mark, and Timothy, and Aristarchus, and we know not how many more besides; and there rises before our minds a crowd of agencies and sober activities directed by that master mind to the advancement of the kingdom of God. We feel, indeed, that, though he was chained, "the word of God was not bound;" but that through the marvelous energy and unfailing wisdom of the great prisoner, his prison turned out rather to the furtherance of the gospel. And then we turn to the Epistles written at this time. What a contribution to the literature of the kingdom of heaven!-the Epistles to the Ephesians, to the Colossions, to Philemon, and to the Philippians, and probably much help given to Luke in the composition of the Acts of the Apostles. Truly they were two years of infinite moment to the Church of God. What followed those two years, what became of Paul, and what of his saintly biographer, we shall never know. It has pleased God to draw a curtain ever the events, which we cannot penetrate. Here our history ends, because nothing more had happened when it was given to the Church. Instead of vain regrets because it reaches no further, let us devoutly thank God for all that this book has taught us, and strive to show ourselves worthy members of that Gentile Church, whose foundation by St. Peter and St. Paul, and whose marvelous increment, through the labors of him who once laid it waste, has been so well set before us in the Book of THE ACTS OF THE APOSTLES. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../acts/27.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Acts 27"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Acts 27" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../romans/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Romans 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Romans 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

The idea of the <span class="accented">cloven tongue, i.e.</span> a tongue parted into two, which is thought to have been the origin of the miter, is not suggested either by the Greek or by the circumstances, and is clearly a mistaken one. <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means <span class="accented">distributing themselves</span> or <span class="accented">being distributed.</span> From the central apparition, or rather place of sound, they saw issuing forth many several tongues, looking like small flames of fire, and one such tongue sat upon each one of the brethren or disciples present. <span class="cmt_word">Each one</span>.

For not only must the <span class="accented">all</span> of ver. 1 refer to the same company as was described in the preceding chapter (vers. 15-26), but it is quite clear in ver. 15 of this chapter that Peter and the eleven (ver. 14), standing up separate from the body of the disciples, say of them, "These are not drunken, as ye suppose;" which is a demonstration that those of whom they thus spoke had been speaking with tongues (see also <a href="../../par/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>). St. Augustine, too, says that the hundred and twenty all received the Holy Spirit. To the same effect Meyer, Wordsworth, Alford (who adds, "Not the hundred and twenty only, but all the believers in Christ then congregated at Jerusalem;" so also Lange). Farrar well remarks, "It was the consecration of a whole Church to be all of them a chosen generation, a royal priest- hood, a holy nation, a peculiar people" ('Life of St. Paul,' <a href="../../par/acts/5.htm">Acts 5</a>.). Lange says, "Not only the apostles, but all the disciples, were filled with the Holy Ghost. There is a universal priesthood of all believers, and the Holy Ghost is the anointing which consecrates and qualifies for this priesthood" ('On the Acts,' Clark's edit., p. 67).

St. Paul speaks of them as "the tongues of men and of angels" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>), and as "kinds of tongues" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). His habitual phrase is "speaking in [or <span class="accented">with</span>] <span class="accented">a tongue</span> [or <span class="accented">tongues</span>]" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2, 4-6</a>, etc.), and the verb is always <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, as here. What these tongues were on this occasion we are explicitly informed in vers. 6, 8, and 11. They were the tongues of the various nationalities present at the feast - Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Egyptians, Phrygians, Arabians, etc. This is so clearly and so distinctly stated that it is astonishing that any one should deny it who accepts St. Luke's account as historical. The only room for doubt is whether the speakers spoke in these divers languages, or the hearers heard in them though the speakers spoke in only one tongue. But not to mention that this is far more difficult to imagine, and transfers the miracle from those who had the Holy Spirit to those who had it not, it is against the plain language of the text, which tells us that "they began to speak with other tongues," and that "every man heard them speaking in his own language." "Speaking," said they, "in our own tongues the mighty works of God." There <span class="accented">may</span>, indeed, have been something ecstatic besides in these utterances, but there is no reference to such made either by St. Luke or by the audience whose words he reports. The narrative before us does not hint at any after use of the gift of tongues for missionary purposes. In <a href="../../par/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15-17</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a>, as well as in the passages above referred to in the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the speaking with tongues is always spoken of - often in connection with prophecy - simply as a gift and a manifestation (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7</a>) of the power of the Holy Spirit. In this case and in <a href="../../par/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a> the subject-matter of the utterance is the greatness of God's works; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>. In <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2</a> it is" mysteries;" in ver. 15, "prayers and psalms;" in ver. 16 it is "blessing" and "thanksgiving" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). But nowhere, either in Holy Scripture or in the Fathers of the three first centuries, is the gift of tongues spoken of in connection with preaching to foreign nations (see Alford's just remarks). Farrar ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 98-101) takes the same view, but is much less distinct in his conception of what is meant here by speaking with tongues. He adheres to the view of Schneckenburger, that "the tongue was, from its own force and significance, intelligible equally to all who heard it;" he agrees with the dictum of Neander that "any foreign languages which were spoken on this occasion were only something accidental, and not the essential element of the language of the Spirit." He says, "The voice they uttered was awful in its range, in its tones, in its modulations, in its startling, penetrating, almost appalling power; the words they spoke were exalted, intense, passionate, full of mystic significance; the language they used was not their ordinary and familiar tongue, but was Hebrew, or Greek, or Latin, or Aramaic, or Persian, or Arabic, as some overpowering and unconscious impulse of the moment might direct... and among these strange sounds... there were some which none could interpret, which rang on the air like the voice of barbarous languages, and which ... conveyed no definite significance beyond the fact that they were reverberations of one and the same ecstasy." The writer seems to suggest that when any real language was spoken it was one more or less known previously by the speaker, and that in other cases it was no language at all, only thrilling emotional sounds. Renan's view of the day of Pentecost is a carious specimen of rationalistic interpretation. "One day when the brethren were come together there was a tempest. A violent wind burst open the windows, and the sky was one sheet of fire. In that climate tempests are often accompanied by an extraordinary amount of electric light. The atmosphere is on all sides furrowed with jets of flame. On this occasion, whether the electric fluid actually passed through the room, or whether the faces of all present were suddenly lit up by an extremely bright flash of lightning, all were convinced that the Holy Spirit had entered their assembly, and had sat upon the head of each in the shape of a tongue of fire... In these moments of ecstasy, the disciple possessed by the Spirit uttered sounds 'inarticulate and incoherent, which the hearers fancied were the words of a strange language, and in their simplicity tried to interpret They listened eagerly to the medley of sounds, and explained them by their own extemporaneous thoughts. Each of them had recourse to his own native <span class="accented">patois</span> to supply some meaning to the unintelligible accents, and generally succeeded in affixing to them the thoughts that were uppermost in his own mind" ('Les Apotres,' pp. 66-68). Elsewhere (pp. 64, 65) he suggests that the whole conception of <span class="accented">speaking with tongues</span> arose from the anticipation on the part of the apostles that great difficulty would arise in propagating the gospel from the impossibility of learning to speak the necessary languages. The solution with some was that, under the ecstasy caused by the Holy Spirit, the hearers would be able to translate what they heard into their own tongue; others rather thought that by the same power the apostles would be able to speak any dialect they pleased at the moment. Hence the conception of the day of Pentecost as described by St. Luke! Meyer, again, fully admits, as "beyond all doubt," that St. Luke intended to narrate that the persons possessed by the Spirit spoke in foreign languages previously unknown by them; but adds that "the sudden communication of a facility of speaking foreign languages is neither logically possible nor psychologically and morally conceivable" (a pretty bold assertion); and therefore he sets down St. Luke's account of what occurred as "a later legendary formation," based upon the existing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.  Zeller, traveling a little further on the same road, comes to the conclusion that "the narrative before us is not based on any definite fact" (p. 205). Leaving, however, these fanciful varieties of incredulous criticism, and interpreting the statements of this chapter by the later spiritual gifts as seen in the Church of Corinth, we conclude that the" tongues" were sometimes "tongues of men," foreign languages unknown to the speakers, and of course unintelligible to the hearers unless any were present, as was the case on the day of Pentecost, who knew the language; and sometimes languages not of earth but of heaven, "<span class="accented">tongues</span> of angels." But there is no evidence whatever of their being mere gibberish as distinct from <span class="accented">language</span>, or being language coined at the moment by the Holy Ghost. All that St. Paul says to the Corinthians is fully applicable to any language spoken when there were none present who understood it. The significance of the miracle seems to be that it points to the time when all shall be one in Christ, and shall all speak and understand the same speech; and not only all men, but men and angels, "<span class="accented">the</span> whole family in heaven and earth," "<span class="accented">things</span> in the heavens and things upon the earth" all gathered together in one in Christ. It may also not improbably have been used occasionally, as it was on the day of Pentecost, to convey doctrine, knowledge, or exhortation, to foreign people; but there is no distinct evidence that this was the case.

Observe the distinct reference to the miracles of Christ, as the proofs that he came from God, the authenticating evidences of his Divine mission. So St. Peter again, in his address to Cornelius, declares how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him (<a href="../../par/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>).

"Miracles, wonders, and signs" occur together in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-12.htm">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>.

So we read <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>, "Through [or 'by'] whom also he made the worlds." And so our Lord said of himself, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;" and "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do" (<a href="../../par/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17, 19</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).

As Mediator, Christ did all things by his Father's appointment, and for his Father's glory, Even as ye yours, elves know. Mark the confidence with which Peter appeals to their personal knowledge of the miracles of Christ. This was a fitting preparation for the announcement of that mighty power, wonder, and sign which he was now about to proclaim to them - the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/2-25.htm">Acts 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> <span class="accented">- Saith</span> for <span class="accented">speaketh</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">he</span> <span class="accented">held</span> for <span class="accented">foresaw</span>, A.V. The sixteenth psalm is ascribed to David in the title prefixed to it in the Hebrew and the LXX. Without pronouncing the titles to be infallible, we must confess that they carry great weight with them in the absence of any strong internal evidence against them. Meyer speaks of the psalm as "certainly later than David," and Ewald and others ascribe it to the time of the Captivity; but Hitzig thinks the internal evidence is in favor of its belonging to the time before David ascended the throne ('Speaker's Commentary'). We may safely rest on the authority of St. Peter here and St. Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35, 36</a>), and be satisfied that it is really David's. The manner in which it is quoted by the two apostles is also very strong evidence that by the Jews of that day it was generally admitted to be a Messianic psalm. The following quotation is verbatim from the LXX.

The "hell" of the A.V. is the exact English representative of <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>.

In the A.V. it is rendered <span class="accented">corruption</span>, here and in <a href="../../par/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where it answers to "the worms," in the parallel clause. It is very probable that the LXX. are right. Nothing is more common than for Hebrew verbs to take the meaning of verbs with similar radicals. <span class="cmt_word">Holy One</span>. So the LXX. and the Keri of the Hebrew text. But the Cethib has <span class="accented">Holy Ones</span> in the plural. It is obvious that the singular, <span class="accented">Holy One</span>, agrees far better with the singulars which precede and follow <span class="accented">it - my</span> heart, <span class="accented">my</span> glory, <span class="accented">my</span> flesh, <span class="accented">my</span> soul, thou wilt show me - than the plural, which is entirely out of place.

It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang. Abraham was the head of the whole Hebrew race: "Abraham our father." The twelve patriarchs were the heads of their respective tribes. The LXX. use the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "chief of the fathers' houses" (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12</a>); which they elsewhere render by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>, etc.). In common parlance, the term is also applied to those chief persons who lived before the time of Moses, and have their record in his books. <span class="cmt_word">His tomb is with us</span>, etc. Josephus speaks of David's tomb (calling it, as St. Peter here does, his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) as consisting of several chambers, and relates how one of these chambers was opened by the high priest Hyrcanus, who took from it three thousand talents of gold to give to Antiochus Pins, who was at that time laying siege to Jerusalem. He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed. He further mentions that Herod, having been terrified by the bursting out of flames, which stopped his further progress, built a most costly marble monument at the entrance of the tomb ('Jud. Ant.,' 7. 15:3; 13. 8:4; 16. 7:1). For the sense, supply "and therefore he could not be speaking of himself." The explanation follows that he was a prophet, etc.

Thy throne shall be established forever;" and in ver. 28, David speaks of it as God's promise: "Thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant." But there is no mention there of an oath. But in <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, great stress is laid upon God having sworn to David: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (vers. 3, 4); and again, ver. 35, "Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David" <a href="../../par/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a>, should be read through carefully (comp. also <a href="../../par/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/13-23.htm">Acts 13:23</a>).

But it is equally clear that he is but one of the apostles; he is not set over them, but acts with them; he is not their superior, but their fellow; they are not eclipsed by his presence, but only animated by his example; inquirers after salvation do not ask at his mouth only, but of the whole college of the apostles.

It is very remarkable that at this early age of the Church's existence Christians did not deem themselves separated from their Jewish brethren, or from the Old Testament institutions. Christianity was but Judaism perfected; the gospel the full blossoming of the Law. The first Christian Jews, therefore, did not conceive of themselves as quitting the religion of their fathers, but rather hoped that their whole nation would in a short time acknowledge Jesus to be the Christ. Christian institutions, therefore - the prayers, the breaking of bread, the prophesyings and speaking with tongues, and the apostolic teachings - were supplemental to the temple service, not antagonistic to it; and the church took the place rather of the synagogue than of the temple (see 'Dict. of Bible:' "Synagogue"). <span class="cmt_word">At home.</span> This version hardly represents the true idea of the original; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> represents the private Christian place of meeting, as contrasted with the temple. The meaning is not that every disciple broke bread in his own house, but that they broke bread at the house where the Christian assemblies were held, whether one or more. We have already seen the Church gathered together "in an upper room" (<a href="../../par/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>), in "one place," in "a house" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1, 2</a>), and "together" (ver. 44; see too <a href="../../par/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>); and we know that as the synagogue was called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, house of prayer, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>, the house of assemblage, so the Christian place of meeting was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; the Lord's house, whence the word "<span class="accented">church."</span> (For <span class="accented">breaking bread, see</span> above, ver. 42.)

Peter and John. The close friendship of these two apostles is remarkable. The origin of it appears to have been their partnership in the fishing-boats in which they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. For St. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were "partners with Simon," and helped him to take the miraculous draught of fishes (<a href="../../par/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (see also <a href="../../par/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>). But the yet closer friendship of Peter and John first appears in their going together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the betrayal (<a href="../../par/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a>), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="../../par/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2-4</a>), and yet again in <a href="../../par/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20, 21</a>. It is in strict and natural sequence to these indications in the Gospel that, on opening the first chapters of the Acts, we find Peter and John constantly acting together in the very van of the Christian army (see <a href="../../par/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1, 3, 11</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour of prayer</span>; called in <a href="../../par/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>, "the hour of incense," that is, the hour of the evening sacrifice, when the people stood outside in prayer, while the priest within offered the sacrifice and burnt the incense (see <a href="../../par/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, note). Hence the comparison in <a href="../../par/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice."

Perhaps the lame man leant against one of the open doors. <span class="cmt_word">Which is called Beautiful</span>. It is not certain what gate this was. In the 'Dictionary of the Bible' it is described as "the great eastern gate leading from the court of the women to the upper court," following apparently Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 5. 5:3. But it is impossible to reconcile Josephus's two accounts - that in the 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:05. and that in 'Ant. Jud.,' 15. 11. In the former he says distinctly that there were ten gates - four on the north, four on the south, and two on the east. In the latter he says there were three gates on the north, three on the south, and one on the east. In the former he says that fifteen steps led up <span class="accented">from</span> the women's enclosure to the great gate, exactly opposite the gate of the temple itself (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); in the latter he says very distinctly that women were allowed to enter through the great gate on the east. With such discrepancies in the description of the only eye-witness whose evidence has been preserved, it is impossible to speak with certainly. But it seems probable that there were two gates on the east - one the beautiful and costly gate of Corinthian brass, elaborately described by Josephus, through which the women did pass; the other the greater gate, just opposite to and above the beautiful gate (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), leading from the court of the women to the inner court; and that Josephus has confounded one with the other in his descriptions. Anyhow, the beautiful gate was probably on the east. Its correct name is said to be the gate of Nicanor. <span class="cmt_word">The temple</span>. It must be remembered that the whole platform, including the porches, and the courts of the Gentiles and of the women, and the outer court and the court of the priests, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>; the actual house was called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; that part of the <span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> to which only Israelites were admitted, was called <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f05;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>.

Barabbas was a murderer, one who took away human life for his own base ends; the other was the Prince and Author of life, who was come into the world, not to destroy men's lives, but to save them. This title, taken in connection with the preceding declaration, "God hath glorified his Servant Jesus," seems almost to be a reminiscence of our Savior's prayer," Father,...  glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him" (<a href="../../par/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1, 2</a>). Jesus himself in very many places dwells upon his own great prerogative of giving life: "I am come that they might have life, and.., have it more abundantly" (<a href="../../par/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>); "I am that Bread of life;" "I am the living Bread ... if any man cat of this bread, he shall live for ever;" "I give... my flesh for the life of the world;" "Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life;" "They that hear shall live;" "As the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;" "The Son of man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should...  have eternal life;" "The water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life."

In the same spirit we read that the lame man "praised God" (vers. 8, 9) for the cure effected through the Name of Jesus Christ; and Peter says (ver. 15), "Whom God raised from the <span class="accented">dead."</span> The interpretation of the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> depends upon whether we supply an active or a passive word. The faith which <span class="accented">acts</span>, or <span class="accented">works</span>, or <span class="accented">moves</span> through him is one way of understanding it; the faith which <span class="accented">is wrought</span> or <span class="accented">produced</span> through him is the other.

If so, the time of restoration is not exactly synchronous with the times of refreshing, but preparatory to them; preparatory, too, to that restoration of the kingdom to Israel of which the apostles spake to the Lord (<a href="../../par/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>). Probably, however, St. Peter includes in his view the immediately following times of" the presence of the Lord," just as in St. Mark (<a href="../../par/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>) the preparatory mission of John the Baptist is included in the phrase, "The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ." <span class="cmt_word">Whereof God spake</span>.

St. Peter here teaches that that prophet was none other than Christ himself, who was like unto Moses in the fullness of the revelation given unto him, in his being a Mediator between God and the people, in being the Author of a new law - the law of faith and love, in building a new tabernacle for God to inhabit, even the Church in which he will dwell for ever and ever (see <a href="../../par/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>).

He also mentions the captain of the temple ('Bell. Jud.,' 6, 5:3) at the time of the destruction of the temple. There can be little doubt, therefore, that the captain of the temple here spoken of was a priest who had under him the Levitical guard, and whose duty it was to keep order in the temple courts in these turbulent times, lie appears from <a href="../../par/acts/5-25.htm">Acts 5:25, 26</a>, <a href="../../par/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4</a>, 52, and the passages in Josephus, to have been an officer of high rank.

It is possible, however, that Annas may have continued to be president of the Sanhedrim, and be called high priest, even when not actually so. He seems to have lived to old age. He is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant.

St. Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/23-1.htm">Luke 23:1-12</a>) is the only one of the evangelists who records the part taken by Herod in conjunction with Pontius Pilate in the condemnation of Christ.

The only other place in the New Testament where the word (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) occurs is in <a href="../../par/luke/1-25.htm">Luke 1:25</a>, where the Lord "looked upon" Elisabeth to confer a blessing upon her. In <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/24-22.htm">2 Chronicles 24:22</a>, "The Lord look upon it and require it," the LXX have the simple verb <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. It is beautiful to notice how, in the heat of the unjust persecutions, the Church hands over her quarrel to her Lord, and is only careful that she be not stopped in her work by the threatenings of her enemies. <span class="cmt_word">To speak thy word with all boldness</span> (for the word "boldness," see ver. 13, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-30.htm">Acts 4:30</a></div><div class="verse">By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - While <span class="accented">thou stretchest</span> for <span class="accented">by stretching</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">thy</span> for <span class="accented">thine</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">Servant</span> for <span class="accented">child</span>, A.V., as in ver. 27 and <a href="../../par/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13, 26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">While thou stretchest</span>, etc. The A.V. seems preferable. It was the fact that, while they preached the Word of God, the Lord confirmed the Word with <span class="accented">signs</span> following, which gave them such superhuman courage to persevere in the face of death and bonds. And this was God s method and means of encouraging them. <span class="cmt_word">And that signs and wonders may be done.</span> But this clause is better rendered, as Beza and Bengel render it, in dependence upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">and by signs and wonders being done</span>, as the consequence of the stretching out of the hand of Jesus. The other ways of construing the sentence are either to make the clause, "that signs and wonders may be done," dependent upon "grant," which seems to be the meaning of the A.V., or else to take it, as Meyer does, as an independent clause, expressing the aim of the stretching out of the hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a></div><div class="verse">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> <span class="accented">- Wherein they were gathered</span> for <span class="accented">when they were assembled</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When they had prayed</span>.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is properly used of ships or of the sea agitated and tossed by the wind; so <a href="../../par/matthew/11-7.htm">Matthew 11:7</a>, "A reed shaken by the wind." But it is also applied to the rocking caused by an earthquake (<a href="../../par/acts/16-26.htm">Acts 16:26</a>), which maybe the kind of shaking here meant. In this fresh outpouring or the Spirit, whereby they were enabled to <span class="cmt_word">speak the word of God with boldness</span>, they had a direct and immediate answer to their prayer (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/65-24.htm">Isaiah 65:24</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32</a></div><div class="verse">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any <i>of them</i> that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">- Soul</span> for <span class="accented">of one soul</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and not one of them said</span> for <span class="accented">neither said any of them</span>, A.V. The great increase in the number of believers had been recorded in ver. 4. And the state of public feeling alluded to in ver. 21 makes it likely that yet more may have been converted to the faith. This was very important, no doubt; but it was scarcely less so that this great multitude were one in heart and soul, closely united in the bonds of Christian fellowship and love. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-33.htm">Acts 4:33</a></div><div class="verse">And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> <span class="accented">- Their witness</span> for <span class="accented">witness</span>, A.V.

It was one of their chief functions as apostles to bear witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus (see <a href="../../par/acts/1-22.htm">Acts 1:22</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Great grace</span>, etc. Some understand this of the singular favor with which the people regarded them. But it is better to take it of the grace of God which abounded towards them in spiritual gifts and abundant unction and rich blessing, crowning their labors with success. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34</a></div><div class="verse">Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - For <span class="accented">neither</span> for <span class="accented">neither</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">among them any</span> for <span class="accented">any among them</span>, A.V. One striking proof of the greatness of the Divine grace that was upon the Church at this time was that there was no such thing as want or poverty among them. The equality typified in the daily collection of manna was literally fulfilled among them (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/8-14.htm">2 Corinthians 8:14, 15</a>); for the rich sold their houses and lands, and laid the price of them at the apostles' feet, to be used for the common wants. The present participle in the Greek (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) indicates the process as continuing (Meyer).

A significant token of the place occupied by the apostles (as later by the bishops of the Church) as the trustees and dispensers of the Church's funds as well as of the Church's doctrines. Compare "Ante pedes praetoris in fore expensum est auri pondo centum" (Cie. pp. Flacco, quoted by Alford). We have, too, here an instance of the way in which Church institutions rose gradually as occasion gave birth to them. So the institution of deacons (<a href="../../par/acts/6-2.htm">Acts 6:2, 3</a>), of presbyters or priests (<a href="../../par/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>), of bishops (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1-3</a>.), of Confirmation (<a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14-17</a>), appear to have come about in each case <span class="accented">pro re nata.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a></div><div class="verse">And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, <i>and</i> of the country of Cyprus,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> <span class="accented">- Joseph</span> for <span class="accented">Joses</span>, A.V., as <a href="../../par/acts/1-23.htm">Acts 1:23</a>; <span class="accented">Son of exhortation</span> for <span class="accented">The son of consolation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">a man of Cyprus by race</span> for <span class="accented">and of the country of Cyprus</span>, A.V. Joseph. In the variation of manuscripts it is difficult to say which is right. Some (Grotius, Alford, etc.) consider the two forms as mere variations in writing the name <span class="accented">Joseph.</span> But it seems more probable that <span class="accented">Joses</span> is the same name as <span class="accented">Josiah</span>, only without the addition of the Divine Name (Jab) at the end (see Simon, 'Onomast.'). It is found as a proper name in the T.R. of <a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 47</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> (Jose); and is not likely to have been substituted for the common name of Joseph. The Codex Sinaiticus has <span class="accented">Joses</span> only in <a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>. The R.V. has <span class="accented">Joseph</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>, and <span class="accented">Joses</span> in <a href="../../par/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/6-3.htm">Mark 6:3</a>; <a href="../../par/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40, 47</a>. In <a href="../../par/luke/3-29.htm">Luke 3:29</a> the R.V. has <span class="accented">Jesus.</span> But <span class="accented">Joses</span> is probably right both here and in the above-cited passages. <span class="cmt_word">Barnabas</span>; literally, <span class="accented">son of prophecy</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a prophet, as he is called in <a href="../../par/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a>. Probably his exhortations under the influence of the Holy Spirit in the Church assemblies were particularly stirring and edifying. The Greek version of the name, <span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, should be rendered, as in R.V., <span class="cmt_word">Son of exhortation</span>, for "son of consolation? is a meaning which can hardly be got out of the Hebrew. The apostles seem here to have followed our Lord's example in naming the sons of Zebedee, sons of thunder. <span class="cmt_word">A man of Cyprus by race</span>. The A.V. is less accurate, but it gives the sense better. Cyprus was the country where he was born and lived, as, it is likely, his fathers had done before him. But he was hardly, in our sense of the words, a Cypriot by race. We know that a great many Jews were settled in Cyprus (Philo, 'Leg. ad Caium.,'&sect; 36; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 13:4; Alford, on <a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and we learn from <a href="../../par/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a> that in Salamis alone there were several synagogues.

The one that Christianity at its beginnings was mightily helped and advanced by miracles done in the Name of Jesus Christ. The other that the authority of the apostles as the rulers of the Church was greatly strengthened by these miracles being wrought exclusively by their hands. We cannot understand either the external relations of the Church to the world, or the internal relations of the people to their spiritual rulers, unless we duly take count of these two things. <span class="cmt_word">With one accord</span> (see <a href="../../par/acts/4-24.htm">Acts 4:24</a>, note).

St. Luke had mentioned (<a href="../../par/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a> and Acts 5:17) that there was an influential party of Sadducees in the Sanhedrim. He, therefore, now specially notes that Gamaliel was a Pharisee. There can be no doubt that this alone would rather dispose him to resist the violent counsels of the Sadducean members, and the more so as the doctrine of the Resurrection was in question (see <a href="../../par/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6-8</a>). Moreover, Gamaliel was noted for his moderation. That <span class="accented">Gamaliel</span> here named is the same as that of <a href="../../par/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>, at whose feet St. Paul was brought up at Jerusalem, and who is known in the Talmud as Rabban Gamaliel the elder (to distinguish him from his grandson of the same name, the younger), the grandson of Hillel, the head of the school of Hillel, and at some time president of the Sanhedrim, one of the most famous of the Jewish doctors (as the title <span class="accented">Rabban</span>, borne by only six others, shows), seems certain, though it cannot absolutely be proved. The description of him as <span class="cmt_word">a doctor of the law, had in honor of all the people;</span> the allusion to him as a great teacher, learned in the perfect manner of the Law of the fathers, and one whose greatness would be as a shield to his pupils, in <a href="../../par/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; the exact chronological agreement; the weight he possessed in the Sanhedrim, in spite of the Sadducean tendencies of the high priest and his followers; and the agreement between his character as written in the Talmud and as shown in his speech and in the counsel given in it, seem to place his identity beyond all reasonable doubt. There does not seem to be any foundation for the legend in the Clementine Recognitions, that he was in secret a Christian. If the prayer used in the synagogues, "Let there be no hope to them that apostatize from the true religion; and let heretics, how many soever they he, all perish as in a moment," be really his composition, as the Jews say, he certainly had no inclination to Christianity ('Prid.

A very serious chronological difficulty arises hero. The only Theudas known to history is the one about whom Josephus writes ('Ant. Jud.,' 20:5), quoted in full by Eusebius ('Ecclesiastes Hist.,'2:11) as having pretended to be a prophet, having lured a number of people to follow him to the banks of the Jordan, by the assurance that he would part the waters of the river, and as having been pursued by order of Cuspius Fadus, the Procurator of Judaea, when numbers of his followers were slain and taken prisoners, and Theudas himself had his head cut off. But Fadus was procurator in the reign of Claudius Caesar, immediately after the death of King Agrippa, ten or twelve years after the time when Gamaliel was speaking, and about thirty years after the time at which Gamaliel places Theudas. Assuming St. Luke to be as accurate and correct here as he has been proved to be in other instances where his historical accuracy has been impugned, three ways present themselves of explaining the discrepancy. 1. Josephus may have misplaced the adventure of Theudas by some accidental error. Considering the vast number of Jewish insurrections from the death of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem, such a mistake is not very improbable. 2. There may have been two adventurers of the name of Theudas, one in the reign of Augustus Caesar, and the other in the reign of Claudius; and so both the historians may be right, and the apparent discrepancy may have no real existence (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). 3. The person named Theudas by Gamaliel may be the same whom Josephus speaks of ('Bell. Jud.,' it. 4:2) by the common name of Simon, as gathering a band of robbers around him, and making himself king at Herod's death ('Sonntag,' cited by Meyer, etc.). But he was killed by Gratus, and the insurrection suppressed. A variety in this last mode has also been suggested (Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia'), viz. to understand Theudas to be an Aramaic form of Theodotus, and the equivalent Hebrew form of Theodotus to be <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, Matthias, and so the person meant by <span class="accented">Theudas</span> to be a certain <span class="accented">Matthias</span> who with one Judas made an insurrection, when Herod the Great was dying, by tearing down the golden eagle which Herod had put over the great gate of the temple, and who was burnt alive with his companions, after defending his deed in a speech of great boldness and constancy ('Ant. Jud' 17:6). A consideration of these methods of explaining the apparent contradiction between the two historians shows that no certainty can without further light be arrived at. But it may be observed that it is quite impossible to suppose that any one so well informed and so accurate as St. Luke is could imagine that an event that he must have remembered perfectly, if it happened under the procuratorship of Fadus, had happened before the disturbances caused by Judas of Galilee, at least thirty years before. But it is most certain that Josephus's account of Theudas agrees better with Gamaliel's notice than that of either of the other persons suggested, irrespective of the identity of name. The first way of explaining the difficulty above proposed has, therefore, most probability in it. But some further corroboration of this explanation may be found in some of the details of Theudas's proceedings given by Josephus. He tells us that Theudes persuaded a great number of people to "collect all their possessions" and follow him to the banks of the Jordan, where he promised, like a second Elijah, to part the waters for them to pass over; that they did so, but that Fadus sent a troop of horse after them, who slew numbers of them, and amongst them their leader. Now, if this happened when the business of the census was beginning to be agitated, after the deposition of Archelaus (A.D. 6 or 7), all is plain. Theudas declaimed as a prophet against submitting to the census of their goods ordered by Augustus. The people were of the same mind. Theudas persuaded them that, if they brought all their goods to the banks of the Jordan, he would divide the stream and enable them to carry them over to the other side out of reach of the tax-gatherer. And so they made the attempt. But this was an act of rebellion against the Roman power, and a method of defeating the purpose of the census, which must be crushed at once. And so the people were pursued and slaughtered. But apart from the census of their goods, one sees no motive either for the attempt to carry away their property, or for the slaughter of an unarmed multitude by the Roman cavalry. So that the internal evidence is in favor of St. Luke's collocation of the incident, at the same time that his authority as a contemporary historian is much higher than that of Josephus. Still, one desiderates some more satisfactory proof of the error of Josephus, and some account of how he fell into it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a></div><div class="verse">After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, <i>even</i> as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37</span> <span class="accented">- Enrolment</span> for <span class="accented">taxing</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">some of the</span> for <span class="accented">much</span>, A.V.; as many for <span class="accented">even as many</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">scattered abroad</span> for <span class="accented">dispersed</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Judas of Galilee</span>, otherwise called the <span class="accented">Gaulonite</span>, as a native of Gamala, in Gaulonitis.

He was the great leader of the Jews in opposing the census ordered by Augustus, after the deposition of Archelaus, and carried out by Cyrenius, or rather P. Sulpicius Quirinus, the Propraetor of Syria, with the assistance of Cumanus, the subordinate Governor of Judaea. Judas, with Zadoc his coadjutor, was the founder of a fourth Jewish sect, nearly allied to the Pharisees, and his sedition was founded on his philosophic tenets. Josephus speaks of him as the author of all the seditions, tumults, slaughters, sieges, devastations, plunder, famines, ending with the burning of the temple, which afflicted his unhappy country. He gives no account of his death. But his two sons, James and Simon, were crucified by Tiberius Alexander, the successor of Cuspius Fadus. Another son, Menahem, having collected and armed a large band of robbers and other insurgents, after a partially successful attack on the Roman camp at Jerusalem, was miserably slain. The enrolment (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>, as <a href="../../par/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1</a>). The purpose of Augustus, which had been delayed some years from causes not accurately known, perhaps in deference to some remonstrance from Herod the Great, was now carried into effect. Quirinus was sent, apparently the second time, as Proprsetor of Syria, to which Judaea was now attached, with Cumanus under him as Procurator of Judaea, to make a valuation of all their property. The Jews had been first persuaded by the high priest Joazar, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> apparently in the end of Herod's reign, or the beginning of Archelaus's, to submit to what they greatly disliked, but were now roused to insurrection by Judas of Galilee ('Ant.,' 18, 1:1). <span class="cmt_word">He also perished</span>. Nothing is known of his death beyond this notice of it. Scattered abroad. Not crushed, for the insurrection broke out again and again, having the character of a religious war given to it by Judas of Galilee.

From seven having been the number of the first deacons arose the custom in some Churches of always having seven deacons, which continued some centuries in the Church of Rome. One of the Canons of the Council of Neo-caesarea (An). 314) enacted that "there ought to be but seven deacons in any city," and St. Mark is said to have ordained seven deacons at Alexandria (see Bingham, 'Christ.

They are thought to consist chiefly of the descendants of the Jews who were taken prisoners by Pompey, and deported to Rome, who were afterwards emancipated and returned to Judaea, though some (Meyer, 1:1) settled in Rome. Tacitus, under the year A.D. , speaks of four thousand Libertini, infected with Jewish or Egyptian superstitions, as banished to Sardinia ('Annal.,' 2. 85.). Many of these must have been Jews. Josephus, who tells the same story as Tacitus, though somewhat differently, says they were all Jews ('Ant. Jud.,' 18, 3:5). <span class="cmt_word">The Cyrenians</span>. Cyrene was the chief city in North Africa, and a great Jewish colony. Numbers of Jews were settled there in the time of Ptolemy Lagus ('Cont.

Agrippa, confirming to the Jews of Cyrene the right to live according to their own laws, and specially to send money for the temple at Jerusalem (16. 6:5). Jews from "the parts of Libya about Cyrene" are mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; Simon, who bore our Savior's cross, was "a man of Cyreue;" there were "men of Cyrene" at Jerusalem at the time of the persecution that arose about Stephen (<a href="../../par/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>); and "Lucius of Cyrene" is mentioned in <a href="../../par/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>. It was natural, therefore, that the Cyrenians should have a synagogue of their own at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Alexandrians</span>. Alexandria had a Jewish population of 100,000 at this time, equal to two-fifths of the whole city. The famous Philo, who was in middle age at this time, was an Alexandrian, and the Alexandrian Jews were the most learned of their race. The Jews settled in Alexandria in the time of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Lagus. The LXX. Version of the Scriptures was made at Alexandria primarily for their use. We may be sure, therefore, that they had a synagogue at Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">And of them of Cilicia</span>. The transition from the African Jews to those of Asia is marked by changing the form of phrase into <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x2e;</span> There were many Jews in Cilicia, and this doubtless influenced St. Paul in preaching there, as well as the fact of its being his own native province (see <a href="../../par/acts/15-23.htm">Acts 15:23, 41</a>; <a href="../../par/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>). Josephus makes frequent mention of the Jews in the wars between the Ptolemies and Antiochus the Great, with whom the Jews sided, and in consequence were much favored by him. And it is thought that many who had been driven out from their homes by the wars, and others who were brought by him from Babylonia, settled in his time in Cilicia, as well as other parts of his Asiatic dominions. Seleucus also encouraged the Jews to settle in the towns of Asia in his kingdom, by giving them the freedom of the cities and putting them on an equal footing (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) with Macedonians and Greeks ('Ant. Jud.,' 12. 3:1, 3). <span class="cmt_word">Asia</span>; meaning the same district as in <a href="../../par/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a> (where see note). Evidence of the abundance of Jews in Asia crops up throughout the Acts (8. 16, 24, 42, 45; 14:19; 16:13; 18:26, 28; 19:17; 20:21). That the Jews of Asia were very bigoted we learn from <a href="../../par/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a> (see also <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-1.htm">1 Peter 1:1</a>).

He adds "and fathers" out of respect to the elder and more dignified portion of the Sanhedrim. It seems probable that Stephen, as a Hellenist Jew, spoke in Greek, which is borne out by the quotations being from the LXX. (see Alford), though Meyer and others think he spoke in Hebrew. Greek was generally understood at this time by all educated persons (see Roberts, 'Discussions on Gospels,' <a href="../../par/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>. - 7.). The speech itself is almost universally admitted to bear strong internal marks of genuineness and originality. But different estimates have been formed of its excellence, and different explanations given of its scope and object. Difficult but striking; long and prolix;" "at first sight absurd and out of place;" "wonderful but difficult;" "of inestimable value;" "a speech containing many things which don't seem much to the point;" "a powerful speech;" a speech combining "the address of the advocate and the boldness of the martyr;" - are some of the estimates that have been formed of it by modern commentators. As regards its scope and object, the two main clues to it are the accusation which Stephen rose to rebut, and the application with which he ended in vers. 51-53. If we keep these two things steadily in view, we shall not be very far wrong if we say that Stephen sought to clear himself by showing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by his historical summary, what a true and thorough Israelite he was in heart and feeling and fellowship with the fathers of his race, and therefore how unlikely to speak blasphemous words against either Moses or the temple; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> how Moses himself had foretold the coming of Christ as a prophet like himself, to enunciate some new doctrines; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> how at every stage of their history their fathers had resisted those who were sent to them by God, and that now his judges were playing the same part. Perhaps it may be further true, as Chrysostom explains it (Hom. 15, 16, 17.), that his intention in the early part of the speech was to show "that the promise was made before the place, before circumcision, before sacrifice, before the temple," in accordance with St. Paul's argument (<a href="../../par/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16-18</a>); and that therefore the blessings of the Abrahamic covenant could not be dependent upon the Law or the temple. <span class="cmt_word">The God of glory</span>. This unusual phrase identifies God, of whom Stephen speaks, with the God whose visible glory was seen by the patriarchs (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-2.htm">Genesis 26:2</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16, 17</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-19.htm">Numbers 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-41.htm">John 12:41</a>). St. Paul uses a similar phrase, "The Lord of glory '(<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>). Our father. He thus identifies himself with his judges, whom he had just called "brethren." In <span class="cmt_word">Mesopotamia</span>, which would be in Hebrew "Aram of the two rivers." The exact place, as we learn from <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, was "Ur of the Chaldees;" whence the Israelites were taught to say (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/26-5.htm">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>), "An Aramcan ready to perish was my father." That this appearance was in Ur, <span class="cmt_word">before he dwelt in Haran</span>, is manifest from <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>, because it is there said that they went forth from Ur "to go into the land of Canaan," which makes it quite certain that the appearance of God to Abraham had preceded their leaving Ur, and was the cause of it. And this is confirmed by <a href="../../par/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a>; <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-7.htm">Nehemiah 9:7</a>; and Josephus ('Ant.,' 1. 7:1). Moreover, the very language of the call shows plainly that it came to him when he was living in his native country, among his kindred, and in his father's house, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at Ur, not in Haran, where they were only sojourners. There is nothing the least unusual, in Hebrew narrative, in the writer going back to any point in the preceding narrative with which the subsequent narrative is connected. <a href="../../par/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12</a>. I precedes in point of time <a href="../../par/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>; similar examples are <a href="../../par/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> compared with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20, 21</a>, compared with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a>; and many more. It is, however, of course possible that a fresh call may have been given after Terah's death, though it is by no means necessary to suppose it. Another imaginary difficulty arises from the statement in <a href="../../par/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a> that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he departed from Haran, that Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and that Terah died at the age of two hundred and five; and from the statement in ver. 4 of this chapter that Abram did not leave Haran till Terah's death. From which it is concluded that Terah must have lived sixty years after Abram's departure (70 + 75 + 60   =   205). But the whole difficulty arises from the gratuitous supposition that Abram was Terah's firstborn because he is named first. If Terah were a hundred and thirty at the birth of Abram, he would be two hundred and five when Abram was seventy-five. Now, there is absolutely nothing to forbid the supposition that such was his age. It does not follow that because Abram is named first he was the eldest. He might be named first as being by far the most illustrious of the three, he might be named first because the subsequent genealogies - Isaac, Jacob, and the twelve Patriarchs - were deduced from him. There may, too, have been other sons of Terah, not named here because nothing was going to be said about them. Nahor is mentioned because Rebekah was his granddaughter (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15, 24</a>) and Rachel his great-granddaughter. And Haran is mentioned because he was the father of Lot. Others, whether sons or daughters, would not be mentioned. If Terah, therefore, began to have children when he was seventy, it is quite probable that Abram may not have been born till he was a hundred and thirty. That the son named first need not necessarily be the eldest is clear from the order in which Shem, Ham, and Japheth are named, whereas it appears from <a href="../../par/genesis/9-24.htm">Genesis 9:24</a> that Ham was the youngest, and from <a href="../../par/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2, 21</a> (according to the A.V. and the LXX., Symmachus, the Targum of Onkelos, and the old Jewish commentators), that Japheth was the eldest. In <a href="../../par/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> God says, "I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau," though Esau was the elder; and so <a href="../../par/hebrews/11-20.htm">Hebrews 11:20</a>. So again in <a href="../../par/exodus/5-20.htm">Exodus 5:20</a> we read, "Moses and Aaron" (see also <a href="../../par/exodus/40-31.htm">Exodus 40:31</a>; <a href="../../par/numbers/16-43.htm">Numbers 16:43</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-5.htm">Joshua 24:5</a>; <a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-6.htm">1 Samuel 12:6</a>; etc.), though it appears from <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-3.htm">1 Chronicles 6:3</a> that Aaron was the eldest. So again we read in <a href="../../par/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>, "Thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh," and in ver. 20, "God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh," though in ver. I of the same chapter they are named according to the true order of birth - "Manasseh and Ephraim." It is, therefore, an unwarrantable inference that Abram was the eldest son because he is named first; and with the removal of this inference the difficulty vanishes; and Stephen was quite accurate when he said that God appeared to Abraham in Ur, before he dwelt in Haran, and that he did not move from Haran till the death of Terah. <span class="cmt_word">Haran</span>. <span class="accented">Charran</span> in A.V. marks the difference between <span class="accented">Haran</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>), Lot's father, and the name of the place (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). It is called "the city of Nahor" (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> compared with Genesis 47:43).

"Kindred" is a much better word here, because Joseph's "race" was already known to Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-12.htm">Genesis 41:12</a>); "was made known" is a far better phrase than "became manifest."

In <a href="../../par/genesis/46-26.htm">Genesis 46:26, 27</a>, the statement is very precise that "all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten," including Joseph and his two sons. Moreover, the accuracy of the number is tested in two ways. First, the names of the sons and daughters of each patriarch are given, and they are found, on counting them, to amount to exactly seventy. And then the totals of the descendants of each of Jacob's four wives is given separately, and again the total is exactly seventy (33 + 16 + 14 + 7   =   70). It is true that the computation in ver. 26 does not agree with the above, for it makes the number of Jacob's descendants, exclusive of Joseph and his two sons, sixty-six instead of sixty-seven, which is the number according to the two above computations, and consequently the total number (when Joseph and his two sons are added) sixty-nine instead of seventy. But this is such a manifest contradiction that it seems almost a necessity to suppose a clerical error, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, caused perhaps by the preceding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. It is also a singular anomaly that, in the enumeration of Leah's descendants, as well as in the general enumeration, Er and Onan are distinctly reckoned as well as <span class="accented">mentioned</span>. Jacob himself is nowhere reckoned in the Bible, though he is in the commentaries. But when we turn to the LXX., we find that in <a href="../../par/genesis/46-20.htm">Genesis 46:20</a> there are added to Manasseh and Ephraim Machir the son and Gilead the grandson of Manasseh; and Suthelah and Taam the sons, and Edom (meaning Eran, <span class="accented">LXX.</span> Eden, <a href="../../par/numbers/26-36.htm">Numbers 26:36</a>) the grandson, of Ephraim, making the descendants of Rachel eighteen (it should be nineteen if <span class="accented">Huppim</span>, <a href="../../par/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, is added) instead of fourteen; the number sixty-six of ver. 26 is preserved; the number of Joseph's descendants is given as nine (Huppim apparently being now reckoned), which, added to sixty-six, makes seventy-five; and accordingly in ver. 27 the LXX. read <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> ("seventy-five souls"), instead of "three score and <span class="accented">ten."</span> But except in the addition of these five names of Joseph's grand and great-grand-children, the LXX. support the Hebrew text, even in the strange <span class="accented">sixty-six</span> of ver. 26. Stephen, as a Hellenist, naturally follows the LXX. But the question arises - How are we to understand the lists? <a href="../../par/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a> says, "These are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt;" and one naturally expects to find the names only of those who are described in vers. 5-7 as the migratory party from Canaan to Egypt. This expectation is somewhat disturbed by Er and Onan being included in the enumeration. This may, however, be accounted for by Pharez and Zerah being reckoned as their seed. But is it likely that Hezron and Hamul the sons of Pharez, and the other great-grandsons of Jacob, were born before the descent into Egypt? The answer to this is that, as Jacob was a hundred and thirty years old when he came down to Egypt (<a href="../../par/genesis/47-28.htm">Genesis 47:28</a>), there is no improbability in his having great-grandchildren (allowing forty years for a generation); on the contrary, every likelihood that he should. But on the other hand, as Joseph could not have been above fifty when Jacob came down to Egypt (30 + 14 + X.), <a href="../../par/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46, 29, 30</a>, it does not seem likely or possible that Joseph should have had grown-up grandsons and a great-grandson, as the LXX. make him have. Indeed, to all appearance Manasseh and Ephraim were unmarried young men at the time that Jacob blessed them (<a href="../../par/genesis/48-11.htm">Genesis 48:11, 16</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-23.htm">Genesis 50:23</a>). Therefore we may conclude certainly that the additional numbers of the LXX. are incorrect, if understood literally, of these who came down with Jacob from Canaan to Egypt. But there is nothing improbable in Benjamin having ten children. Judah, to whom grandchildren are attributed, was Jacob's fourth son, and might be forty or fifty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Asher, to whom also grandsons are attributed, was the eighth son, and might be twenty years older than Joseph and Benjamin. Still, considering that Er and Onan are reckoned among those who came down to Egypt, it would not be surprising to find that some of those mentioned in the list were born after Jacob's arrival, but included on some principle which we do not understand. In other words, a literal interpretation of the statement of the Hebrew Bible involves no impossibilities, but a literal interpretation of the statement of the LXX. does.

As regards the statement in the text, two distinct transactions seem at first sight to be mixed up. One, that Abraham bought the field of Machpelah of Ephron the Hittite for a burial-place, where he and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, were buried (<a href="../../par/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16, 17, 19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>); the other, that Jacob "bought a parcel of a field..., at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money," where the bones of Joseph were buried by Joshua (<a href="../../par/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>; <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>), and where, according to a tradition still surviving in the days of St. Jerome, the other patriarchs were also buried ('Epistol.'86," She came to Sichem, now called Neapolis (or Nablous), and from thence visited the tombs of the twelve patriarchs"). See also Jerome, 'De Optimo Genere Interpretandi. All Jewish writers, however, are wholly silent" about this tradition, perhaps from jealousy of the Samaritans (Lightfoot, vol. 8. p. 423). And Josephus affirms that all but Joseph were buried at Hebron ('Ant. Jud.,'2. 8:2); and that their beautiful marble monuments were to be seen at Hebron in his day. In the cave of Machpelah, however, there is no tomb of any of the twelve patriarchs except Joseph; and his so-called tomb is of a different character and situation from the genuine ones (Stanley's 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' 1st series, pp. 498-500. See also 'Sermons in the East': 'The Mosque of Hebron'). But on looking closer at the text it appears pretty certain that only Shechem was in Stephen's mind. For first he speaks of Shechem at once, <span class="cmt_word">And were carried over unto Shechem</span>. And adds and <span class="cmt_word">were laid in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> Except the one word "Abraham," the whole sentence points to Shechem. What he says of Shechem is exactly in accordance with <a href="../../par/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18, 19</a>. And what he says of their fathers being carried over and buried at Shechem is exactly true of Joseph's bones, as related in <a href="../../par/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>. So that the one difficulty is the word "Abraham." It seems much more probable that this word should have been interpolated by some early transcriber, who saw no nominative case to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and who had in his mind a confused recollection of Abraham's purchase, than that Stephen, who shows such thorough knowledge of the Bible history, should have made a gross mistake in such a well-known and famous circumstance as the purchase of the field of Machpelah, or that Luke should have perpetuated it had he made it in the hurry of speech. It cannot be affirmed with certainty that Stephen confirms the story of the other patriarchs being buried at Shechem, though possibly he alludes to the tradition. The plural, "they were carried," etc., might be put generally, though only Joseph was meant (as <a href="../../par/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a>; <a href="../../par/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> compared with <a href="../../par/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39</a>; <a href="../../par/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>), or "the bones of Joseph" might possibly be the subject, though not expressed. Lightfoot - followed by Bishop Wordsworth, who thinks that Abraham really did buy a field of Ephron in Sychem, when he was there (<a href="../../par/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>)-would thus be right in supposing that the point of Stephen's remark was that the patriarchs were buried in Shechem.

The angel who spake to Moses in the bush in the Name of God was God's instrument in sending Moses. When an angel gives a message from God, the words are always given as spoken by God himself (see <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1-3</a>). In this verse Stephen, having with great oratorical skill entranced their attention by his recital of God's marvelous revelation of himself to Moses, now takes them off their guard, and shews how their fathers treated Moses just as they had treated Jesus Christ; and how God in the case of Moses had chosen and magnified the very man whom they had scornfully rejected; just as now he had exalted Jesus Christ to be a Prince and a Savior, whom they had crucified.

In Stephen's time it could hardly have become widely known as the designation of the flock of Christ. On the whole, the marginal rendering, "the congregation," seems best, but with the idea attached that it was the Lord's congregation. <span class="cmt_word">The angel which spake</span>. It may be doubted whether the phrase, "the angel which spake to him in the mount Sinai," refers to the angel spoken of in ver. 30, or to the angel by whose mouth God spake the words of the ten commandments on Mount Sinai, as recorded in <a href="../../par/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1-22</a>. Chrysostom and most commentators seem to understand it of the angel who gave the Law; but Whitby, not without reason, thinks the reference is to the burning bush. <span class="cmt_word">Living oracles</span>. In like manner, St. Paul calls the Holy Scriptures "the oracles of God" (<a href="../../par/romans/3-2.htm">Romans 3:2</a>), and in <a href="../../par/hebrews/5-12.htm">Hebrews 5:12</a> we read again of "the first principles of the oracles of God," and St. Peter says, "Let him speak as the oracles of God" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/4-11.htm">1 Peter 4:11</a>).

This, according to Lightfoot, with whom most commentators agree, was in accordance with a very common practice of readers in the schools and pulpits of the Jews, to adapt and accommodate a text to their own immediate purpose, keeping, however, to historical truth. Here Stephen points to the Babylonish Captivity as the punishment of the sins of their fathers, thus warning them of more terrible judgments to follow their rejection of Christ. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a></div><div class="verse">Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for yea, A.V.; the <span class="accented">god Rephan</span> for <span class="accented">your god Remphan</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">the figures</span> for <span class="accented">figures</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The god Rephan</span>. Rephan, or Raiphan, or Remphan, as it is variously written, is the LXX. translation of the Hebrew <span class="accented">Chiun</span> in <a href="../../par/amos/5-26.htm">Amos 5:26</a>. The best explanation of this is that Rephan is the Coptic name of the planet Saturn, well-known of course to the LXX., and that Chiun is the Hebrew and Arabic name of the same star, which they therefore translated by Rephan. With regard to the difficulty which has been felt by many <span class="accented">that</span> there is no mention of any such worship of Moloch and Chiun in the wilderness, and that sacrifices were continually offered to the Lord, it seems to arise from an entire misconception of the passage in Amos. What Amos means to say is that because of the treacherous, unfaithful heart of Israel, as shown in the worship of the golden calf and all their rebellions in the wilderness, all their sacrifices were worthless. Just as he had said in <a href="../../par/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>, "Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts;" "I hate, I despise your feast days; Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols" (<a href="../../par/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21, 23</a>): just as Isaiah also says, "To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?... I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts ... Bring no more vain oblations; ... it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-13</a>, etc.); and again, "He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/66-3.htm">Isaiah 66:3</a>): so all the sacrifices offered up during forty years in the wilderness were no sacrifices at all, and their hypocrisy was clearly seen when they reached the land of Canaan, and, according to Moses' prophetic declaration, "forsook God which made them...  aria sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15-18</a>), such as Chiun and Moloch, Baalim and Ashtoreth. This later idolatry was the fruit and the judicial punishment of their first declension and apostasy in the wilderness, and led to the Captivity in Babylon. It was on seeing their unfaithfulness in the wilderness that" God turned and gave them up to serve the host of heaven."

In applying this expression to his hearers, Stephen was using the identical language of Moses when he conveyed God's rebuke to them.

For they were without the true circumcision, that of the heart. Here again Stephen was teaching in the exact spirit and even words of Moses and the prophets. See <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> (where Stephen's two reproaches occur together); <a href="../../par/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>; and many other passages.

So here they received the Law "at" or "on the occasion of," the "ordering" or "appointing" of angels. When the angels, who were commissioned by God and spoke in his Name, gave the Law, the Israelites so received it. The A.V., "by the disposition of angels" very nearly ex- presses the true sense. Another sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> - "in view of" - comes to nearly the same thing. St. Paul speaks of the part taken by the angels in the giving of the Law, and in language strikingly resembling the text. He says of it, that it was "ordained through ['by,' A V] angels" God ordained or appointed the Law, but the angels were the instruments or ministers of its promulgation. And it is also distinctly referred to in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, where the LXX. read, "On his right hand the angels were with him." In the foregoing verses the application which Stephen had all through been contemplating is hurled with accumulated force at the consciences of his hearers, and cuts them to the heart, but does not bring them to repentance.

This appearance of Saul upon the stage of St. Luke's narrative is an element which will soon change the whole current of the narrative, and divert it from Jerusalem to the whole earth. Nothing can be more striking than this introduction of the young man Saul to our view as an accomplice (albeit "ignorantly in unbelief") in the martyrdom of Stephen. Who that stood there and saw him keeping the clothes of the witnesses would have imagined that he would become the foremost apostle of the faith which he sought to destroy from off the face of the earth?

It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The apostles</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">They sent unto them Peter and John</span>. The selection of these two chief apostles shows the great importance attached to the conversion of the Samaritans.

There is no mention of such prayer or such imposition of hands in the case of the first three thousand who were baptized. They were told by St. Peter, "Be baptized every one of you, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>), and they were baptized, and doubtless did receive the Holy Ghost, Neither is there any mention of such things in the case of the subsequent thousands who were baptized at Jerusalem on the apostles' preaching. Why, then, was it so in Samaria? To answer this question, we must observe the difference in the circumstances. The baptisms at Jerusalem were performed by the apostles themselves. The Holy Ghost was given upon their promise and assurance. But in Samaria the preaching and the baptizing were done by the scattered disciples. There was a danger of many independent bodies springing up, owing no allegiance to the apostles, and cemented by no bonds to the mother Church. But Christ's Church was to be one - many members, but one body. The apostolate was to be the governing power of the whole Church, by the will and ordinance of Christ. Hence there was a manifest reason why, when the gospel spread beyond Judaea, these visible spiritual gifts should be given only through the laying on of the apostles' hands, and by the intervention of their prayers. This had a manifest and striking influence in marking and preserving the unity of the Church, and in marking and maintaining the sovereignty of the apostolic rule. For precisely the same reason has the Catholic and Apostolic Church in all ages (<a href="../../par/acts/19-5.htm">Acts 19:5, 6</a>; <a href="../../par/hebrews/6-2.htm">Hebrews 6:2</a>) maintained the rite of confirmation, "after the example of the holy apostles." Besides the other great benefits connected with it, its influence in binding up in the unity of the Church the numerous parishes of the diocese, instead of letting them become independent congregations, is very great. Observe, too, how prayer and the laying on of hands are tied together. Neither is valid without the other. In this case, as at Pentecost, the extraordinary gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred. In confirmation, now that miracles have ceased, it is the ordinary and invisible grace of the Holy Spirit that is to be looked for.

This, as St. Peter saw, was exactly the case with Simon, whose heart was not straight with God, but "had turned away from him," as it is said in Deuteronomy. Though baptized, he was still an idolater in heart, and likely to trouble many. "The gall of bitterness" is the same as "gall and wormwood," or "bitterness." "Gall," or "bile," is in classical Greek and other languages a synonym for "bitterness," especially in a figurative sense (see <a href="../../par/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15, 19</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX.). The uncommon phrase, the bond of iniquity, seems to be borrowed from <a href="../../par/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where the LXX. have the same words, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "loose the bands of wickedness," A.V.

That district, he is reminded, was desert, part, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, or the desert of Judaea. The spot was probably selected for that very reason, as affording the privacy necessary for the eunuch to read in his chariot, and for Philip to join him and expound the Word of God to him.

Schleusner takes the genitives in "threatening and slaughter" as genitives of the thing desired, "punting after threatening and slaughter" (comp. <a href="../../par/amos/2-7.htm">Amos 2:7</a>). Meyer explains it "out of the threatenings and murder [in his heart] breathing hard at the disciples" - an expression indicating passion. Alford, taking nearly the sense of the A.V., makes "threatenings and slaughter" to be as it were the very material of his breath, whether breathed out or breathed in. Considering that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> means "to breathe in," as distinguished from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, "to breathe out," and that these two are opposed to each other in Hippocrates (see Schleusner), the A.V. <span class="accented">breathing out</span> cannot be justified; nor is it likely that "Luke the physician" would forget the distinction. The difficulty is to explain the genitive case of "threatenings" and "slaughter." <span class="cmt_word">The high priest</span>; probably the same person who is so described in <a href="../../par/acts/7-1.htm">Acts 7:1</a> (where see note). If the year with which we are now dealing was the year A.D. , Caiaphas was high priest. But Alford, Lewin, Farrar, and others place Saul's conversion in A.D. , when Theophilus, son of Annas or Ananus, was high priest (Chronicles Table in Alford's 'Proleg. to Acts').

But it is clear from vers. 10 and 13 that there was already a considerable number of Christian Jews at Damascus. And this, with the fact of there being a great multitude of Jews settled there, was a sufficient reason why Saul should ask for letters to each of the synagogues at Damascus, directing them to send any Christians who might be found amongst them bound to Jerusalem to be tried there before the Sanhedrim. There may have been thirty or forty synagogues at Damascus, and not less than forty thousand resident Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Way</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> holding the doctrine of Christ. Thus in <a href="../../par/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25, 26</a>, the Christian faith is spoken of as "the way of the Lord" and "the way of God." In <a href="../../par/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>, was the term by which the faith of Christ was spoken of chiefly, perhaps, among the Jews. The term means a peculiar doctrine or sect. Its application to Christians apparently lasted only so long as Christianity was considered to be a modification or peculiar form of Judaism, and its frequent use in the Acts is therefore an evidence of the early composition of the book.

Some, as Lord Lytlelton and Lewin ('Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. p. 48), from the expressions, "fell to the ground," "fell to the earth," infer that Saul was "himself mounted, and his followers some mounted and some on foot." And Farrar also, far other reasons, supposes that Saul and his companions rode horses or mules. The journey, he says, was nearly a hundred and fifty miles, and the roads rough, bad, and steep; and Saul was traveling as the <span class="accented">legate or</span> the high priest. Still it is strange that no one expression should point distinctly to the party being on horseback, which "falling to the earth," or "ground," certainly do not. While, on the other hand, the phrases, "Arise," "stood speechless," "led him by the hand," seem rather to point to his being on foot.

They have, in fact, no manuscript authority (Meyer; Alford); and not much patristic authority, or from versions, and are omitted by all modern editors.

(e.g. <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-10.htm">Isaiah 56:10</a>) and in classical Greek. Here it means speechless from terror, struck dumb. The description here given by St. Luke seems to be contradictory in two particulars to St. Paul's own account in <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> and Acts 26:14. For St. Paul's companions are said here to have "stood speechless;" but in <a href="../../par/acts/26-14.htm">Acts 26:14</a> they were "all fallen to the earth." Here they "hear the voice," but in <a href="../../par/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a> they "heard not the voice of him that spake." It is obvious, however, that in such descriptions all depends upon the particular moment of the transaction described which happens to be uppermost in the mind of the speaker or writer at the time, and the particular purpose in relation to which he is giving the description. Thus at one moment the spectators might be standing dumfounded, and at the next they might be prostrate on the ground, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> Either description of their attitude would be a true one, though not true with regard to the same moment. Again, if the purpose of the speaker was to affirm that the whole company were conscious of both the vision and the sound of a voice speaking, but that only Saul saw the Divine Speaker, the description "hearing the voice, but beholding no man" would be the natural one. Whereas, if the purpose was to express that Saul alone heard the words spoken to him by the Lord, the description of his companions," They saw indeed the light...  but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me," would be equally natural. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-8.htm">Acts 9:8</a></div><div class="verse">And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought <i>him</i> into Damascus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">Nothing</span> for <span class="accented">no man</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and</span> for <span class="accented">but</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). So the best manuscripts and editions The idea is, not like that in <a href="../../par/matthew/17-8.htm">Matthew 17:8</a> that when he opened his eyes the person seen in vision had disappeared, but simply that his eyesight was gone, "for the glory of that light," and he could see nothing, but had to be led like a blind man (see <a href="../../par/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>).

The same reason, we may venture to think, which caused the interposition of three days' blindness between Saul's conversion and his baptism, led Saul himself to pass those days in a voluntary self-abasement. His sin in persecuting the Church of God and its Divine Head, his guilt in assisting at the death of God's saints, and in rejecting the testimony to Christ's resurrection, had been very great. These three days of blindness and of fasting were therefore a fitting preparation for the grace of forgiveness about to be so freely and fully given to him (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12-16</a>). What thoughts must have passed through Saul's mind during those three days! Before passing on, it may be well to observe that it is to this appearance to him of Jesus Christ that St. Paul undoubtedly refers when he says (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/9-1.htm">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>), "Have not I seen Jesus Christ?" and again (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-8.htm">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>), "Last of all, he was seen of me also," where he puts this appearance of Jesus to himself on a par with those to Peter and James and the other apostles, which made them competent witnesses of the resurrection of Christ. And so in ver. 17 of this chapter Ananias says, "The Lord Jesus which was seen by thee" (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); and Barnabas (ver. 27), when he brought Saul to the apostles, related "how he had seen the Lord in the way." And in <a href="../../par/acts/22-14.htm">Acts 22:14</a> Ananias says, "God hath appointed thee to see the Righteous One." Moreover the description in ver. 7 of Saul's fellow-travelers, that they "saw no man," implies, by contrast, that Saul did. The reticence of both St. Paul and St. Luke as to what he saw, and what was the appearance of the Lord Jesus, seems to arise from profound reverence and awe, such as St. Paul speaks of in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-4.htm">2 Corinthians 12:4</a>. It may be also worth remarking how this appearance of Christ was deferred till he was quite close to Damascus, according to one tradition only a quarter of a mile from the gates, but according to Porter, whom Farrar and Lewin follow, at a distance of about ten miles, at a village called Caueab. So the intervention of the angel by which Isaac's life was spared was not till Abraham had the knife in his hand to slay his son; and Peter's prison doors were opened not till the very night before he was to have been brought forth to death. Faith and patience are thus strengthened, and God's intervention is more marked. There is not the slightest trace in the narrative of what the fancy of many has suggested, that Saul's uneasy conscience was wrought up into a paroxysm as he approached Damascus, and so prepared the way for the vision of Christ. Even Canon Farrar's eloquent description of what he supposes to have been the thoughts which agitated Saul's mind on his eventful journey seems hardly to rest on any solid base (see 'Life of St. Paul,'vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a>.).

It still exists, and is called the Sultany Street; but instead of being the wide and splendid street it was in the apostolic age, a hundred feet wide, with colonnades separating the two footways on the side from the central read, and adorned with a triumphal arch, it is contracted into a narrow mean passage (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 69).

Ananias's answer shows his profound astonishment, mixed with doubt and misgiving, at the commission given to him.

Some commentators would interpose the journey to Arabia (mentioned <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>) between vers. 19 and 20; and this seems to be the intention of the A.V., where the clause commencing with <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (ver. 19) seems to wind up and close the preceding narrative. This too is the view strongly supported by Canon Farrar, vol. 1. <a href="../../par/acts/11.htm">Acts 11</a>, and by Lewin. Alford places the journey to Arabia in the time comprised in ver. 22; others before ver. 22; Neander, Meyer, and others, in the time comprised in the "many days" of ver. 23. And this last is undoubtedly the easiest, were it not for the considerations urged by Farrar with great force as to the probability of St. Paul seeking a period of retirement after his conversion before commencing any public preaching, and the further countenance given to this view by <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, where St. Paul certainly says of himself that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">immediately</span>, after his conversion he "went away to Arabia." Taking all things into consideration, and supposing that either Luke was not aware of the sojourn in Arabia, or that he omitted from his notes some brief notice of it immediately preceding the description of Saul's preaching in Damascus, which explained the following <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, it seems best to understand the latter part of ver. 19 and all that follows as subsequent to his return from Arabia; and to conclude that he only stayed at Damascus <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, a few days, after his conversion, and then retired to Arabia. It may be observed, too, that this interpretation gives a significance to the mention of the "certain days" which otherwise it has not. There is a further difference of opinion as to what is meant by <span class="accented">Arabia.</span> The most common view is that <span class="accented">Auranitis</span>, bordering upon Arabia Deserts, and reckoned as part of Arabia, not above two days' journey from Damascus, is the country meant. But others understand it in its more strictly Hebrew sense of the Peninsula of Sinai (Farrar, vol. 1. p. 212, and Exeursus 9; Dean Howson on Galatians in 'Speaker's Commentary;' Bishop Lightfoot on <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>). This view is decidedly strengthened by the fact that, in the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians, St. Paul clearly means by <span class="accented">Arabia</span> the Peninsula of Arabia, where Sinai was (<a href="../../par/galatians/4-25.htm">Galatians 4:25</a>). On the assumption that the Sinaitic Peninsula is meant, Bishop Lightfoot says, "He was attracted thither by a spirit akin to that which formerly had driven Elijah to the same region. Standing on the threshold of the new covenant, he was anxious to look upon the birthplace of the old; that, dwelling for a while in seclusion in the presence of the mount that burned with fire, he might ponder over the transient glories of the ministration of death, and apprehend its real purpose in relation to the more glorious covenant which was now to supplant it." His journey to Arabia need not necessarily have occupied more than two or three mouths. It seems certain that he did not preach there, because he says (<a href="../../par/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>), "I declared to them at Damascus <span class="accented">first</span>," etc. (see another coincidence between the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians in <a href="../../par/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>, note). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-20.htm">Acts 9:20</a></div><div class="verse">And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="accented">In the synagogues he proclaimed</span> Jesus for he <span class="accented">preached Christ in the synagogues</span>, A.V. and T.R. The preponderance of manuscript authority, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> of ver. 21, and the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 22, seem conclusive in favor of <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> rather than <span class="accented">Christ</span>. As regards the expression <span class="cmt_word">straightway</span>, we must understand it as descriptive of Saul's action upon his return from Arabia. Is it possible that St. Luke uses it with the same meaning as he may have heard St. Paul use it in when speaking of his Damascus preaching, in the same sense as St. Paul actually does speak in <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17</a>, viz. as expressing that he did not wait for authority from the apostles, but at once, fresh from the Divine call, and having a direct commission from Christ himself, entered upon his apostolic ministry? If the Epistle to the Galatians was written A.D. , it would be just about the time that St. Luke joined St. Paul, and might be commencing to collect materials for his history. So that the phrase in the Galatians and the phrase in this twentieth verse might really be the expression of one thought committed to paper by St. Paul on the one hand, and uttered in the ear of Luke on the other. It is a confirmation of this view that in 2 Corinthians, written about the same time, there is also an account of Saul's escape from Damascus<span class="cmt_word">. In the synagogues</span>; the very synagogues (ver. 2) to which the letters of the high priest were addressed, empowering him to arrest either man or woman who called upon the Name of Jesus, and bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem to be tried before the Sanhedrim. No wonder they were amazed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/acts/9-21.htm">Acts 9:21</a></div><div class="verse">But all that heard <i>him</i> were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - And for but, A.V.; <span class="accented">that in Jerusalem made havoc of</span> for <span class="accented">that destroyed them</span> (which called on this Name) <span class="accented">in Jerusalem</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and he had come hither for this intent</span> for <span class="accented">and came hither for that intent</span>, A.V., differently stopped; <span class="accented">before</span> for <span class="accented">unto</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The chief priests</span>.

As already observed, it presupposes the mention of Jesus, of whom it is thus predicated that he is both "the Son of God" and "the Christ" (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32, 36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/4-11.htm">Acts 4:11</a>, etc.). Observe the incidental proof of the general expectation of the Jews that Christ should come in this description of the apostolic preaching as directed to the one point that Jesus of Nazareth was the Christ.

The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in <a href="../../par/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>), he uses the same word for "let down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), tells us he was let down "by the wall," R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and that it was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, Alford adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and holds <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, caused by the situation of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The R.T. cannot be right. "The disciples" is St. Luke's regular expression for "Christians" (<a href="../../par/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1, 2, 7</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10, 19, 26</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>), and is our Lord's name for his followers, but is never used by an apostle of his own followers (see <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4-7</a>).

The narrative thus far exactly agrees with <a href="../../par/galatians/1-17.htm">Galatians 1:17, 18</a>, which, however, supplies the motive of the journey to Jerusalem, which is not here mentioned, viz. to see Peter. It seems strange to some commentators that the news of Saul having become a zealous Christian should not have reached Jerusalem after an interval of three years. But first, we do not know. how much of those three years was spent in Arabia, nor how much the unsettled state of Damascus may have interrupted the usual communication between Jerusalem and Damascus, nor how suspicious of evil the poor persecuted disciples at Jerusalem may have been. They knew of the fierceness of Saul's zeal as a persecutor by their own experience; they knew of him as a disciple only by report. It may have been only an instance of the truth of Horace's maxim, "Segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sunt occults subjecta fidelibus."

The other apostles were probably absent from Jerusalem during that fortnight; but Barnabas did, it seems, at a Church assembly, in the presence of James and, no doubt, the elders of the Church, give the astonishing narrative of Saul's conversion. This removed their suspicious and their fears, and he was freely, during the rest of his brief stay, admitted as a brother to their assemblies, and took part in preaching the gospel in the synagogues.

If further proof were wanting, it could be found in the phrase, "brought him down," as compared with the converse, "gone up" (<a href="../../par/acts/18-22.htm">Acts 18:22</a>), "ascended "(<a href="../../par/acts/25-1.htm">Acts 25:1</a>), when the journey was from Caesarea to Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">To Tarsus</span>. A glance at the map will show that, starting from Caesarea, a person might either go by land along the sea-coast of Phoenicia, through Acre, Tyre, Sidon, Beyrout, Tripolis, Antioch, Issus, to Tarsus; or by sea to any of the intermediate ports between Caesarea and Tarsus; or rather the artificial harbor at the mouth of the Cydnus which formed the seaport of Tarsus. It is not improbable that Paul landed at Selcucia, since he says (<a href="../../par/galatians/1-21.htm">Galatians 1:21</a>) that he came at this time "into the regions of Syria and Cilicia," which is exactly what he would have done if he had landed at Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch.

It is thought that the attention of the Jews to the progress of the faith of Jesus Christ was diverted at this time, and their active hostility stayed, by the still greater danger to the Jews' religion which arose from Caligula's intention of placing a statue to himself as a god in the holy of holies. Thus did God's gracious providence intervene to give rest to his harassed saints, and to build up his Church in numbers, in holiness, and in heavenly comfort. Especially Paul had another breathing-time, which may have been the more required if, as is thought, one at least of the five scourgings mentioned in <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>:24 had been inflicted at Damascus, and one of the three shipwrecks alluded to in the same passage and been undergone in the dangerous coasting voyage from Caesarca to Scleucia.

Afford, following Meyer, understands "through all the saints," which is scarcely so well. The current of St. Luke's narrative is here temporarily diverted from St. Paul, in order to trace that portion of St. Peter's apostolic work, which led immediately to that opening of the door of faith to the Gentiles in which Peter was to have the priority in point of time (<a href="../../par/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18, 19</a>), but Paul the chief burden of labour and danger (<a href="../../par/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7-9</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>), and which was also the main subject of St. Luke's history. <span class="cmt_word">He came down</span>; Lydda (afterwards called Diospolis, now Ludd), being more than half-way between Jerusalem and the sea-coast at Joppa.
