<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nineveh</span>, the capital of the kingdom of Assyria, is first mentioned in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>, as founded by Nimrod. It stood on the left bank of the river Tigris, where it is joined by the Khosr, opposite to the present town of Mosul. The Assyrians had already become known in Syria. In  <span class="date">B.C. 854</span> Shal-maneser II. had defeated at Karkar twelve kings confederate against him, among whom is reckoned Ahab King of Israel. Long before his time, Tiglath-Pileser I. had made a great expedition to the west, captured a town at the foot of Lebanon, and reached the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Jehu was compelled to pay tribute to the Assyrians; and Rimmon-nirari, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 810</span> to 781, held the suzerainty of Phoenicia, Samaria, Edom, and Philistia. Jonah, therefore, knew well what his country might expect at the hands of this people. <span class="cmt_word">That great city.</span> It is thus called in <a href="../../par/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; and the epithet is added here in order to show to Jonah the importance of his mission. The size of Nineveh is variously estimated according to the sense attached to the name "Nineveh." This appellation may be restricted to Nineveh proper, or it may comprise the four cities which lay close together in the immediate neighbourhood of each other, and whose remains are now known as the mounds of <span class="accented">Kouyunjik</span>, on the southwest, directly opposite to Mosul; <span class="accented">Nimrud</span>, about eighteen miles to the southeast; <span class="accented">Karamless</span>, twelve miles to the north; and <span class="accented">Khorsabad</span>, the most northerly, about the same distance both from Karamless and Kouyunjik. Khorsabad, however, was not built till some hundred years after Jonah's time (Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 448). These cities are contained in an irregular parallelogram of some sixty miles in circumference. The following account of Nineveh proper is derived from Professor Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:252, etc.: "The ruins consist of two principal mounds, Nebbiyunus and Kouyunjik. The Kouyunjik mound, which lies nearly half a mile northwest of the others, is very much the more considerable of the two. Its shape is an irregular oval, elongated to a point towards the northeast. The surface is nearly flat; the sides slope at a steep angle, and are furrowed with numerous ravines worn in the soft material by the rains of some thirty centuries. The greatest height above the plain is ninety feet, and the area is estimated at a hundred acres. It is an artificial eminence, computed to contain 14,500,000 tons of earth, and on it were erected the palaces and temples of the Assyrian monarchs. The mound of Nebbi-yunus is at its base nearly triangular, and covers an area of nearly forty acres. It is loftier, and its sides are more precipitous than Kouyunjik, especially on the west, where it abutted on the wall of the city. The mass of earth is calculated at six and a half millions of tons. These two vast mounds are both in the same line, and  abutted on the western wall of the city, which was some two and a half miles in length. Anciently it seems to have immediately overhung the Tigris, but the river has now receded to the west, leaving a plain of nearly a mile in width between its bank and the old rampart which evidently once followed the course of the river bank. The western wall is joined at fight angles by the northern rampart which runs in a straight line for seven thousand feet. At its other extremity the western wall forms a very obtuse angle with the southern, which impends over a deep ravine, and runs in a straight line for about a thousand yards, when it meets the eastern wall, which is the longest and the least regular of the four. The entire length of this side is sixteen thousand feet, or above three miles. It is divided into two portions by. the Stream of the Khosr-su; which, coming from the northwest, finds its way through the city and then across the low plain to the Tigris. The town is thus of an oblong shape, and the circuit of its walls is somewhat less than eight miles, and the area which they include is eighteen hundred acres. This, at the computation of something less than one hundred inhabitants per acre, would ascribe to Nineveh a population of one hundred and seventy-five thousand souls" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 1. ch. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Cry against it.</span> The message is given in <a href="../../par/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>. Thus the knowledge of the true God is made known among the Gentiles. <span class="cmt_word">Their wickedness;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, as Pusey notes, their evil doing towards others, as in <a href="../../par/nahum/3-19.htm">Nahum 3:19</a> (see Introduction, &sect; I.). <span class="cmt_word">Is come up before me,</span> and appeals for punishment, as <a href="../../par/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/18-20.htm">Genesis 18:20, 21</a>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>, "The cry of its wickedness is come up unto me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; probably, <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>, a Phoenician city on the south coast of Spain, and therefore in the opposite direction to Nineveh. He was sent to the far east; he flees to the distant west. <span class="cmt_word">From the presence of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from the face of Jehovah.</span> This may mean, from God s special presence in Jerusalem or the Holy Land, as banishment from Cannaan is called "casting out of his sight" (<a href="../../par/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20, 23</a>; <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>); or, from serving the Lord as his minister (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), Jonah preferring to renounce his office as prophet rather than execute his mission. The former seems the most natural explanation of the phrase. Kimchi says that Jonah supposed that the spirit of prophecy would not extend beyond the land of Israel. He could never have thought to escape from God's all-seeing eye. His repugnance to the duty imposed upon him arose partly from national prejudice, which made him loth to interfere in Gentile business, and partly, as he himself says (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), because he feared God's compassion would spare the Ninevites on their repentance, and that thus his prediction would be discredited, and mercy shown to heathens already inimical to Israel, if not known to him as the future conquerors of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Joppa.</span> This is the modern <span class="accented">Jaffa</span> (called Japho in <a href="../../par/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>), a town on the seacoast thirty miles in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem. "Jaffa," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 8, etc.), "is one of the oldest cities in the world. It was given to Dan in the distribution of the land by Joshua, and it has been known to history ever since. It owes its existence to the low ledge of rocks which extends into the sea from the extremity of the little cape on which the city stands, and forms a small harbour. Insignificant as it is, and insecure, yet, there being no other on all this coast, it was sufficient to cause a city to spring up around it even in the earliest times, and to sustain its life through numberless changes of dynasties, races, and religions, down to the present hour. It was, in fact, the only harbour of any notoriety possessed by the Jews throughout the greater part of their national existence. To it the timber for both the temples of Jerusalem was brought from Lebanon; and no doubt a lucrative trade in cedar and pine was always carried on through it with the nations who had possession of that goodly mountain. Through it, also, nearly all the foreign commerce of the Jews was conducted, until the artificial pert of Caessarea was built by Herod .... The harbour, howewer, is very inconvenient and insecure. Vessels of any considerable burden must lie out in the open road-stead - a very uneasy berth at all times; and even a moderate wind will oblige them to slip their cables and run out to sea, or seek anchorage at Haifa, sixty miles distant .... The road-stead is liable to sudden and unexpected storms, which stir up a tumultuous sea in a very short time .... The landing also is most inconvenient, and often extremely dangerous. More boats upset, and more lives are lost in the breakers at the north end of the ledge of rocks that defend the inner harbour than anywhere else on this coast." <span class="cmt_word">Went down into it</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "went up into it" (Septuagint).

Jonah had told them (ver. 10) that he was flying from God's service, but, knowing and earing nothing about Jehovah, they took him on board when he paid his fare, and thought nothing of his private reasons for joining them

Pusey quotes Josephus's account of the harbour of Joppa and the neighbouring sea, which, he says, is rendered very dangerous by the sudden rise of "the black north wind" ('Bell. Jud.,' 3:09. 3). Here we see wind and storm fulfilling God's word (<a href="../../par/psalms/148-8.htm">Psalm 148:8</a>).

Jonah hid himself there before the storm arose. The Hebrew word for "ship" (<span class="accented">sephinah</span>) is found nowhere else, and, probably from its derivation (<span class="accented">saphan</span>, "to cover"), implies that the vessel was decked. <span class="cmt_word">He lay, and was fast asleep;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>, "was asleep and snoring," (Septuagint); <span class="accented">dormiebat sopore gravi</span> (Vulgate).

He was fatigued and worn out with mental anxiety, and now being, as he thought, secure, and longing for solitude, he lay down to sleep, unconscious of danger. Contrast this sleep in the storm with that of Christ (<a href="../../par/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), and that of the apostles who slept for sorrow (<a href="../../par/luke/22-45.htm">Luke 22:45</a>).

Jonah doubtless had meantime complied with the captain's request, but, as the sailors saw, without visible effect. The belief that temporal calamities are often connected with the presence of culprits, and are sent in judgment, is found in classical authors. Thus Plautus, 'Rudena,' 2:21 -  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Pol minume miror, navis si fracta est tibi,<br />Scelus te et sceleste parta quae vexit bona."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Little I wonder if the ship is wrecked<br />Which carries thee and thy ill-gotten wealth."</span> (Comp.

The fish was not created then and there, but God so ordered it that it should be at the place and should swallow Jonah. The prophet seems, from some expressions in his psalm (<a href="../../par/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a>), to have sunk to the bottom of the sea before he was swallowed by the fish. <span class="cmt_word">A great fish;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="../../par/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). There is nothing in the word to identify the intended animal, and to call it "a whale" is simply a mistranslation. The white shark of the Mediterranean (<span class="accented">Carcharias, vulgaris</span>), which sometimes measures twenty-five feet in length, has been known to swallow a man whole, and even a horse. This may have been the "great fish" in the text (see Dr. Pusey on Jonah, pp. 257, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the belly of the fish.</span> God used the natural agency of the fish, but the preservation of Jonah's life in the animal's belly is plainly supernatural. It is, indeed, analogous to the life of the child in its mother's womb; but it has besides a miraculous element which is unique, unless it was an actual death and revivification, as in the case of Lazarus. Also God ordained this  transaction as a type of the resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Three days and three nights;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew usage, parts of the days and nights; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one whole day, and parts of the day before and after this.

The historical nature of this occurrence is substantiated by Christ's reference to it as a figure of his own burial and resurrection. The antitype confirms the truth of the type. It is not credible that Christ would use a mere legendary tale, with no historical basis, to confirm his most solemn statement concerning the momentous fact of his resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../obadiah/1.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Obadiah 1"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Obadiah 1" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jonah/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jonah 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jonah 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/jonah/2.htm"><title>Jonah 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/jonah/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/jonah/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/jonah/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../jonah/1.htm" title="Jonah 1">&#9668;</a> Jonah 2 <a href="../jonah/3.htm" title="Jonah 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-10.</span> - Part I.

The grammatical arrangement, and especially the language of ver. 7, seem to speak of a deliverance already experienced rather than of one expected. As this "prayer" does not suit an allegory, and as no cue but Jonah could have known its substance, we have here an argument for his authorship. It is rather a thanksgiving than a prayer - like that of Hennas (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-1.htm">1 Samuel 2:1</a>). When he realizes that he was saved from drowning, he uttered his gratitude, and saw that he might hope for further rescue. How he passed the three days we cannot tell; some have thought he was unconscious; but thin is, perhaps, hardly consistent with the notice of his praying, and with the action of his great Antitype, who, during his sojourn in the unseen world, "preached to the spirits in prison" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His God.</span> He acknowledges Jehovah as his God.

St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 18:44) endeavours to explain the discrepaney mystically as referring to Christ under different circumstances, as being the same who remained forty days on earth after his resurrection, and who rose again on the third day. <span class="cmt_word">Shall be overthrown.</span> This is the word used for the destruction of Sodom (<a href="../../par/genesis/19-25.htm">Genesis 19:25, 27</a>; <a href="../../par/amos/4-11.htm">Amos 4:11</a>). The prophet appears to have gone on through the city, repeating this one awful announcement, as we read of fanatics denouncing woe on Jerusalem before its final destruction (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:05. 3). The threat was conditional virtually, though expressed in uncompromising terms. In the Hebrew the participle is used, "Yet forty days, and Nineveh overthrown," as though he saw at the end of the specified time the great city lying in ruins. One sees from <a href="../../par/isaiah/36-11.htm">Isaiah 36:11, 13</a>, that Jonah could readily be understood by the Assyrians.

This great result has seemed to some incredible, and has occasioned doubts to be east upon the history. But, as we have seen in the Introduction, Jonah's mission occurred probably at a time of national depression, when men's minds were disposed to expect calamity, and anxious to avert it by any means. Other considerations led to the same result. They had heard much of the God of the Hebrews, much of the doings of his great prophets Elijah and Elisha; and now they had in their midst one of these holy men, who, as they were informed, had been miraculously preserved from death in order to carry his message to them; for that it was thus that Jonah was "a sign unto the Ninevites" (<a href="../../par/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a>) seems most certain. They saw the Divine inspiration beaming in his look, dictating his utterance, animating his bearing, filling him with courage, confidence, and faith. The credulity with which they received the announcements of their own seers, their national predilection for presages and omens, encouraged them to open their ears to this stranger, and to regard his mission with grave attention. Their own conscience, too, was on the prophet's side, and assisted his words with its powerful pleading. <span class="cmt_word">So they believed in God, and proclaimed a fast.</span> Spontaneously, without any special order from the authorities. Before the final fall of Nineveh, the inscriptions mention, the then king ordered a fast of one hundred days and nights to the gods in order to avert the threatened danger (see a note by Professor Sayce, in G. Smith's 'History of Babylon,' p. 156). <span class="cmt_word">Put on sackcloth</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>; <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-27.htm">1 Kings 21:27</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>).

The reigning monarch was probably either Shalmaneser III. or one of the two who succeeded him, Asshur-danil and Asshur-nirari, whose three reigns extended from  <span class="date">B.C. 781</span> to 750. <span class="cmt_word">His robe</span> (<span class="accented">addereth</span>); the word used for the "Babylonish garment" in <a href="../../par/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>.

These great cities contained in their area immense open spaces, like our parks, where cattle were kept. The dumb animals were made to share in their masters' fast and sorrow, as they shared their joy and feasting; their bleating and bellowing were so many appeals to Heaven for mercy; the punishment of these innocent creatures was a kind of atonement for the guilt of their lords (comp. <a href="../../par/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; and note how the brute creation is said to sham in the happiness of paradise regained, <a href="../../par/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>.). The commentators quote Virgil, 'Ecl.,' 5:24, etc., where, however, the point is that the grief of the shepherds hinders them from attending to the wants of their flocks. Herodotus (9:24) mentions an instance of the Persians cutting the manes and tails of their horses and mules in a case of general mourning (comp. Eurip., 'Alcest.,' 428, etc.; Plut., 'Alex.,' 72).

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a></div><div class="verse">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">God accepts this repentance, and the threatened destruction is averted. <span class="cmt_word"></span>God saw their works</span>. There is no notice in the inscriptions of this "repentance," or of any change in the polytheistic worship of the Ninevites. But the existing records of this period are singularly meagre, and show a state of calamity and depression, of internal commotions and famine. Nor is it usual in the monumental history to find mention of any events but wars and the execution of material works; moral reformations are not recorded. <span class="cmt_word">God repented of the evil</span> (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-14.htm">Exodus 32:14</a>). This is an anthropopathical mode of speaking; God acted as if, taking man's view of the transaction, he repented. The sentence was conditional, as Jonah well knew (<a href="../../par/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), in accordance with the great principle laid down in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7</a>, etc., viz. that if a nation against which sentence is pronounced turn from its evil way, the sentence shall not be executed. God does not change, but he threatens that man may change (see note on Amos 7:3; and observe the same principle applied to individuals, <a href="../../par/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8, 13-16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">He did it not.</span> The evil day was postponed. This partial repentance, though it was not permanent and made little lasting  impression on the national life, showed that there was some element of good in these Assyrians, and that they were not yet ripe for destruction. It has been considered to be a proof of the unhistorical character of the Book of Jonah that no mention of any of the incidents is made in the Books of Kings and Chronicles; but there is nothing strange in this. Those records never touch external politics except as closely connected with Israel's fortunes; and, derived as they were from national annals, it would have been unnatural for them to have narrated events happening so far away, and not likely to be introduced in the documents on which their history was founded. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jonah/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jonah 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jonah 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../jonah/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Jonah 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Jonah 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/jonah/4.htm"><title>Jonah 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/jonah/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/jonah/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/jonah/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../jonah/3.htm" title="Jonah 3">&#9668;</a> Jonah 4 <a href="../micah/1.htm" title="Micah 1">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-1.htm">Jonah 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - JONAH'S DISPLEASURE AND ITS CORRECTION. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-4.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">Jonah</span> is <span class="accented">grieved</span> <span class="accented">at the sparing of Nineveh, the expectation of which had led to his former flight, and complains of God's clemency.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It displeased Jonah exceedingly;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it was evil to Jonah, a great evil.</span> It was more than mere displeasure which he felt; he was vexed and irritated. The reference is to what is said in the last verse of the preceding chapter, viz. that the predicted destruction was not inflicted. How the knowledge of this reprieve was conveyed to the prophet we am not informed. It probably was made known to him before the expiration of the forty days by Divine communication, in accordance with the saying in <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (see ver. 5). Various reasons have been assigned for this displeasure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Personal pique, lest, his prediction having failed, he should be liable to the charge of being a false prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Zeal for the honour of God, whose knowledge of the future might be discredited among the heathen, when they saw his own servant's words unfulfilled. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Because he saw in this conversion of Gentiles a token of the ruin of his own people, who remained always hardened and impenitent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> A mistaken patriotism, which could not endure to find mercy extended to a heathen nation which had already proved hostile to Israel and was destined to oppress it still further. This last seem to have been the real ground of his annoyance. So deep was this, that he would gladly have seen the sentence executed even after the city had repented (comp. ver. 11, "Should not I spare Nineveh," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which thou wouldst have me even now destroy?) <span class="cmt_word">He was very angry</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "was confounded."

Jonah throughout represents himself as petty, hasty, and self-willed, prone to exaggerate matters, and easily reduced to despair. Here, because his word is not fulfilled, he wishes to die, though he will not take his own life. In a different spirit Moses (<a href="../../par/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>) is ready to die for his people's sake, and Elijah asked for death because his zeal for God had apparently wrought no effect (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>).

It is also known by the name of the <span class="accented">Palma Christi</span>, and from its seeds is expressed "castor oil." But it is very doubtful whether this is the plant intended. Certainly the <span class="accented">ricinus</span> is never used in the East as a protection against the sun, for which its straggling, open growth renders it unsuitable; while the gourd, as Mr. Tristram testifies ('Land of Israel,' p. 37), is used universally to form trellises for shading arbours and summer houses, and affords a most effectual screen. "Orientals," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 15), "never dream of training a castor-oil plant overs booth, or planting it for a shade, and they would have but small respect for any one who did. It is in no way adapted for that purpose, while thousands of arbours are covered with various creepers of the general gourd family." With this testimony it is well to be satisfied. Whatever the plant was, its growth was abnormal in the present ease, though the rapidity with which it developed was merely a quickening of its ordinary powers, in due accordance with its nature and character.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <i>It is</i> better for me to die than to live.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">Jonah grieves bitterly for the loss of the gourd</span>; <span class="accented">and God takes occasion from this to point out the prophet's inconsistency and pitilessness in murmuring against the mercy shown to Nineveh with its multitude of inhabitants.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A vehement east wind;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="../../par/james/1-11.htm">James 1:11</a>) <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> "a scorching, burning wind;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">vento calido et urenti</span> (<a href="../../par/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>). The word translated "vehement" is also rendered "silent," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> sultry. Pusey and Hitzig rather incline to think it may mean the autumn or harvest wind. Either interpretation is suitable, as, according to Dr. Thomson, there are two kinds of sirocco, equally destructive and annoying - the violent wind, which fills the air with dust and sand; and the quiet one, when scarcely any air is stirring, but the heat is most overpowering ('The Land and the Book,' p. 536, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Beat upon the head</span>. The same word for the effect of the rays of the sun as in <a href="../../par/psalms/121-6.htm">Psalm 121:6</a> and elsewhere. Trochon quotes Ovid, 'Metam ,' 7:804 - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Sole fere radiis feriente cacumiua primis."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"The sun with earliest rays<br />Scarce smiting highest peaks."</span> Rich, 'Koordistan,' 1:125, "Just as the moon rose, about ten, an intolerable puff of wind came from the northeast. All were immediately silent, as if they had felt an earthquake, and then exclaimed, in a dismal tone, 'The sherki is come.' This was indeed the so much-dreaded sherki, and it has continued blowing ever since with great violence from the east and northeast, the wind being heated like our Bagdad sauna, but I think softer and more relaxing. This wind is the terror of these parts." "Few European travellers," says Layard ('Nin. and Babyl.,' p. 366), "can brave the perpendicular rays of an Assyrian sun. Even the well seasoned Arab seeks the shade during the day, and journeys by night unless driven forth by necessity or the love of war" (quoted by Dr. Pusey, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). He fainted (see note on Amos 8:13, where  the fame word is used of the effects of thirst: comp. <a href="../../par/jonah/2-7.htm">Jonah 2:7</a>). His position on the east of the city (ver. 5) exposed him to the full force of the scorching sun and wind. <span class="cmt_word">Wished in himself to die;</span> literally, <span class="accented">asked for his soul to die</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "despaired of his life" (<a href="../../par/1_kings/19-4.htm">1 Kings 19:4</a>). The expression implies that he asked God to grant him his life to do with it what he liked. In his self-will and impatience he still shows his dependence upon God. He may have had in his mind the precedent of his great master Elijah, though his spirit is very different (see note on ver. 3 above). <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die</span>. His wish for death arose from his now assured conviction that God's mercy was extended to the heathen. He argued from the sudden withering of the gourd that he was not to stay there and see the accomplishment of his wishes, and, in his impatience and intolerance, he would rather die than behold Nineveh converted and saved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-9.htm">Jonah 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <i>even</i> unto death.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God said.</span> Keil and others have noted the variety in the use of the names of God in this passage (vers. 6-9). The production of the gourd is attributed to Jehovah-Elohim (ver. 6), a composite name, which serves to mark the transition from Jehovah in ver. 4 to Elohim in vers. 7 and 8. Jehovah, who replies to the prophet's complaint (ver. 4), prepares the plant as Elohim the Creator, and the worm as ha-Elohim the personal God. Elohim, the Ruler of nature, sends the east wind to correct the prophet's impatience; and in ver. 10 Jehovah sums up the history and teaches the lesson to be learned from it. <span class="cmt_word">Doest thou well to be angry?</span> The same tender expostulation as in ver. 4. <span class="cmt_word">I do well to be angry, even unto death.</span> I am right to be angry, so that my anger almost kills me. Deprived of the shelter of the gourd, Jonah is immediately depressed, and in his unreasoning anger defends himself against the reproaches of God's voice within him. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> "I am greatly grieved even unto death," which reminds one of our Lord's words in the garden (<a href="../../par/mark/14-34.htm">Mark 14:34</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-10.htm">Jonah 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord.</span> Jehovah. closing the story, and driving home the lesson with unanswerable force, the prophet himself being the judge. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast had pity;</span> <span class="accented">thou on thy part hast spared</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For the which thou hast not laboured;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "for which thou sufferedst no evil."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <i>also</i> much cattle?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Should not I spare Ninevah?</span> The contrast between the feeling and conduct of God and those of the prophet is very forcible. Thou hast compassion for a plant of little worth, in whose growth thou hast had no concern, to which thou hast no right; should I not pity a great city which is mine, which I have permitted to grow into power? Thou hast compassion on a flower which sprang up in a day and withered in a day; should I not pity this town with its teeming population and its multitude of cattle, the least of which is more worth than any senseless plant, and which I uphold daily with my providence? <span class="cmt_word">Six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> children of tender years, who did not know which hand was the strongest and fittest for use; or, metaphorically, who had no knowledge between good and evil" (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/1-39.htm">Deuteronomy 1:39</a>), at present incapable of moral discernment. This limitation would include children of three or four years old; and, taking these as one-fifth of the population, we should set the inhabitants at six hundred thousand in number. The multitude of these innocent children, who must needs perish if the city were destroyed, is an additional reason why it should be spared. A still further claim for compassion is appended. <span class="cmt_word">And also much cattle.</span> God's mercy is over all his works; he preserveth man and beast (<a href="../../par/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>), and as man is superior to other animals, so are cattle better than plants. The book ends abruptly, but its object is accomplished. Jonah is silenced; he can make no reply; he can only confess that he is entirely wrong, and that God is righteous. He learns the lesson that God would have all men saved, and that that narrow-mindedness which would exclude heathen from his kingdom is displeasing to him and alien from his design. "For thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men in order that they should repent. For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing that thou hast made; for never wouldst thou have made anything if thou hadst hated it But thou sparest all; for they are thine, O Lord, thou Lover of souls" (Wisd. 11:23, etc.).  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../jonah/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Jonah 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Jonah 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../micah/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Micah 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Micah 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
