He does not call himself "an apostle," not because the Thessalonians were newly converted (Chrysostom), or from tenderness to Silvanus who was not an apostle (Estius), or because his apostolic authority was not yet recognized (Jowett), or because he had merely commenced his apostolic labors (Wordsworth); but because his apostleship had never been called in question by the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits this title in the Epistle to the Philippians; whereas he strongly insists upon it in his Epistles to the Corinthians and Galatians, because among them there were many opposed to his authority. <span class="cmt_word">And Silvanus.</span> The same as the Silas of the Acts. He is mentioned as a chief man among the brethren, and a prophet or inspired teacher (<a href="../../par/acts/15-22.htm">Acts 15:22, 32</a>). His Latin name renders it probable that he was a Hellenistic Jew, and, like Paul, he was a Roman citizen (<a href="../../par/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). He was sent with Judas Barsabas from Jerusalem, to convey the apostolic decrees to Antioch; and he accompanied Paul instead of Barnabas on his second missionary journey (<a href="../../par/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>). He suffered imprisonment with Paul at Philippi; and was engaged with him in preaching the gospel in Thessalonica, Beraea, and Corinth. His ministry at Corinth is honorably mentioned by Paul in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-9.htm">2 Corinthians 1:9</a>). After this there is no more mention of Silvanus in the Acts, and it is doubtful whether he was the Silvanus by whom the First Epistle of Peter was conveyed to the Churches of Asia (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-12.htm">1 Peter 5:12</a>). Ancient tradition, erroneously supposing that Silas and Silvanus were different persons, makes Silas the Bishop of Corinth, and Silvanus the Bishop of Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">And Timotheus.</span> The well-known disciple of Paul. He was a native of Lystra, having a Greek father and a Jewish mother (<a href="../../par/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a>). He joined Paul and Silas on their second missionary journey at Lystra, and was with them in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth. He was with Paul on his third missionary journey, and was sent by him on a mission to Macedonia and Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-10.htm">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>), and accompanied him into Asia on his last journey to Jerusalem (<a href="../../par/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>). He was also with Paul during his first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote the Epistles to the Philippians and Colossians (<a href="../../par/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/1-1.htm">Colossians 1:1</a>). Afterwards he resided at Ephesus (<a href="../../par/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>); from which he was recalled to Rome by Paul shortly before his martyrdom (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/4-21.htm">2 Timothy 4:21</a>). The last mention of Timothy is in the Epistle to the Hebrews: "Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-23.htm">Hebrews 13:23</a>). According to ecclesiastical tradition, he became Bishop of Ephesus, and there suffered martyrdom.  Silvanus and Timotheus are associated with Paul in his address to the Thessalonians, not to give weight and authority to his Epistle, but because they assisted him in the planting of the Church at Thessalonica, and were now with him at Corinth, when he was writing this Epistle. Silvanus is placed first, because he was the older and had been longer with the apostle, and, as is evident from the Acts, was at this time the more important of the two (<a href="../../par/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). By being included in the address, they are represented as joint authors of the Epistle with Paul, although they were only so in name. It is possible that Paul employed one of them as his amanuensis in writing the Epistle. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the Church.</span> The word "Church" denotes a select assembly; here, Christians selected from the world. It does not denote in the New Testament, as with us, a building, but the congregation. In Paul's later Epistles, those addressed are called, not the Church, but saints. <span class="cmt_word">Of the Thessalonians.</span> In other Epistles the address is to the city, as Rome, Philippi, Colosse; here it is to the inhabitants. The Church of the Thessalonians was chiefly composed of converted Gentiles, with a small number of converted Jews (see Introduction). <span class="accented">Which is</span>; to be omitted, as not being in the original. <span class="cmt_word">In God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> The characteristic peculiarity of the Church: they are in God and Christ, that is, in fellowship with them, united to them. "In God the Father" characterizes them as not being heathens; "in the Lord Jesus Christ" characterizes them as not being Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Grace be unto you, and peace.</span> The usual apostolic benediction. "Grace" is the Greek and" peace" is the Jewish form of salutation. The Greeks commenced their epistles with wishing grace for those to whom they wrote; and the usual form of salutation among the Jews was <span class="accented">Shalom</span> or "peace;" the apostle combines them, thus intimating that both Greeks and Jews are one in Christ Jesus. In the Pastoral Epistles and in the Second Epistle of John the form is "Grace, mercy, and peace" (<a href="../../par/2_john/1-3.htm">2 John 1:3</a>.), and in the Epistle of Jude it is "Mercy, peace, and love" (<a href="../../par/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">From God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> These words are wanting in some important manuscripts, and are omitted in the R.V. The preponderance, however, of external authority is in their favor. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:2</a></div><div class="verse">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We</span>. Many expositors (Cony-beare, Koch, Jowett) suppose that the plural is here used for the singular; as Paul elsewhere does in other parts of this Epistle. Thus: "Wherefore we would come unto you, even <span class="cmt_word">I Paul,</span> once and again" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:18</a>); "Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left  at Athens alone" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:1</a>). In these verses the pronoun "we" is evidently restricted to Paul. Still, however, Silvanus and Timotheus being mentioned directly before, it is most natural to include them here. <span class="cmt_word">Give thanks to God always for you all.</span> All Paul's Epistles, with the solitary exception of the Epistle to the Galatians, commence with an expression of thanksgiving. <span class="cmt_word">Making mention of you in our prayers</span>; whilst we are engaged in prayer for you. Paul's prayer for the Thessalonians took the form of thanksgiving. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Remembering without ceasing.</span> Some attach the words, "without ceasing," or "unceasingly," to the previous clause; "making mention of you unceasingly in our prayers" (so Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope.</span> These expressions are not to be weakened, as if they were a mere Hebraism for active faith, laborious love, and patient hope. We have here the three cardinal virtues - faith, love, and hope (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>). Elsewhere these graces are combined. Thus again in this Epistle: "Putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:8</a>); and in the Epistle to the Colossians: "Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all saints, for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven" (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-4.htm">Colossians 1:4, 5</a>). By the "work of faith" is not meant faith itself as the work of God (<a href="../../par/john/6-29.htm">John 6:29</a>), but that faith which is energetic, which is active and living, productive of good works. By the "labor, or toil, of love" is not meant that love which is devoted to God, but that love which manifests itself in acts of kindness toward our fellow-Christians and toward the human race. And by the "patience of hope" is meant that constancy which remains unconquered by trials and persecutions. There is a climax here; faith manifests itself by its works - its active exertion; love by its toils - its works of self-denial; and hope by its patience - its endurance amid trials and discouragements. "Remembering, the apostle would say, your faith, hope, and love: a faith that had its outward effect on your lives; a love that spent itself in the service of others; and a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen, when Christ should be revealed" (Jowett). <span class="cmt_word">In our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> These words do not refer to all three virtues (Hohnann), but only to the last, specifying its object, namely, that it is hope in the advent of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is hope s highest expectation, because at the advent the kingdom of Christ will come in its glory. <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of</span> (or rather, <span class="accented">before</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>God and</span> <span class="cmt_word">our Father.</span> These words are to be conjoined with "remembering:" "remembering unceasingly before God and our Father your work of faith," etc. According to the English idiom, the conjunction "and" is dropped - "God our Father." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:4</a></div><div class="verse">Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Knowing</span>; that is, not the Thessalonians themselves, but we, Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus; knowing, being well assured cf. <span class="cmt_word">Brethren beloved</span>, your election of God; or rather, as it is in the margin and in the R.V., <span class="accented">Knowing brethren, beloved of God, your election.</span> By election is meant that act of free grace by which God destines individuals to become believers in Christ. Thus the Thessalonian converts were chosen or elected by God from among their heathen countrymen to become Christians. The ultimate reason of their Christianity was their election of God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a></div><div class="verse">For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">how that</span> (R.V.); or, <span class="accented">because</span>; assigning the reasons for Paul's confidence in their election; and these reasons were two: first, the powerful entrance which the gospel had among them; and secondly, the joyful reception which was given to it by the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">Our gospel</span>; that is, the gospel which was preached by us. <span class="cmt_word">Came not unto you in word only.</span> The gospel came in word, for this was a necessary pre-requisite, but "not in word only," that is, it was not a bare publication or communication in human words. <span class="cmt_word">But in power</span>. Some restrict the epithets which here follow to the teachers, as denoting the mode in which they preached the gospel; but it is better to refer them both to the teachers and the taught. By "power" is not meant miracles, but, in contrast to "word," the power with which Paul and his companions preached, and the impression which the gospel made on the hearers. <span class="cmt_word">And in the Holy Ghost.</span> Here also the reference is, not to miraculous gifts, but to the influences of the Spirit accompanying the preaching of the gospel; such was the efficacy of Paul's preaching that it proved itself to be accompanied by the operation of the Holy Ghost in the conversion of his hearers. There is here an ascent: the gospel came in power, and, what is more, it came in the Holy Ghost. <span class="cmt_word">And in much assurance.</span> By "assurance" here is meant the confidence with which Paul and his fellow-workers preached the gospel to the Thessalonians, and the fullness of conviction with which the Thessalonians received it. <span class="cmt_word">As ye know.</span> An appeal to their knowledge that what he now states is true. <span class="cmt_word">What manner of men we were among you.</span> Alluding to the blamelessness of their behavior when in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">For your sake</span>; namely, that we sought not our own profit or advantage, but your spiritual good. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Now follows the second reason assigned by Paul for his confidence in their election. <span class="cmt_word">And ye became followers</span> (or, <span class="accented">imitators</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of us, and of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">of Christ.</span> By becoming imitators of the apostle, they became imitators of Christ. "Be ye followers of me," writes St. Paul to the Corinthians, "even as I also am of Christ" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-1.htm">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>). The point of imitation did not consist in their cordial reception of the gospel, for that could not apply to Christ; but in their joyful endurance of suffering. <span class="cmt_word">Having received the word in much affliction.</span> We learn from the Acts that the unbelieving Jews stirred up the heathen rabble, and raised a persecution against Paul and his associates, in consequence of which they had to depart from Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4-10</a>). It would appear that, after the apostle had left the city, the persecution, far from abating, rather increased, and the Gentile inhabitants united with the unbelieving Jews against the Christians; the Thessalonian converts suffered from their own countrymen as well as from the Jews (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With joy of the Holy Ghost</span>; that is, not merely spiritual joy, or joy in the Holy Ghost, but joy which proceeds from the Holy Ghost - joy which is produced by him, of which he is the Author. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So that ye were ensamples.</span> The word here rendered "ensamples" literally signifies "types." It is used to denote a form or figure (<a href="../../par/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), a model or likeness (<a href="../../par/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44</a>), a mark or impression (<a href="../../par/john/20-25.htm">John 20:25</a>). Hence, in a metaphorical sense, it came to signify an example, a pattern for imitation. "Now these things are our examples" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To all that believe</span> - to all believers - <span class="cmt_word">in Macedonia and Achaia.</span> These are the two provinces into which ancient Greece was divided by the Romans, each of which was governed by a proconsul Macedonia was the northern portion, including Macedonia proper, Epirus and Illyricum; at first it was divided into four districts, but afterwards united into one province, of which Thessalonica was constituted the capital. Achaia was the southern portion of ancient Greece, including the Peloponnesus, Attica, Boeotia, etc., and, until recently, was nearly of the same dimensions with the modern kingdom of Greece; its capital was Corinth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; or, <span class="accented">because</span> the proof of tiffs praise conferred on the Thessalonians. <span class="cmt_word">From you sounded out.</span> Resounded like the sound of a trumpet. Comp. <a href="../../par/romans/10-18.htm">Romans 10:18</a>, "Their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world." <span class="cmt_word">The word of the Lord.</span> This does not intimate that the Thessalonians by their missionary activity disseminated the gospel, but that from them locally the-gospel had spread. <span class="cmt_word">Not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad.</span> There is a slight difficulty in the construction. The sentence is complete without the addition, "your faith to God-ward is spread abroad," and, therefore, we must consider these words as equivalent to "<span class="accented">from</span> you sounded out the word of the Lord." When the apostle says that "<span class="accented">the</span> faith of the Thessalonians is spread abroad in every place," the meaning is that the report of their joyful reception of the gospel had excited universal attention. There is here a certain use of the figure hyperbole. The words, "in every place," are not to be taken in their full literal sense, but are merely a strong expression for the wide diffusion of the faith of the Thessalonians. Paul uses similar hyperboles in other places, as when he speaks of the faith of the Romans being spoken of throughout the whole world (<a href="../../par/romans/1-5.htm">Romans 1:5</a>), and of the gospel having come into all the world (<a href="../../par/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>). This wide diffusion of the Faith of the Thessalonians, notwithstanding the recent date of their conversion, may be accounted for when we consider that Thessalonica and Corinth were two great commercial cities, from and to which there was a constant coming and going, so that reports might easily be transmitted by merchants and strangers. It has also been suggested that Aquila and Priscilla, who had lately come from Rome (<a href="../../par/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>), must in their journey have passed through Thessalonica, and would bring with them to Corinth such a report of the faith of the Thessalonians (Wieseler). <span class="cmt_word">So that we need not to speak anything</span>; that is, of your faith, as this is already so well known and applauded. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they themselves</span>; that is, the reporters, those in Macedonia, Achaia, and every other place. <span class="cmt_word">Show of us</span>; or, <span class="accented">report concerning us</span> (R.V.) in regard to our preaching or entrance among you. Instead of questions being asked of us by them, as would naturally be expected, they of their own accord give information. <span class="cmt_word">What manner of entering in we had among you.</span> "Entering" here evidently refers, not merely to the outward entrance, the mere preaching of the gospel among the Thessalonians; but to the access, the internal entrance, which the gospel found into their hearts; that is, with what power and fullness of the Holy Ghost we preached the gospel unto you, and with what joy and confidence and contempt of danger ye received it. <span class="cmt_word">And how ye turned to God from idols.</span> This, as already remarked, is one of the proofs that the Church of Thessalonica was chiefly composed of Gentile converts, though, of course, not to the exclusion of the Jewish element (<a href="../../par/acts/17-4.htm">Acts 17:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To serve the living and true God.</span> Two epithets there employed in contrast to the idols of the heathen: "<span class="accented">living</span>," in opposition to dead idols, which were nothing in the world; "true," not in the sense of veracious, but of real in opposition to the imaginary gods of the heathen.

Christ on his departure from this world went to heaven, where he resides, making intercession for us, but from thence he will come to judge the quick and the dead.

Our entrance among you was not powerless, unreal; on the contrary, it was mighty, energetic, powerful. The reference is chiefly to the manner or mode in which Paul and his companions preached the gospel, though not entirely excluding the success of the gospel among the Thessalonians (comp. l Corinthians 15:14, "And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain").

"They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison" (<a href="../../par/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">We were bold in our God to speak unto you.</span> The word here rendered "<span class="accented">bold"</span> denotes boldness or freedom of speech; and hence some render the clause, "<span class="accented">We</span> were bold of speech in our God, so as to speak unto you" (Ellicott). Perhaps, however, as the verb "to speak" follows, it is better to render the clause," We were confident in our God to speak;" or "<span class="accented">emboldened</span> to speak" (R.V., "<span class="accented">we</span> waxed bold"). This boldness or confidence was in our God, that is, on account of our fellowship or union with him. <span class="cmt_word">The gospel of God.</span> The genitive of origin, denoting, not merely that God was the Object, but that he was the Author of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">With much contention</span>; or, <span class="accented">in much conflict</span> (R.V.), alluding to the peril and danger with which Paul preached the gospel in Thessalonica. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">For our exhortation <i>was</i> not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For our exhortation.</span> This word has a twofold signification, denoting both "exhortation" and "consolation;" when it refers to the moral conduct it denotes exhortation, but when it is an address to a sufferer it denotes consolation. In the gospel these two meanings are blended together. <span class="cmt_word">Was not of deceit.</span> Not in the sense of guile, which would be tantological, but simply "<span class="accented">error</span>," without any direct evil intent; our gospel was not a delusion - we were not ourselves deceived. <span class="cmt_word">Nor of uncleanness</span>; a word usually employed to denote sensuality, and in this sense the meaning is - We did not, like the heathen in their worship, give occasion to unclean practices: "<span class="accented">We</span> have corrupted no man" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>). The word, however, may be taken in a more general sense, as denoting impurity of disposition, impure motives: such as the impure desire of applause or of gain, to which the apostle afterwards alludes<span class="cmt_word">. Or of guile.</span> As we were not ourselves deceived, so neither did we attempt to deceive others. The apostle did not adapt his religion, an. Mahomet, to suit the prejudices or passions of men; he did not employ any seductive or temporizing arts; but he boldly went in the face of the prevailing religions of the age, both of the Jews and of the Gentiles. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a></div><div class="verse">But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>; in contrast. <span class="cmt_word">As</span>; according as. <span class="cmt_word">We were allowed.</span> The old English for "approved." <span class="cmt_word">Of God</span>. The word rendered "allowed" signifies tried, tested as gold is tested in the fire, and hence also the result of that trial, "approved." As we were esteemed worthy <span class="cmt_word">to be put in trust with the gospel</span>; entrusted with its publication. <span class="cmt_word">Even so</span>; in this condition of approval and trust. <span class="cmt_word">We speak, not as pleasing men, but God, that trieth.</span> The same verb that is rendered "allowed" in the first part of the verse; hence "proverb," or "approveth." <span class="cmt_word">Our hearts</span>. Not a general statement, "God who is the Discerner of the heart;" but "our hearts," namely, of us, the publishers of the gospel - Paul and Silas and Timothy; thus appealing to God, as the infallible Judge of their sincerity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God <i>is</i> witness:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; confirming the statement that the preachers of the gospel did not seek to please men, but God. <span class="cmt_word">Neither at any time used we flattering words</span>; endeavoring to gain you by flattery and praise; we did not pander to your feelings; we did not soften the demands of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">As ye know, nor a cloak -</span> or pretext - <span class="cmt_word">of covetousness.</span> We did not use the gospel as a pretext to mask our real motive, which was covetousness, pretending to seek your spiritual good, whereas in reality we sought our own advantage. Paul could with perfect confidence appeal to his converts, and say, "I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-33.htm">Acts 20:33</a>). He was free from all sinister motives. "He did not use words such as flattery uses, or pretexts such as covetousness" (Jowett). <span class="cmt_word">God is witness.</span> Paul appeals to the Thessalonians themselves that he had not used flattering words; so now he appeals to God that the motive of his conduct was not covetousness. Men can judge the external conduct, they can hear the flattering words; but God only can know the motive of action - he only can discern the covetousness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor <i>yet</i> of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor of</span> (or, <span class="accented">from</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome.</span> These words admit of two meanings. The apostle may refer to his refusal to seek maintenance from the Thessalonians, and in this sense become a burden to them. But such a meaning does not suit the context; and besides: this refusal of maintenance is afterwards alluded to by the apostle. The reference here is not to maintenance, but to glory: we did not seek glory from you, when we might have been burdensome, when we might have done so. Hence the word is to be taken in the sense of honor, importance; when we might have claimed honor. <span class="cmt_word">As</span> - in virtue of our character as - <span class="cmt_word">the apostles of Christ.</span> Paul does not speak of himself alone, but he includes Silas and Timothy, and therefore the word "apostles" is to be taken, not in its restricted, but in its wider meaning. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But</span>. The apostle now describes iris conduct positively. <span class="cmt_word">We were gentle</span>; a word used of the amiable conduct of a superior toward an inferior, as of a master toward a servant, a prince toward his subjects, or a father toward his children. "The servant of God must not strive, but be gentle toward all men" (<a href="../../par/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>). Some manuscripts read, "We were babes among you" - the difference being only the addition of another letter. <span class="cmt_word">Among you;</span> in our intercourse with you. <span class="cmt_word">Even as a nurse</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">a nursing mother</span>, for the children arc her own. <span class="cmt_word">Cherisheth</span>; the word employed for birds warming and cherishing their young. <span class="cmt_word">Her children.</span> A stronger expression of tenderness and love could hardly be made. Even as a nursing mother dedicates her life for her infant; so, says Paul, we are willing to dedicate ourselves for you. Some important manuscripts read the verse thus: "But we were babes among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children;" but this arises from an obvious error of the transcriber. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-8.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So being affectionately desirous of you</span>; a strong expression in the original: "being filled with earnest love for you." <span class="cmt_word">We were willing.</span> The word denotes a predetermination of the will: "we esteemed it good." <span class="cmt_word">To have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls.</span> An evident climax: not only were we willing to preach the gospel of God to you, but more than this, to sacrifice our own lives for your advantage. The word here rendered "souls" denotes lives; and the meaning is that the apostle was willing to submit to death for the sake of the Thessalonians. The plural "we" still implies Paul and Silas and Timothy. The thought is - As a nursing mother not only nourishes tier children, but is also ready to sacrifice her life for them; so the apostle not only nourished his spiritual children with the pure milk of the gospel, but was ready to sacrifice his own life for their spiritual maintenance; thus expressing in the strongest manner the womanly tenderness of the apostle toward his converts. <span class="cmt_word">Because ye were dear unto us.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>; a proof or confirmation of this dearness of the Thessalonians to the apostle. <span class="cmt_word">Ye remember, brethren</span>; recalling to their recollection his conduct when he was with them. <span class="cmt_word">Our labor and travail</span>. These two terms frequently occur together (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>), and can hardly be distinguished; "labor," or" toil," is active, denoting exertion; "travail" is passive, denoting weariness or fatigue, the effect of the exertion. <span class="cmt_word">For laboring</span>; in its strict meaning chiefly used of manual labor. Paul here refers to his working for his own support as a tent-maker. <span class="cmt_word">Night and day</span>. Night precedes according to the Jewish mode of reckoning. It does not denote that the apostle made up by labor at night the loss of time during the day which his higher duties, as a preacher of the gospel, occasioned; that he wrought at his trade at night, and preached during the (lay; but the phrase, "night and day," denotes incessantly, continually. <span class="cmt_word">Because we would not be chargeable to any of you.</span> Not a proof of the poverty of the Church of Thessalonica; but the reason of this unselfish conduct of the apostle was that no hindrance should arise on his part to the spread of the gospel; that no imputation of selfishness or covetousness should be laid to his charge. As he had done at Thessalonica so the apostle acted in other places. Thus at the time he was writing this Epistle he was working for his support at Corinth (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/11-9.htm">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>). And such was also his practice at Ephesus; for in his farewell address to the Ephesian elders he could appeal to them: "Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me" (<a href="../../par/acts/20-34.htm">Acts 20:34</a><span class="cmt_word">). We preached unto you the gospel of God.</span> Thus freely, without charge.

Paul here changes the image from that of a nursing mother to that of a father; because then he was speaking of his tender care for his converts, whereas here he speaks of the instructions and admonitions which he gave them; as a mother he nourished their spiritual life, and as a father he superintended their spiritual education. "Exhorting and comforting and charging;" representing three modes of the apostle's instructions: "exhorting" denotes also encouraging and consoling; "comforting" denotes supporting and sustaining ("Comfort the feeble minded," <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a>); and "charging" denotes testifying or protesting  - a solemn pressing home of the exhortation to the hearers.

The special mention of persecution by the Jews has its origin in the fact that it was by the unbelieving Jews that Paul was persecuted at Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">For ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen.</span> One of the proofs that the Church of Thessalonica was Gentile in its origin; as these countrymen were evidently Gentiles, being here distinguished from the Jews. From this it would seem that, after Paul and his companions had left Thessalonica, the persecution which arose against the Christians continued, and the Gentiles combined with the Jews in opposing the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Even as they</span> - the Churches of God in Judaea - <span class="cmt_word">have of the Jews.</span> We learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the Jewish Christians in Judaea were exposed to severe persecution from their unbelieving countrymen: Stephen was put to death, and Paul himself, in his unconverted state, was a chief among the persecutors.

Thus Tacitus writes of them: "They are faithful to obstinacy, and merciful toward themselves, but toward all others are actuated by the most irreconcilable hatred (<span class="accented">odium humani generis</span>)." And Juvenal says, "They will not show the road to one who was not of their religion, nor lead the thirsty person if uncircumcised to the common spring." Perhaps, however, the apostle refers here, not to the enmity of the Jews to the human race in general, though perfectly cognizant of their bigotry and intolerance; as this enmity was a perversion of their peculiar distinction as he people of God; but rather to their opposition to his preaching the gospel to the Gentiles - to their extreme reluctance that the Gentiles along with themselves should be admitted into the kingdom of God.

And, accordingly, we learn from the Acts of the Apostles that the unbelieving Jews were the most violent and implacable enemies of the gospel. Of the numerous persecutions mentioned in the Acts, there were only two, namely, those at Philippi and Ephesus, which were not occasioned by the Jews. <span class="cmt_word">To fill up their sins always</span>; so that the measure of their iniquity became full to overflowing.

The remark of Professor Jowett is well worthy of notice: "In the beginning of sin and evil it seems as if men were free agents, and had the power of going on or of retreating. But as the crisis of their fate approaches, they are bound under a curse and the form in which their destiny presents itself to our minds is as though it were certain, and only a question of time how soon it is to be fulfilled." <span class="cmt_word">For the wrath</span>; that wrath which was predicted and is merited by them. "Wrath" is here used for punishment, which is the effect of wrath. <span class="cmt_word">Is come upon them to the uttermost</span>; literally, <span class="accented">to the end</span>. The apostle here refers to the judgments of God, which were impending on Jerusalem and the Jewish people; judgments which were fearfully executed in the awful sufferings they endured in the Jewish war, and in the destruction of their city by the Romans.

And yet it was several years before the apostle revisited Thessalonica; but he here speaks of the short period - a space of six months - which had already separated them; not, as some suppose, that his mind was so full of the ideas of eternity that he overlooked all  divisions of time. <span class="cmt_word">In presence, not in heart.</span> Similar expressions are common in Paul's Epistles, denoting his love for his converts; thus: "Though I be absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit" (<a href="../../par/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire</span>; because our separation has been so short.

Paul here recognizes the personality of Satan, as the author of all evil, the great opponent of God and Christ. We are not informed by what instrumentality this hindrance of Satan took place. It may refer to the various persecutions against Paul, which prevented him returning to Thessalonica, and especially to that persecution raised against him in Beraea by the Jews of Thessalonica (<a href="../../par/acts/17-13.htm">Acts 17:13</a>). In one sense, indeed, the hindrances arose in the way of God's providence, for under its direction all the journeys of Paul were placed, and Satan could not have hindered him from preaching the gospel in any quarter, unless by the Divine permission (comp. <a href="../../par/acts/16-7.htm">Acts 16:7</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>).

The apostle calls the Thessalonians his "hope," not because he anticipates any reward from their conversion, or because their conversion would counterbalance his former persecution of the Christians, but because he hoped to meet them in glory; he calls them his "joy," because he would rejoice with them in their final salvation; and he calls them his "crown of rejoicing," because he regards them as trophies of the victory of the gospel which he preached. Similarly he calls the Philippians "his joy and crown" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-1.htm">Philippians 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Are not even ye</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">are not ye also?</span> - ye as well as other Christians? <span class="cmt_word">In the presence of</span> - before - <span class="cmt_word">our Lord Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">Christ at his coming</span>; at the restoration of his Messianic kingdom.

Some refer the plural to Paul, Silas, and Timothy (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:1</a>); others to Paul and Silas, as Timothy had been sent to Thessalonica; but it is to be restricted to Paul, as is evident from <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/2.htm">1 Thessalonians 2</a>:38 and 1 Thessalonians 3:5, and inasmuch as Paul was left alone at Athens; the plural being here used for the singular. <span class="cmt_word">Could no longer forbear</span>; could no longer restrain our longing and anxiety to know your condition. <span class="cmt_word">We thought it good</span>; a happy translation of the original, expressing both "we were pleased and resolved." <span class="cmt_word">To be left at Athens alone</span>; an expression of solitude. Alone in Athens, in the very metropolis of idolatry. Compare with this the common saying, "Alone in London." In the Acts of the Apostles we are informed that Paul came to Athens alone, and that there he waited for Silas and Timothy (<a href="../../par/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, ]5), and that these fellow-workers rejoined him at Corinth (<a href="../../par/acts/18-5.htm">Acts 18:5</a>). Many expositors, however, from this and the next verse, infer that Timothy at least joined Paul at Athens, but was sent back by him to Thessalonica, to inquire into the condition of his converts in that city. Such is the opinion of Olshausen, Neander, De Wette, Lunemann, Hofmann, Koch, and Schott; and, among English expositors, of Macknight, Paley, Eadie, Jowett, Ellicott, and Wordsworth. There is no contradiction between this view and the narrative of the Acts. Luke merely omits to mention Timothy's short visit to Athens and departure from it, and relates only the final reunion of these three fellow-workers at Corinth. Indeed, Paley gives this coming of Timothy to Athens as one of the undesigned coincidences between this Epistle and the Acts of the Apostles. Still, however, we are not necessitated to suppose that Timothy joined the apostle at Athens. The words admit of the opinion that he was sent by Paul direct from Beraea, and not from Athens; and that he and Silas did not join Paul until they came from Macedonia to Corinth. Such is the opinion of Hug, Wieseler, Koppe, Alford, and Vaughan. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/3-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:2</a></div><div class="verse">And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And sent Timotheus</span>. This was a great act of self-sacrifice on the part of Paul; because to be without an assistant and fellow-laborer in the gospel in such a city as Athens, the very center and strong hold of heathenism, full of temples and idols, must necessarily have brought upon him many discomforts; and yet his anxiety for the Thessalonians overcame all motives of personal convenience. <span class="cmt_word">Our brother, and minister of God, and our fellow-laborer.</span> The reading of manuscripts here varies. Some important manuscripts read, "our brother and fellow-worker with God" - a phrase which is elsewhere employed by the apostle: "for we are laborers together with God" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>). Retaining, however, the reading of the text, Paul here calls Timothy his brothel expressing his esteem and fraternal affection for him; "a minister of God," expressing Timothy's official position and the honor conferred on him by Christ; and his "fellow-laborer," expressing his laborious work in preaching the gospel, and reminding the Thessalonians of his labors among them. Different reasons have been assigned for this eulogy pronounced by Paul on Timothy. Some suppose that it was to show how eagerly he consulted the welfare of the Thessalonians, by sending to them a person of such importance and of such use to himself as Timothy (Calvin); others think that it was to recommend Timothy to the favorable regard of the Thessalonians in the absence of himself (Chrysostom); but it appears to be the natural outburst of affection for his favorite disciple. <span class="cmt_word">In the gospel of Christ.</span> Timothy had labored with Paul and Silas in the publication of the gospel at Thessalonica, and was consequently well known to the Thessalonians, and favorably regarded by them. <span class="cmt_word">To establish you, and to comfort you</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">to exhort you</span>, as the matter of exhortation follows. <span class="cmt_word">Concerning your faith</span>; in order to the continuance and furtherance of your faith. The purpose of the mission of Timothy; namely, to confirm the Thessalonians in the faith, to exhort them to perseverance in Christianity, notwithstanding the persecutions to which they were exposed.

Our afflictions do not result from chance, but are the necessary consequence of our Christianity; they arise from the appointment and ordinance of God. Tribulation is the Christian's portion. Whatever truth there may be in the saying that prosperity is the promise of the Old Testament, affliction is certainly the promise of the New. We must be conformed to Christ in his sufferings. "In the world," says our Lord, "ye shall have tribulation" (<a href="../../par/john/16-33.htm">John 16:33</a>). When our Lord called Paul to his apostleship, he showed him how great things he must suffer for his Name's sake (<a href="../../par/acts/9-16.htm">Acts 9:16</a>). All the apostles suffered from persecution, and concerning Christians in general Paul asserts that it is only through tribulation that they can enter into the kingdom of God (<a href="../../par/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; see <a href="../../par/revelation/7-14.htm">Revelation 7:14</a>).

The temptation to which the Thessalonians were exposed was that of apostasy from Christianity, through the fear or endurance of persecution. That the tempter had tempted them is probable  - it was almost unavoidable; that he had succeeded in his temptation, and had thus rendered the apostle's labors among them useless, was uncertain - a contingency which might possibly have taken place.

Such a distinction is, however, precarious. The words do not refer to the apostle's anxiety on account of the Thessalonians, for that was removed by the coming of Timothy. Clearly some external trouble is denoted. Paul, when he preached the gospel at Corinth, and before he obtained the protection of Gallio, was exposed to much persecution and danger. The Jews had expelled him from their synagogue (<a href="../../par/acts/18-6.htm">Acts 18:6</a>), and attempts had been made against him which at length broke out into an insurrection against him, when he was dragged before the Roman tribunal (<a href="../../par/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>). His condition at Corinth when he wrote this Epistle was dark and gloomy. <span class="cmt_word">By your faith</span>; by the steadfastness of your faith. The good news which Timothy brought of the faith and love of the Thessalonians comforted the apostle amid all the trials and difficulties and disappointments of his ministry (comp. with this passage <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/7-4.htm">2 Corinthians 7:4-7</a>).

The apostle considers his condition of affliction and distress as a kind of death: so, elsewhere he says, "I die daily" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-31.htm">1 Corinthians 15:31</a>); and from which death he was now again raised to life. <span class="cmt_word">If</span>; provided - a hypothetical assumption. <span class="cmt_word">Ye stand fast</span>; continue firm in the faith of the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">In the Lord</span>; the element of true life.

Now follows the subject-matter of his prayer. <span class="cmt_word">That we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith.</span> The faith of the Thessalonians was not perfect; it was "lacking" in several respects. It was defective in extent; they were ignorant of many of the doctrines of the gospel, and had formed erroneous views of other doctrines, such as the second advent. It was defective in application; they had not yet renounced all the corrupt practices of their former heathen life, nor had they embodied all the precepts of the gospel into their actual life. The Thessalonians were as yet but novices. So also the reason which impelled Paul to wish to come to Rome was to supply that which was lacking in the faith of the Roman converts (<a href="../../par/romans/1-11.htm">Romans 1:11</a>). Confirmation was a work in which the apostle delighted, being both important and desirable. In general, faith at first is weak and defective; it is only developed by degrees. Especially is it increased by every increase of spiritual knowledge. "Add to your faith knowledge" (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-5.htm">2 Peter 1:5, 6</a>). The remark of Calvin is worthy of attention: "Paul is desirous of having the opportunity given him of supplying what is wanting in the faith of the Thessalonians, or, which is the same thing, completing in all its parts their faith which was as yet imperfect. Yet this is the faith which he had previously extolled marvelously. From this we infer that those who far surpass others are still far distant from the goal. Hence, whatever progress we may have made, let us keep in view our deficiencies, that we may not be reluctant to aim at something further."

He wrote as the organ or instrument of the Lord Jesus. That as ye have received of us. Paul here appeals to the exhortations which he gave them during his residence among them at Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">How ye ought to walk and to please God</span>; how you ought to conduct yourselves so as to please God. The walking was the means of pleasing. The R.V., after these words, on the authority of manuscripts, adds, "even as ye do walk." <span class="cmt_word">So ye</span> <span class="cmt_word">would abound more and more.</span> The apostle acknowledges their Christian walking; they had already entered upon the road; their conduct was sanctified; but he exhorts them to abound therein with still greater care and fidelity.

We have here, and indeed in this chapter throughout, an assertion of the inspiration of the apostle: the commandments which he gave to the Thessalonians were the commandments of the Lord Jesus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3</a></div><div class="verse">For this is the will of God, <i>even</i> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this is the will of God.</span> The phrase, "the will of God," has two significations in Scripture: the one is the determination of God - his decree; the other is his desire, that in which he delights - a will, however, which may be frustrated by the perversity of his creatures. It is in this latter sense that the word is here employed. <span class="cmt_word">Even your sanctification</span>; complete consecration; holiness taken in its most general so. use. Our holiness is the great design of Christ's death, and is the revealed will of God. Some (Olshausen, Lunemann) restrict the term to moral purity, and consider the next clause as its explanation (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye should abstain from fornication</span>; a vice fearfully prevalent among the heathen, and which, indeed, they hardly regarded as wrong. Especially it was the great sin of Corinth, from which the apostle wrote, the patron goddess of which city was Venus.

The R.V. renders the clause, "that each one of you know how to possess himself of;" hence it admits of the translation, "to obtain the mastery over." <span class="cmt_word">His vessel.</span> This word has given rise to a diversity of interpretation. Especially two meanings have been given to it. By some it is supposed to be a figurative expression for "wife," in which sense the word is used, though rarely, by Hebrew writers. Peter speaks of the wife "as the weaker vessel" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>). This is the meaning adopted by Augustine, Schott, Do Wette, Koch, Hofmann, L&uuml;nemann, Riggenbach; and, among English expositors, by Alford, Jowett, Ellicott, and Eadie. This meaning is, however, to be rejected as unusual and strange, and unsuitable to what follows in the next verse. The other meaning - "one's own body" - is more appropriate. Thus Paul says, "We have this treasure," namely, the gospel, "in earthen vessels" (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>; comp. also <a href="../../par/1_samuel/21-5.htm">1 Samuel 21:5</a>). The body may well be compared to a vessel, as it contains the soul. This meaning is adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Grotius, Bengel, Olshausen, Meyer; and, among English expositors, by Macknight, Conybeare, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Yaughan. <span class="cmt_word">In sanctification and honor.</span> What the apostle here requires is that every one should obtain the mastery over his own body, and that whereas, as Gentiles, they had yielded their members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, they should now, as Christians, yield their members servants to righteousness unto holiness (<a href="../../par/romans/6-19.htm">Romans 6:19</a>).

"An example of the modest reserve and refined delicacy which characterize the holy apostle's language in speaking of things which the Gentiles did without shame, and thus, by a chaste bashfulness of words, commending the duty of unblemished purity in deeds" (Wordsworth). <span class="cmt_word">Because the Lord is the Avenger of all such</span>; either of all such as are thus defrauded or of all such sinful practices. <span class="cmt_word">As we also have forewarned you and testified.</span>

So also Peter said unto Ananias, "Thou hast not lied unto man, but unto God" (<a href="../../par/acts/5-4.htm">Acts 5:4</a>); and our Lord says, "He that rejecteth you rejecteth me" (<a href="../../par/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath also given unto us his Holy Spirit.</span> If this is the correct reading, then the apostle here again asserts his own inspiration, and that in the strongest and plainest terms. The best manuscripts, however, read, "who giveth his Holy Spirit unto you" (R.V.) - a strong enforcement of holiness, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit was given them for the express purpose of producing holiness within them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The apostle now proceeds to a new exhortation. <span class="cmt_word">But as touching brotherly love.</span> Brotherly love is the love of Christians to Christians, that special affection which believers bear to each other; a virtue which was carried to such perfection in the primitive Church as to call forth the admiration of their heathen adversaries. This virtue is often inculcated in Scripture (<a href="../../par/hebrews/13-1.htm">Hebrews 13:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>), and is distinguished from love in general (<a href="../../par/2_peter/1-7.htm">2 Peter 1:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye need not that I write unto you</span>; a delicate and gentle reproof. <span class="cmt_word">For ye yourselves are taught of God.</span> We are not here to think of the new commandment of brotherly love given by the Savior, nor on the Divine compassion exciting us to love; but "taught of God" by the influences of the Spirit on their hearts and consciences to love one another.

Not only to those in Thessalonica, but to all believers in your country and neighborhood. <span class="cmt_word">But we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more; that ye make progress in brotherly love</span> - that it increase in purity, in warmth, and in extent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that ye study</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ye be ambitious. <span class="cmt_word"></span>To be quiet</span>; to avoid unrest, to live in peace. Worldly ambition excludes quietness and prompts to restlessness; so that the apostle's admonition really is, "that ye be ambitious not to be ambitious." The unrest which disturbed the peace of the Thessalonian Church was not political, but religions; it arose from the excitement naturally occasioned by the entrance of the new feeling of Christianity among them. It would also appear that they were excited by the idea of Christ's immediate advent. This had occasioned disorders, and had caused several to neglect their ordinary business and to give themselves over to an indolent inactivity, so that Christian prudence was overborne (comp. <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:6-12</a>). Perhaps, also, the liberality of the richer members of the Church was abused and perverted, so as to promote indolence. <span class="cmt_word">And to do your own business</span>; to attend to the duties of your worldly calling, to avoid idleness. <span class="cmt_word">And to work with your own hands.</span> From this it would appear that the members of the Thessalonian Church were chiefly composed of the laboring classes. <span class="cmt_word">As we commanded you.</span> A precisely similar exhortation is given in the Epistle to the Ephesians: "Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-28.htm">Ephesians 4:28</a>).

So also, in another Epistle, the apostle says, "Walk in wisdom toward them that are without" (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-5.htm">Colossians 4:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That ye may have lack of nothing</span>; either neuter, <span class="accented">of no thing</span>; or perhaps rather masculine, <span class="accented">of no man</span>; that ye be under no necessity of asking assistance either from heathens or from fellow-Christians; inasmuch as working with your hands will put you in possession of what is necessary for life; whereas idleness necessarily involves poverty and dependence on others. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - With this verse the apostle proceeds to another subject, namely, to comfort those who were mourning the death of their friends. It would appear that the Thessalonians were in perplexity and distress concerning the fate of their deceased friends, fearing that these would miss those blessings which they expected Christ to confer at his advent. Their views of the time and nature of the advent and of the future state in general were confused. They expected that Christ would come immediately and establish his kingdom on earth; and consequently they feared that those who had died would be excluded from it. <span class="cmt_word">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren</span>; a phrase often used by the apostle, when he makes a transition to new and important matters (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/1-13.htm">Romans 1:13</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-1.htm">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-8.htm">2 Corinthians 1:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Concerning them which are asleep</span>; or, <span class="accented">are fallen asleep.</span> The death of believers in the New Testament is frequently called "sleep." "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth" (<a href="../../par/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11</a>). Of Stephen it is said that "he fell asleep" (<a href="../../par/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>). "Many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/11-30.htm">1 Corinthians 11:30</a>). "Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-18.htm">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>). "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (l Corinthians 15:51). "He fell asleep" is a common epitaph on early Christian tombstones. It is to be observed that it is not of the dead generally that the apostle speaks, but of the dead in Christ, and especially of those members of the Thessalonian Church who had died. <span class="cmt_word">That ye sorrow not.</span> Some suppose that sorrow for our deceased friends is here utterly prohibited; inasmuch as if we had a firm belief in their blessedness we would rejoice and not mourn. But the sorrow here prohibited is a despairing and an unbelieving sorrow; we are forbidden to sorrow as those who have no hope, no belief in a blessed resurrection. The tears of Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus have authorized and sanctified Christian sorrow. "Paul," observes Calvin, "lifts up the minds of believers to a consideration of the resurrection, lest they should indulge excessive grief on occasion of the death of their relatives, for it were unseemly that there should be no difference between them and unbelievers, who put no end or measure to their grief, for this reason, that in death they recognize nothing but destruction. Those that abuse this testimony so as to establish among Christians stoical indifference, that is, an iron hardness, will find nothing of this nature in Paul's words." <span class="cmt_word">Even as others</span>; literally, as <span class="accented">the rest</span>; namely, the heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Which have no hope</span>; no hope of immortality beyond death, or no hope of the resurrection. The heathen, with very few exceptions, had no hope of a future life, and hence they mourned over the death of their friends as an irreparable loss. This disconsolate feeling is apparent in their writings (for examples, see Lunemann, Alford, and Jowett, <span class="accented">in loco</span>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a></div><div class="verse">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again.</span> The apostle's argument proceeds on the supposition that Christ and believers are one body, of which Christ is the Head and believers are the members; and that consequently what happens to the Head must happen to the members. Our knowledge and belief of a future state, and especially of the resurrection, is founded on the resurrection of Christ (comp. <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-12.htm">1 Corinthians 15:12-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Even so them also which sleep in Jesus</span>; or more literally, <span class="accented">through Jesus. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Will God bring with him</span>; namely, with Jesus. These words are differently construed. Some read them thus: "Even so them also which sleep will God through Jesus bring with him" (De Wette, Lunemann); but this appears to be an awkward construction; as we must then render the clause, "will God through Jesus bring with Jesus." It is, therefore, better to refer the words, "through Jesus," to the first clause. It is through Jesus that believers fall asleep; it is he who changes the nature of death, for all his people, from being the king of terrors into a quiet and gentle sleep, from which they will awaken to eternal life.

It has been affirmed that the apostle here asserts that he himself expected to be alive, with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord's advent; that, according to his expectation, Christ's second coming was close at hand. "Those who are alive and remain" are distinguished from "those who are asleep," and in the former class the apostle includes himself and his readers. And a similar declaration is contained in the First Epistle to the Corinthians: "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed" (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). Such is the view adopted by Grotius, Olshausen, Koch, Neander, Lechler, Baur, Winer, Reuse, Lunemann, Riggenbach; and, among English divines, by Alford, Jowett, Stanley, and Conybeare. Some of them suppose that Paul changed his opinion on this point - that whilst in his earlier Epistles he taught the immediateness of the advent, in his later Epistles he renounced this hope and looked forward to his own departure. There does not seem to be any ground for this opinion. On the contrary, it would appear from the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, written only a few weeks after this Epistle, that Paul did not expect the advent immediately, but mentions a series of events which would intervene before its occurrence (<a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1-3</a>). And in this Epistle he represses the curiosity of the Thessalonians about the precise time of the advent by telling them that it was beyond the sphere of his teaching (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-1.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:1, 2</a>). We consider, then, that the apostle speaks here as a member of the Christian body, and uses a very common form of expression - that we Christians which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord; but not at all intending to express his confidence that he himself and his converts would be actually alive at the advent. "He spake," says St. Chrysostom, "not of himself, but of Christians who would be alive at the day of judgment." Such is the view adopted by Chrysostom, Calvin, Bengel, Hofmann, Lunge, Macknight, Ellicott, Bishop Alexander, Wordsworth, and Vaughan. At the same time, it must be remembered that the time of the advent was expressly concealed (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), and that it might occur at any period; and, by reason of their proximity to the first advent, the primitive Christians would be deeply impressed with the possibility or even probability of its occurrence in their days. Christians were to be living always in readiness for this great event, and thus it became a matter of expectation. "Strictly speaking, the expectation of the day of the Lord was not a belief, but a necessity in the early Church; clinging as it did to the thought of Christ, it could not bear to be separated from him; it was his absence, not his presence, that the first believers found it hard to realize" (Jowett). Hence Paul might not regard the advent as far removed into the distant future, as wholly impossible to happen in his days, but as an occurrence which might at any time take place; but he did not teach anything definite or certain on the subject. <span class="cmt_word">Shall not prevent</span>; go before or anticipate, obtain the preference over, get before, so that those that are asleep might be left behind and fail of the prize. <span class="cmt_word">Them that are asleep</span>; those who are dead, so that they, the living, should be glorified before them, or perhaps hinder their glorification.

Some refer this shout to what follows - the voice of the archangel and the trump of God; but there are three particulars here mentioned. Others attribute it to Christ himself. <span class="cmt_word">With the voice of the archangel</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">of an archangel.</span> There is only one archangel mentioned in Scripture (<a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>); the word denotes, not "chief angel," but "chief or ruler of the angels." Accordingly, same suppose that Christ himself is here meant, as to him alone, it is asserted, does this title belong; but the Lord and the archangel are here evidently distinguished. Others strangely imagine that the Holy Ghost is here meant. Others fix on the archangel Michael (<a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>). Christ is represented as accompanied by angels to the judgment; and it is futile to inquire who this leader of the angels is. <span class="cmt_word">And the trump of God</span>; even as the trumpet sounded at the giving of the Law from Sinai. Also the advent of Christ to judgment is represented as heralded by the sound of a trumpet (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51, 52</a>). "We are to recognize three particulars, following each other in rapid succession - the commanding shout of the King himself, the voice of the archangel summoning the other angels, and the trump of God which awakens the dead and collects believers" (Riggen-bach). <span class="cmt_word">And the dead in Christ shall rise first.</span> Some suppose that the reference here is to the first resurrection; that the righteous, "the dead in Christ," shall rise before the wicked, "the dead not in Christ;" and that a thousand years, or the millennium, will intervene between the first and second resurrections (<a href="../../par/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4, 5</a>). But this is an entirely erroneous supposition. All that is here asserted is that the dead in Christ shall rise before the living in Christ shall be changed; there is no contrast between the dead in Christ and the dead not in Christ, nor any allusion to the resurrection of the wicked.

Our Lord is described as coming to judgment in the clouds of heaven (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>).

The apostle does not here describe the solemnities of the judgment; but stops at the meeting of Christ and his risen saints, because his object was to comfort the Thessalonians under bereavement.

The apostle was comforting the Thessalonians under the loss of their deceased friends by the assurance that both the living and the dead would be gathered together at the advent. The question would naturally arise, "When shall these things be?" (<a href="../../par/luke/21-7.htm">Luke 21:7</a>); and it would appear that the Thessalonians expected an immediate advent. The apostle represses their curiosity on this point by reminding them of the uncertainty of the time of the Lord's coming. <span class="cmt_word">But of the times and the seasons, brethren</span>; that is, of the time and the precise period of the Lord's advent. "Times" and "seasons" are elsewhere united together (<a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>). The word translated "times" denotes time absolutely without regard to circumstances; and the word rendered "seasons" denotes a definite point of time; not merely the day, but the hour (<a href="../../par/mark/13-32.htm">Mark 13:32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Ye have no need that I write unto you</span>; literally, <span class="accented">that ought be written unto you</span> (R.V.); comp. <a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:9</a>. The reason why it was not needful for the apostle to write unto them was, not because he regarded the information unprofitable or superfluous, or because he knew it to be impossible, but because he had already informed them when at Thessalonica that the time of the advent was beyond the sphere of his teaching. The apostle mentions this to repress that vain curiosity which is natural to man, and which was the occasion of so much disorder among the Thessalonians. Our duty is, not to pry into the times and seasons which the Father hath put in his own power (<a href="../../par/acts/1-7.htm">Acts 1:7</a>), but to exercise constant watchfulness. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For yourselves know perfectly</span>; namely, not from Scripture, nor from oral tradition, but from the teaching of the apostle when in Thessalonica. <span class="cmt_word">That the day of the Lord</span>. "The day of the Lord" is a common Old Testament expression, denoting the coming of the Divine judgments (<a href="../../par/joel/1-15.htm">Joel 1:15</a>; <a href="../../par/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>); and by the phrase here is meant, not the destruction of Jerusalem, nor the day of one's death, but the day of the Lord's advent, when Christ shall descend from heaven in glory for the resurrection of the dead and the judgment of the world. The idea of judgment is contained in the term "day." <span class="cmt_word">So cometh as a thief in the night</span>. The same comparison is used by our Lord himself (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-43.htm">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/12-39.htm">Luke 12:39</a>), and the very words are employed by Peter (<a href="../../par/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>). The point of resemblance is evidently the unexpectedness and suddenness of the coming. The thief comes upon people in the night season, when they are asleep and unprepared; so, in a similar manner, when Christ comes, he will find the world unprepared and not expecting his advent. The ancient Fathers inferred from this passage that Christ would come to judgment in the night season, and hence they instituted vigils, or night watches. Some, still more precisely, fixed the coming on Easter night, from the analogy of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt on the paschal evening.

Both must be combined: we must be watchful, on our guard, and we must be sober, armed and prepared; "for even by day," observes St. Chrysostom, "if one watches, but is not sober, he will fall into numberless dangers." The same exhortation is given by Peter, but in the reverse order: "Be sober, be vigilant" (<a href="../../par/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>).

The night is the season in which sleep and drunkenness usually occur; whereas the day is the season of watchfulness, sobriety, and work. Both heathen and Jews considered it as eminently disgraceful for a man to be seen drunken in the day-time. Hence, when the Jews accused the believers on the day of Pentecost with being filled with new wine, Peter answered, "We are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day" (<a href="../../par/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a>).

The apostle now adopts a favorite figure, that of spiritual armor. The arms which he here mentions are only two - the breastplate to protect the heart, and the helmet to guard the head; they are both defensive weapons, because the reference here is not so much to the believer's conflict with evil, as to his defense against surprise. And by these spiritual weapons are denoted the three cardinal graces - faith, love, and hope (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/1-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let us who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love.</span> By "faith" is here meant faith in Christ; and by "love," not so much love to God as love to man. These preserve the heart of a Christian against the assaults and influences of evil, as the breastplate guards the heart of the earthly warrior. <span class="cmt_word">And for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span> Salvation in its most comprehensive sense. The hope of salvation sustains our courage amid all the trials of life by holding out to us the prospect of eternal blessedness. Vigilance is of no avail unless armed by faith, hope, and love. In the Epistle to the Ephesians there is a still fuller enumeration of the Christian armor (<a href="../../par/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14-18</a>); and there is a slight difference in the description of the weapons. Here the apostle speaks of the breastplate of faith and love; there of the breastplate of righteousness and of the shield of faith. Here the helmet is called the hope of salvation; there the apostle speaks of the helmet of salvation. And besides these defensive weapons, other weapons of defense and the sword, a weapon of offence, are mentioned.

The apostle has just been speaking of those who are dead under the designation of those "who are asleep" (<a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>), and therefore it is natural to interpret the clause, "whether we wake or sleep," of the condition of believers at the coming of the Lord. There is here certainly a change of metaphor: "sleep" in ver. 6 denotes religious carelessness; in ver. 7, natural sleep; and here, death. <span class="cmt_word">We shall live together</span> - or, in <span class="accented">one company - <span class="cmt_word"></span>with him.</span> The apostle is still continuing his consolatory address to those who were mourning over their deceased friends; and he tells them that at the advent there will be no difference between those who are then alive and those who sleep - both will live together with the Lord (comp. <a href="../../par/romans/14-8.htm">Romans 14:8, 9</a>).

The apostle adds in conclusion a few brief and somewhat miscellaneous exhortations. <span class="cmt_word">And we beseech you, brethren</span>; an expression of earnestness and affection. <span class="cmt_word">To know</span>; that is, to value, appreciate, and esteem. <span class="cmt_word">Them which labor among you.</span> It was Paul's custom to organize the Churches which he had founded, and to appoint presbyters among them. Although the Church of Thessalonica had been so recently founded, yet it had its presbyters. <span class="cmt_word">And are over you.</span> The presbyters, in virtue of their office, presided over the Christian assemblies. In the Lord; the sphere in which they were set over the Church; they were ordained to minister in sacred things. <span class="cmt_word">And admonish you.</span> There are not three classes or orders of office-bearers here mentioned - those who labored among them, those who presided over them, and those who admonished them (Mac-knight); but all these duties belonged to one class, namely, the presbyters.

Both love for their persons and respect for their authority are here enjoined. <span class="accented">And</span>; <span class="accented">to</span> be omitted, as not in the original. <span class="cmt_word">Be at peace among yourselves.</span> A new exhortation, entirely independent of the preceding; it is not addressed to the presbyters, but to the members of the Church in general. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:14</a></div><div class="verse">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <i>men</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now we exhort you, brethren</span>; an exhortation also addressed to all. <span class="cmt_word">Warn them that are unruly</span>; or, as in the margin, <span class="accented">disorderly</span> (R.V.). Different modes of treatment have to be adapted to different classes; the unruly have to be warned. The word here rendered "unruly" or "disorderly" was originally a military term expressing the character of those soldiers who would not keep their ranks - out of the ranks. It would seem from this and other intimations that disorders existed among the Thessalonians; and that, especially being impressed by a belief in the near approach of the advent, several of them neglected the common duties of life, and abstained from working. <span class="cmt_word">Comfort the feebleminded.</span> By "the feeble-minded" are meant the desponding or faint-hearted; those who were agitated about the fate of their deceased friends, or those who despaired of the grace of God by reason of their sins. These were not to be reprimanded, but comforted and exhorted. <span class="cmt_word">Support the weak.</span> By "the weak" are not meant those who are physically weak - the sick; but those who are spiritually weak, whose faith was feeble - those who were afraid of persecution, or were troubled with vain scruples. These were to be supported - confirmed in the faith, <span class="cmt_word">be patient toward all men</span>; all men in general, whether believers or unbelievers; toward them patience and forbearance were to be exercised.

Joy is that feeling of delight which arises from the possession of present good, or from the anticipation of future happiness; and in both respects the believer has abundant reason for constant joy. He possesses the blessedness of forgiveness and the sure prospect of eternal life, and he has the consciousness that all things work together for good to them that love God (<a href="../../par/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). God wishes his people to be happy, and does not suffer them to be indifferent to their own peace. He commands them to rejoice, yea, to rejoice evermore. "Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice" (<a href="../../par/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).

This prayer is to be "without ceasing," implying constancy (<a href="../../par/colossians/4-2.htm">Colossians 4:2</a>) and perseverance (<a href="../../par/romans/12-12.htm">Romans 12:12</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-18.htm">Ephesians 6:18</a>; <a href="../../par/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1</a>). This is not a mere precept "capable of fulfillment in idea, rather than in fact" (Jowett); but it is an exhortation to live in a devotional frame of mind. It is <span class="accented">impos</span>sible to be always on our bended knees, but we may be in the spirit of prayer when engaged in the duties of our earthly calling. Prayer may be without ceasing in the heart which is full of the presence of God, and evermore communing with him.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:19</a></div><div class="verse">Quench not the Spirit.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - Quench not the Spirit. The Spirit is here considered as a flame which may be extinguished (<a href="../../par/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). The descent of the Spirit at Pentecost was in the form of cloven tongues like as of fire (<a href="../../par/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>). By the Spirit here is usually understood the miraculous gifts of the Spirit - speaking with tongues or prophesyings; and it is supposed that the apostle here forbids the exercise of these gifts being hindered or checked. In the next verse the gift of prophesying is mentioned. But there is no reason to exclude the ordinary and still more valuable gifts of the Spirit, such as pure thoughts, holy actions, devout affections, which may be effectually quenched by a careless or immoral life. "Quench not the Spirit." Do not those things which are opposed to his influences. Be on your guard against sin, as opposed to the work of the Spirit in the soul. In this sense the admonition is similar to that given by Paul in his Epistle to the Ephesians: "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God" (<a href="../../par/ephesians/4-30.htm">Ephesians 4:30</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20</a></div><div class="verse">Despise not prophesyings.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Despise not prophesyings.</span> This refers to the miraculous gift of prophecy possessed by the primitive Church. And by prophesyings here we are to understand, not the prediction of the future, but inspired discourse, conducive to the instruction and edification of the Church. "By the term 'prophesying,'" observes Calvin, "I do not understand the gift of foretelling the future, but the science of interpreting Scripture, so that a prophet is an interpreter of the will of God." This useful gift, it would seem, was apt to be despised, and the inferior miraculous gift of tongues to be preferred before it (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1-3</a>). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a></div><div class="verse">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prove all things.</span> This exhortation is closely connected with the preceding. "Prove all things," namely, whatever was advanced by the prophets in their inspired discourses (comp. <a href="../../par/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>, "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God"). "Prove" here means to test, as metals are tested in the fire; and hence the word frequently denotes the favorable result of the testing, or approval. There was a special gift of discerning spirits in the primitive Church (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/14-29.htm">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>). But although the words primarily refer to the testing of prophetic utterances, yet they have a general application. We should not rest our faith on the authority of others. The right of private judgment is the characteristic and privilege of Protestantism. We ought thoroughly to examine all doctrines by the test of Scripture, and then, discerning their reasons, we shall be able to take a firmer hold of them. At the same time, the fundamental principle of rationalism, that reason as such is the judge of the doctrines of revelation, is not contained in these words, and cannot be inferred from them. <span class="cmt_word">Hold fast</span>; retain. <span class="cmt_word">That which is good</span>; the good, the beautiful, the  honorable; a different word from that rendered "good" in ver. 15. We are to retain whatever is good in those "all things" which we are to prove or test, namely, in the prophesyings. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-22.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:22</a></div><div class="verse">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abstain from all appearance of evil</span>. This verse is connected with the last, and states negatively what is there stated positively. Test the declarations of the prophets; retain the good, and reject the evil. The word translated "appearance" has been differently rendered; it denotes form, figure, species, kind; so that the clause is to be rendered, "Abstain from all form of evil" (R.V.), or, "of the evil," the word being an abstract substantive. The whole exhortation is similar to that given in <a href="../../par/romans/12-9.htm">Romans 12:9</a>, only there the negative statement is put first: "Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good." Some suppose that the metaphor employed is from the practice of money-changers who tested the money offered to them, rejecting what was base and retaining what was genuine. Among the Fathers we meet with the phrase, "Be ye experienced money-changers," as a traditionary saying of our Lord; and some suppose that the apostle refers to this saying, and give the following paraphrase: "The good money keep; with every sort of bad money have nothing to do; act as experienced money-changers: all the money presented to you as good, test." Such a supposition is fanciful and far-fetched. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a></div><div class="verse">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <i>I pray God</i> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the very God of peace</span>; the God who communicates peace; an expression frequently employed by Paul at the close of his Epistles (<a href="../../par/romans/15-33.htm">Romans 15:33</a>; <a href="../../par/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/4-9.htm">Philippians 4:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-11.htm">2 Corinthians 13:11</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-16.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Sanctify you wholly</span>; that is, perfectly, without anything wanting, referring to the entireness of the sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail. <span class="cmt_word">And I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body</span>; the adjective "whole" applies to all the three substantives. The apostle here divides human nature into three parts - spirit, soul, and body; and this threefold division is not a mere rhetorical statement: "The apostle pouring forth from the fullness of his heart a prayer for his converts" (Jowett); but a distinct statement of the three component parts of human nature. The "spirit" is the highest part of man, that which assimilates him to God; renders him capable of religion, and susceptible of being acted upon by the Spirit of God. The "soul" is the inferior part of his mental nature, the seat of the passions and desires, of the natural propensities. The "body" is the corporeal frame. Such a threefold distinction of human nature was not unknown among the Stoics and Platonists. There are also traces of it in the Old Testament, the spirit, or breath of God, being distinguished from the soul. <span class="cmt_word">Be preserved blameless</span>. "The spirit is preserved blameless at the advent when the voice of truth rules it, the soul when it strives against all the charms of the senses, and the body when it is not abused as the instrument of shameful actions" (Lunemann). Unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

He who calls you to the Christian faith is faithful to fulfill his promises. God's calling is the commencement of a series which terminates in glorification (<a href="../../par/romans/8-30.htm">Romans 8:30</a>). A similar appeal to the faithfulness of God is elsewhere made by the apostle (<a href="../../par/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who also will do it</span>; namely, will preserve you blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The apostle, in almost all his Epistles, requests from his converts an interest in their prayers (<a href="../../par/romans/15-30.htm">Romans 15:30</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/1-11.htm">2 Corinthians 1:11</a>; <a href="../../par/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a>; <a href="../../par/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="../../par/2_thessalonians/3-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:1</a>; comp. <a href="../../par/hebrews/13-18.htm">Hebrews 13:18</a>).

The reference is to the mode of salutation in the East. The kiss is called "holy" because it was the symbol of Christian affection. The same exhortation is made in other Epistles (<a href="../../par/romans/16-16.htm">Romans 16:16</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/16-20.htm">1 Corinthians 16:20</a>; <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/13-12.htm">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>).
