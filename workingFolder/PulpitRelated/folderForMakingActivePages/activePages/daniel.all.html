The three chapters (10, 11, and 12.) form a section apart from the rest of Daniel. One marked peculiarity is the long and very old interpolation which occupies nearly the whole of ch. 11. Not improbably something has dropped out, and. not a few things have been modified in consequence of this interpolation. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the third year of Cyrus King of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long; and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision</span>. The Septuagint rendering is, "In the first year of Cyrus King of the Persians." This is at variance with all other versions. As, however, these other versions are derived from the Palestinian recension, they unitedly do not much more than counterbalance the LXX, "A decree (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) was revealed to Daniel who was called Beltasar, and the vision is true and the decree." This is a case of doublet. Evidently some Egyptian manuscripts read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hazon</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">haddabar</span>), and this, or the rendering of it, has slipped into the text from the margin. "And a strong multitude understood the decree." The translator here has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>,  not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, before him. Aquila has the same reading; here <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) is taken in its usual sense of "<span class="accented">host</span>," "And I understood it in vision." Here the LXX. has <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>. From the fact that the first person appears in the next verse, there is at least a probability in favour of this reading. Theodotion is, as usual, closer to the Massoretic. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The text before him has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, the hophal, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, which is possibly the kal. The Peshitta seems to have used a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes; the same is true of the Vulgate. The Peshitta renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> by <span class="accented">heel</span>, and the Vulgate by <span class="accented">fortitudo</span>. <span class="accented">In the third year of Cyrus.</span> The various reading of the Septuagint is of value. It is not to be dismissed as due to a desire to harmonize this date with that in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-21.htm">Daniel 1:21</a>, for the numeral "third" might easily be an accidental mistake present in some few Palestinian manuscripts due to the beginning of the eighth chapter. The first chapter, as we have seen, has many traces that it is at once an epitome and a compilation. It is evident that the writer in the first chapter would have the rest of the book before him, and would mean to harmonize his statements with that of the chapter before us. It seems difficult to imagine that the compiler of the first chapter could have this statement before him, and yet write as he did. We should therefore be inclined to leave the question doubtful. Even if it should be admitted that the Massoretic date is correct, as we have already seen, the difficulties created are by no means insuperable. Hitzig has made it a difficulty that Daniel did not avail himself of the permission to return to his own country, granted by Cyrus. Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span>, "For those who believe Daniel to be an ideal figure, no explanation is necessary." In that assertion he is mistaken. If Daniel were presented as an ideal Jew, why does he not conform to the ideal of Judaism? The statement that Daniel was a man of nearly ninety years of age at the date of <span class="accented">Cyrus's</span> proclamation is a sufficient answer to this difficulty. Hitzig thinks he rebuts this answer of Havernick's by referring to the old men (<a href="../../par/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>) who remembered the former temple; but these might have been children of ten or twelve when they were carried away captive eighteen years after Daniel, and thus might not be more than sixty when Cyrus's decree came. Further, we know that only a very limited number of Jews returned, and that so many of the best of the Jews remained that it was declared that the chaff came to Jerusalem, but that the finest of the wheat remained in Babylon. <span class="accented">A thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called Belteshazzar.</span> "Thing" is the general term <span class="accented">dabar</span>, which means sometimes "decree," sometimes "word," or sometimes, as rendered by the Authorized, " thing." As Professor Fuller remarks, this is to be taken as the title of the rest of the remaining sections. The recurrence of the Babylonian name "Belteshazzar" may be due to the recency of the overthrow of the Babylonian monarchy. <span class="accented">And the thing was true</span>, <span class="accented">but the time appointed was long.</span> Hitzig thinks that in the first clause the author betrays his standpoint, as he would not know the thing was true till fact had proved it so. But, besides that an editor might have added this clause, a man might well be certain of the truth of a thing he had got from God; he might wish to impress this upon his hearers. The last clause here is certainly mistranslated in the Authorized. <span class="accented">The time appointed was long.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) never means "appointed time," although it is twice translated so in Job, as here; but in all these cases with greater accuracy render "warfare." With this sense is to be compared the use we find in <a href="../../par/numbers/15-23.htm">Numbers 15:23</a>-43, where the Levites' service in the sanctuary is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>). If we are to keep to the Massoretic reading, then the rendering of the Revised is really the only one to be thought cf. Professor Bevan, following Ewald, thinking that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> means in ch. 8:1:4 "temple service," would apply this meaning here. As we saw, in considering that verse, the word there was of very doubtful authenticity, we need not apply that meaning here, as it would only suit by being twisted into "obligation." Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Zockler, Keil, and others regard this word as meaning "difficulty," "oppression." Something may, however, be said for the Septuagint rendering, all the more that it was adopted by Aquila. According to these renderings, we conjoin these words, great hosts, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, with the next, which they understand read as third person singular imperfect kal, or omit the conjunction, "And a great multitude understood the decree." "The host" in this interpretation would here naturally mean "the host of heaven." We find that throughout this chapter, and in the twelfth, we have to do with the angels, so it is natural that in this title and summary of what is to follow the fact that the great host of heaven understood this mystery should be stated. Theodotion's rendering, "power," though supported by Jerome in the Vulgate, need not detain us. The view of Jephet-ibn-Ali is that the host may be of Edom, probably meaning by this Rome. <span class="accented">And he understood the thing</span>, <span class="accented">and had understanding of the vision.</span> This is a fairly correct rendering of the Hebrew. Von Lengerke would make the verbs imperative, which certainly they might be, so far as form goes, but the intrusion of imperatives here into the title of a section seems violent. The main difficulty, moreover, is not touched. As they stand, these two clauses assert the same thing, and if with Yon <span class="accented">Lengerke</span> we make them both imperatives, we have the difficulty still present with us. It may be a case of "<span class="accented">doublet."</span> This is an hypothesis we scarcely would adopt except in necessity, since the Septuagint has both clauses. Theodotion, however, has only one of them. We feel ourselves inclined to follow the reading of the Septuagint. The angels understood the matter, and he - Daniel - understood it also by the vision. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a></div><div class="verse">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks</span>. The versions are close to the Massoretic, only the Septuagint, and, following it, the Vetus, as quoted by Tertullian, omit "days," in the literal rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "weeks of days". <span class="accented">Mourning.</span> Zockler and Fuller think this mourning due to the difficulties the released captives had in carrying out their desire of rebuilding the temple. It may have been that he was grieved that so few of the people were willing to avail themselves of the privilege. We are here assuming that the chronology of this passage reckons from the overthrow of Nabunahid, that is, from Cyrus's accession to the throne of Babylon; but, as we have seen, this "third year" may be reckoned from his assumption of the title King of Persia, <span class="accented">San Parsua</span>, in which case it may be the same year with that vision narrated in the previous chapter. <span class="accented">Three full weeks</span>; literally, <span class="accented">three weeks of days</span> - to mark off the duration of Daniel's fast from the weeks of years referred to in the ninth chapter. Keil objects to this interpretation, but assigns no reason. At the same time, it is to be observed that "year of days" means a full year, but a week is such a short period that the necessity of saying that it was complete by defining it a "week of days" is not so obvious, and is unexampled. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a></div><div class="verse">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did</span> <span class="cmt_word">I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> The versions are in perfect agreement with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">Pleasant bread</span>; "bread of desires" is the rendering of the Septuagint and of Theodotion; the word is the same in Hebrew and Greek as that applied to Daniel. <span class="accented">Neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth.</span> This shows that the practice adopted by Daniel and his fellows during their training was not regarded by Daniel, at least as incumbent on him after he could regulate his own affairs. His ordinary habit was to eat flesh and to drink wine; but during these weeks of fast, he denied himself these dainties. <span class="accented">Neither did I anoint myself at all</span>, <span class="accented">till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</span> The pleasure of anointing the body with oil was highly esteemed among the ancients. It is impossible to fail to recognize, in this passage, the origin of the Essenian discipline. The Essenes abstained, from flesh, from wine, and from anointing themselves. Daniel thus abstained, as a sign of sorrow for the <span class="accented">sin</span> of his people; they made this fast a perpetual discipline. They waited for the salvation of Israel, and endeavoured, by fasting, to hasten the coming of the Lord. The converse of this, that Daniel's fast is derived from the Essene discipline, is not to be thought cf. It is a sign of a later development, when such practices of self-denial, from being the incidents of a life which occur on special occasions, become its rule. As early as  <span class="date">B.C. 106</span> an Essene is mentioned teaching in the temple, and mentioned with no evidence that his sect was a thing of recent origin. The limits are narrow between the critical date of Daniel and this date that within them so prominent a sect as the Essenes should spring up. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-4.htm">Daniel 10:4</a></div><div class="verse">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which <i>is</i> Hiddekel;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel</span>. The LXX. differs from this only in rendering Hiddekel by its Greek name "Tigris." Theodotion subjoins to Tigris <span class="accented">Eddekel</span>, on the same principle that we have on the margin of our Bibles different renderings from those in the text. The Peshitta makes the river the Euphrates. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint. There seems no reasonable doubt that Behrmann is right in regarding the <span class="accented">Phrat</span> of the Syriac as a gloss. It certainly was a natural suggestion, that, as Babylon was on the Euphrates, Daniel should rather be found walking there at the termination of his fast, than forty or fifty miles off. <span class="accented">The four and twentieth day of the first month</span>; that is, the month Nisan or Abib - the month in which the Passover was celebrated in every Jewish home. It would seem that Daniel did not join in this festival at this time. It is noted that, from the days of Saul, the two first days of every month were devoted to a feast, and hence, that Daniel's fast could only begin on the third day. Since-he mast have refrained from partaking of the Paschal lamb, we cannot deduce that he might not occupy the opening days of the month with sadness rather than feasting. If Daniel is an ideal figure, intended to represent the model Jew resident in a  foreign land, why is he thus represented as not partaking of the Paschal feast? It is true that, with the temple in ruins, the Paschal lamb could not be slain in the way enjoined in the Law; but the modern Jew keeps the Passover without the lamb. <span class="accented">I was by the side of the great river</span>, <span class="accented">which is Hiddekel.</span> The name is a transference of the Assyrian name <span class="accented">Iddiklat.</span> It would seem that Daniel was then on the banks of the Tigris, not in vision, but in actual person, as here there is no reference, as in <a href="../../par/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>, to his being there in vision; the mention of attendants also renders it unlikely that it was only in vision that Daniel was on the banks of the Tigris. His purpose in being there was probably governmental, as he had attendants with him. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a></div><div class="verse">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins <i>were</i> girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphas: his body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude</span>. The version given by the Septuagint exhibits traces of confluence, "And it was [apparently reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayyehee</span>)] on the four and twentieth day of the first month, I was upon the bank of the great river Tigris, and I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man clothed in fine linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), and girt about the loins with fine linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;</span>), and from his middle there was light, and his month was as the sea, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, his arms and feet as gleaming brass, and the voice (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;</span>) of his speech as the voice of a multitude." It would seem that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> twice; that might be due to blunder, or may be a case of doublet - a phenomenon so frequent. The difficult word <span class="accented">Uphaz</span>, which only occurs elsewhere in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>, is omitted; "from his middle there was light" is probably an effort to render this clause, which the translator seems to have read <span class="accented">mithoq 'or</span>. Possibly the mysterious clause, "and his mouth was like the sea," may be another attempt to render these unaccustomed words. Theodotion merely transliterates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>, and regards <span class="accented">Uphaz as a</span> garment, which, in the case before us, was golden (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>). In the Syriac of the Peshitta, the translator escapes the difficulty of <span class="accented">bad</span>, <span class="accented">deem</span> by rendering it "glory." The next clause is also paraphrastic, "the girdle of his loins (back) was of splendid magnificence:" this last is his rendering of <span class="accented">Uphaz.</span> The next verse does not call for remark. Jerome, in the Vulgate, renders <span class="accented">tarsheesh </span>as <span class="accented">chrysolithus</span> - an interpretation very generally followed now. In the Massoretic text, the use of the numeral "one," almost as our indefinite article, has to be noted. <span class="accented">Baddeem is</span> the plural of a word used mainly for the material of which the garments of the priests were made; it occurs also in the vision of Ezekiel. The singularity is that in Ezekiel, as in Daniel, the word is always plural whereas in the rest of Scripture it is always singular. <span class="accented">Uphaz</span> occurs, as above mentioned, only in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-9.htm">Jeremiah 10:9</a>; it is by some supposed to be a variation on Ophir. As here, it is connected in Jeremiah with Tarshish. F&uuml;rst suggests <span class="accented">paz</span>, "fine gold" (<a href="../../par/job/28-17.htm">Job 28:17</a>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> -  <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. "coast or island," thus making it equivalent to "<span class="accented">Gold</span> Coast." <span class="accented">Kethem</span>, "fine gold," is associated in <a href="../../par/isaiah/13-12.htm">Isaiah 13:12</a> with "Ophir," as here with" Uphaz;" this might hint at the identity of the two places. That, however, is an uncertain basis. The fact that Tarshish and Uphaz are brought together, would indicate that, like Tarshish, it was in Spain. Kneucker, in Schenkel's 'Bibellexikon,' decides for Hy-phasis, South Arabia, on the uncertain ground of the sound of the name. Bochart would place it in Ceylon, because Ptolemy mentions a harbour and river of the name of Phasis. Tarshish is the Tartessus of the Greeks and the modern Tharsis; here the chrysolite or topaz, as brought from thence. <span class="accented">Margelothayo</span>, "his feet," is the most common rendering; but yon Lengerke would render, "the place where his feet rested"  - a rendering which, while it suits the form of the word, does not suit the context. It occurs four times in Ruth in one connection, and not elsewhere, save here. "Like in colour to polished brass" is a phrase which occurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>. Professor Bevan says, "What meaning the author attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qalal</span>),' 'polished,' it is impossible to say." All the versions render" gleaming," in both passages; there seems no need to suggest a corruption of the text. The vision here has a great resemblance, though with many pointsof contrast, to <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4-25</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/8-2.htm">Ezekiel 8:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/10-1.htm">Ezekiel 10:1-22</a>. Many passages in the Apocalypse show traces of its influence: thus <a href="../../par/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14, 15</a>, the appearance of our Lord; also <a href="../../par/revelation/10-1.htm">Revelation 10:1-3</a>. The vision in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1</a>. is a theophany; this, however, is not the appearance of a direct symbol of God, but the appearance of one of his angels. The whole aspect is one of terror and splendour. It has been noted that the yellow gleam of the topaz suits well the tint of the Oriental complexion. When we compare this with Ezekiel's vision, we find a reticence in Ezekiel's description; he does not affirm (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>) that it is a man he sees, but only one in human likeness. Whereas Daniel distinctly  says that it was a man. In the case of Ezekiel, it was a theophany which he saw; it was an angelophany which appeared to Daniel. "The voice of a multitude" refers to the sound of the shout of a multitude; the effect it produces is not merely the volume of sound, but the difference of tones and the difference of moment of utterance give a sense of vastness and multitudinousness, always impressive, and indeed awe-inspiring.

A yet finer parallel is <a href="../../par/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12-16</a>. Eliphaz there describes a spirit passing before him, although invisible; yet in the horror of contact with the spiritual, all his bones shook and the hair of his flesh stood up. There is a difference to be noted here between the conduct of the attendants of Daniel and those of the Apostle Paul. As we read here, the attendants of Daniel flee to hide themselves, those of the apostle are first struck to the earth and then stand stupefied. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</span> The versions do not call for much remark. The LXX. renders "glory" by "spirit" or "breath;" and the Peshitta renders it by "body." The Massoretic is superior, as more difficult and more likely to be the source of the other two than either of them. Theodotion's rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span>, confirms this. Daniel explains how he alone had seen the vision, and narrates the effects contact with the spiritual had on him, "There remained no strength in me;... And I retained no strength" - a redoubled statement of weakness not necessarily meaning, as Jephet-ibn-Ali would have it, that the one refers to his inability <span class="accented">to</span> flee like his attendants, and the other to his inability to stand upright. It is probably due merely to the great impression this sudden powerlessness made on him. <span class="accented">For my comeliness was turned in me into corruption.</span> From the natural brightness of the skin in life the face assumed the yellow pallor of death (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/7-28.htm">Daniel 7:28</a>). "And my countenance was changed in me;" comp. also <a href="../../par/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>, "When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones." While the ideas here are the same, the parallelism is made more striking by the difference of the terms. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-9.htm">Daniel 10:9</a></div><div class="verse">Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</span> The Septuagint rendering here is briefer than the Massoretic, "And I heard the sound of his speech (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>, ' talking'), and I was fallen upon my face upon the earth." The Septuagint translator seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">nephalti</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nir'dam</span>). Theodotion is somewhat nearer the Massoretic text, but renders <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by "stupefied." The Pesifitta is an accurate rendering of the text behind the Septuagint. Jerome agrees with Theodotion, rendering <span class="accented">nirdam</span> by <span class="accented">consternatus</span>; he strengthens the phrase, "my face toward the ground," by inserting <span class="accented">haerebat.</span> It would seem that <span class="accented">nirdam</span> is of doubtful authenticity. It may be said this was omitted because of the difficulty of imagining the prophet seeing while in a deep sleep. But a state of sleep does not preclude the possibility of seeing a vision. In the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>) the LXX. has no difficulty in translating, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>. By assuming the reading of the LXX. and the Peshitta to be correct, we make the process of events more natural; according to the Massoretic reading, though we have an account of his sense of weakness, we have no record that he <span class="accented">fell</span> to the ground, and yet we are told that he was "in a deep sleep, with his face toward the ground" The resemblance is very great to <a href="../../par/job/4-12.htm">Job 4:12</a>, "A thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof in thoughts from the vision of the night, when sleep falleth on men (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)." If there has been imitation, the originality and beauty of the  passage in Job render it certain that it is the original. It seems more likely to be a change introduced to bring the revelation to Daniel in line with other prophetic revelations. The attitude Daniel assumed was one which implied the deepest abasement  - the envoy of the great king kisses the ground at the feet of the envoy of the King of kings. Even the revelation given while sleep had fallen on the subject of the revelation, seems paralleled with what took place at the Transfiguration (<a href="../../par/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>, "And Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep," yet it was when they were awaked that they saw the glory). So with Gethsemane. The Hebrew word is the same as that used when Eve was taken out of the side of Adam; he then was asleep - a deepsleep had fallen on him, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tardaymah</span>)."

This is given in the margin of the Revised, "Set me tottering on my knees," etc. Strangely enough, the LXX. renders, "soles of my feet " - an impossible attitude; that this is the true reading of the LXX. is confirmed by Paulus Telleusis. Theodotion omits "the palms of the hands." The Peshitta renders as the LXX. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> by <span class="accented">articulos</span>, "joints." <span class="accented">An hand touched me</span>. The hand of him that appeared to him - though Daniel does not say. It is needless to multiply angelic agencies. A discussion has been raised on the question whether this is Gabriel who appeared to Daniel in the eighth chapter, or Michael, or the angel of the presence. It is not a matter of importance, but Michael is excluded by ver. 13, and also, to our thinking, "the angel of the presence," if by that title the Second Person of the Trinity is indicated. <span class="accented">Which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.</span> Although the touch communicated to Daniel some strength, yet he was unable to raise himself so as to look up - his face was still to the ground, his attitude was still one of abasement, and he was trembling.

As the language used was one intelligible to Daniel, it was needless to command him to understand the words, but the "matters" communicated by the words might require a special effort of attention to comprehend. <span class="accented">Debareem</span> means "matters" as well as "words." <span class="accented">And stand upright</span>; "'stand upon thy standing." Gesenius would render this word when it occurs before (<a href="../../par/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>), "place;" but both here and there the contrast is in the attitude. From being absolutely prone, as in the eighth chapter, or on hands and knees as here, he is to be upright, and, <span class="accented">taking</span> his previous attitude into account, this is not merely to stand where he is, and neither approach nor depart. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>; the Vulgate has <span class="accented">gradu.

The whole process of humiliation, fasting, and prayer was allowed to go on to its completion before Gabriel came, in order to deepen in Daniel the desire for the hoped-for revelation, and thus enhance the joy of it when it came, and, perchance, also to justify to higher intelligences the giving of this special communication (comp. <a href="../../par/daniel/9-20.htm">Daniel 9:20</a>) as to the answer being ready even while the petition was being put up. <span class="accented">And I am come for thy words.</span> Professor Fuller sees in this an additional  tenderness.

The rendering of the LXX. is, "And the general (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) of the King of the Persians withstood me one and twenty days, and behold Michael, one of the first princes, came to help me, and I left him there with the general of the King of the Persians." The sense of Theedotion is nearly the same as the LXX., only he has <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>. Like the LXX., Thee-dotion declares that Michael was left with the Prince of Persia. The Peshitta agrees more with the Massoretic, but, like the LXX. and Theedotion, it is with the "Prince" of Persia that there is some one remaining. The Peshitta here, in opposition to the Greek versions, has the statement that Gabriel remained, not Michael. The Vulgate agrees still further with the Massoretic, only instead of the plural "kings," it has "king." The most important differences are in the last clause, where the LXX. and Theodotion must have had the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;</span> where the Massoretic has the niphal. Gratz adopts this reading, which certainly has the advantage of making sense of an otherwise unintelligible passage. Professor Bevan, in his easy way, suggests this to be probably a mere guess, the insertion of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>, and the substitution of a transitive for an intransitive verb are quite in the manner of the LXX. translators. He forgets that Theodotion also has this variation, and also that, without any justification from the versions, he himself has suggested various readings. He does not observe that this interpretation affords a reason for Gabriel's presence with Daniel. Michael relieved him in his opposition to the Prince of Persia. The other variant, "prince" instead of "king," has the support of all the versions. <span class="accented">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days.</span> That is to say, during the whole of Daniel's fast. The angelology of later Judaism is a very complicated, not to say confused, subject. The angelology of one age is not that of another; and the angelology of the Jews in one country is not that of the Jews in another. The Jews themselves understood that the Babylonian captivity did a great deal to develop the doctrine of the angels; the Jewish tradition was that they brought back from Babylon the names of the angels. Not only had their residence in Babylon defined the Jewish ideas as to the names f the angels, they began to have clearer ideas of their functions. They reached the idea that every race had its guardian angel. This view is expressed in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, according to the Septuagint, "He set bounds for the nations according to the number of the angels of God." To a similar purport is Ecclus. 17:17, "To each of the nations he appointed a leader, and Israel is the portion of the Lord." There seems, however, a preparation for this in <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-21.htm">Isaiah 24:21</a> (comp. also <a href="../../par/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>). As independent of revelation there is a strong inherent probability that there are races of beings of intelligence and might vastly superior to man, there is nothing inherently improbable in these intelligences being employed by the Almighty in furthering his providential scheme. Men are instruments of God; is it not at least not improbable that, if there are angels, they, too, co-operate with God in the working out of his great purpose? That every nation should have an angelic prince over it is not more extraordinary than that every Church should have a special angel over it (<a href="../../par/revelation/1-20.htm">Revelation 1:20</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/2-2.htm">Revelation 2:2</a>, etc.). That there should be conflicts between these angelic princes is simply to say they are finite. Hitzig's reference to <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> is not to the point, for there is no indication of warlike opposition here. By the indications here, we might judge that the opposition of the Prince of Persia was to the coming of Gabriel to reveal to Daniel the purpose of God. We know nothing of the means employed in the opposition, or of the reason of it. Keil and Kliefoth have the idea that Gabriel was striving to influence the King of Persia, but was hindered in his efforts by the "Prince of Persia;" this is scarcely berne out by the context. <span class="accented">But</span>, <span class="accented">lo</span>, <span class="accented">Michael</span>, <span class="accented">one of the chief princes</span>, <span class="accented">came to help</span> me. Michael ("Who is like God?") is, in the twenty-first verse, declared to be the "prince" of the Jewish people, therefore equivalent to "the captain of the host of the Lord" (<a href="../../par/joshua/5-14.htm">Joshua 5:14</a>). He is referred to in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and <a href="../../par/jude/1-9.htm">Jude 1:9</a>. Where he is called one of "the chief princes," there is reference to an angelic hierarchy, whether the same as that we find developed in the Book of Enoch or not cannot be decided certainly. In the Book of Tobit 12:15 Raphael declares himself "one of the seven holy angels who present the prayers of the saints, and who go in and out before the glory of the Holy One." The Book of Tobit seems to have been written about  <span class="date">B.C. 400</span>; hence this is an indication of opinion before the Books of Enoch. In the Enoch books not only are the great  angels mentioned, but their names arc given, and functions are assigned to them; but they are numbered as four, not seven. Enoch is posterior to Tobit, and finds a place for Michael, Raphael, and Gabriel. We have no means of testing whether the number of the chief angelic princes, of whom Michael was one, was four or seven, according to the opinion of Daniel. From the fact that Enoch is, so to speak, in the direct line of apocalyptic descent from Daniel, and Tobit is not, and, moreover, as the angelology of Tobit is in close connection with the Persian hierarchy of <span class="accented">am-haspentas</span>, of which there were seven, - we may regard four as the more genuinely Jewish number. The later Jewish angel-elegy has many Persian elements, as shown by Dr. Kohut, in his 'Angelologie und Demonologie.' Whether the number of the archangels be made four or seven, both Gabriel and Michael are of the number, whereas Gabriel's words would rather indicate that, though Michael belonged to the rank of chief prince, he did not. As we cannot tell the nature of the opposition, we cannot tell the nature of the help afforded. <span class="accented">And I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> It is very difficult to interpret this if we retain the Massoretic reading. In the first place, the sense given to <span class="accented">nothartee</span> in the Authorized and Revised is unsuitable. The angel is explaining how, after having delayed three whole weeks, he has now come. The sentence, as interpreted above,would have explained why he could not come at all to Daniel. It is attempted to get over this by explaining that Gabriel had beaten off the "Prince" of Persia, and that Michael remained with the King of Persia instead of him. This view, however, contradicts the function assigned to angels of nations, and implies a quasi-omnipresence on the part of Gabriel, and would render his explanation no explanation. The explanation of Gesenius, Havernick, and yon Lengerke, that <span class="accented">nothartee</span> is to be taken as meaning "I received the pre-eminence," as Wirier, "superior discessi apud reges Persarum," has no justification in usage. Gescnius would bring in the Syriac use of the hithpael of this verb, but though both Castell and Brockehuann assign meanings suitable, none of their quotations represents a sense precisely similar to that assigned to the verb here Hitzig's interpretation, "I was delayed," fails to explain his coming. Ewald's explanation, "I was superfluous," is logical, but has no grammatical justification. Professor Bevan's explanation, which would take this last clause as parenthetical, is untenable, as it supplies no redden for the presence of Gabriel with Daniel. We must follow the LXX. and Theodotion in reading, either as Meinhold and Behrmann, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> or better, as Gratz, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, as the <span class="accented">vav </span>in the former ease would naturally be read conversively. Besides, Gratz's reading explains the needlessly emphatic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Further, it seems needful to accept the reading of the two Greek versions and the Peshitta, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d3;</span>. None of the old versions support the Massoretic; the Vulgate is the nearest; and all of them have either read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span> or regarded <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5d9;</span> as a form of the construct state, and so vocalized differently. Further, the later context here implies the contiuance of the conflict or controversy (vers. 20, 21). We must understand, then, that Gabriel left Michael to maintain the conflict against the angelic "Prince" of Persia, while he came in obedience to Daniel's prayer. We can have but little idea of what is meant by this conflict in the heavenlies between angelic beings.

"And there was no strength in me," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span>. Theodotion renders, "And behold, as the likeness of a son of man touched my lips, and I opened my mouth, and spake, and said to him that stood before me, In thy appearance my bowels (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) were turned in me, and I had no strength." Theodotion has evidently had the singular <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>, or perhaps regarded it as a survival of the old form of the construct. It is probably not due to a different reading, but to a different meaning given to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, that we have <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta resembles Theodotion very closely, having, however, <span class="accented">enosh</span>, "man," instead of "son of man." We have also go', "body," or "viscera," as the translation of <span class="accented">tzeereem.</span> The Vulgate renders to the same purport; the last portion of the verse runs thus: <span class="accented">In visions tua dissolutas sunt compages meae et nihil in me remansit virium.</span> It also has, in the first clause, <span class="accented">similitudo filii hominis.</span> It seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that we should read "son of man" instead of "sons of man" Were there any diplomatic or other evidence in favour of the reading of the LXX., it would be much preferable to any other, as we have the description of the visitant whose hand touched Daniel, in vers. 5 and 6. Hence the assertion here, that the likeness of a son of man touched him, does not harmonize with this, as it seems to introduce a new person. There is no reference to hands in the description in vers. 5 and 6, "the hand as of a man" there would not be the introduction of something already mentioned. <span class="accented">Touched my lips.</span> In the previous chapter, ver. 21, the angel Gabriel "touches" Daniel. The emphasis of the act, in the present instance, does not be in the fact of touching, but in this - that it was the lips that were touched. In <a href="../../par/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6</a> and 7 one of the seraphim touches the lips of the prophet with "<span class="accented">a</span> live coal from off the altar." In Isaiah the object is purification; in the case before us it is the restoration of the power of speech. <span class="accented">Then I opened my mouth</span>, <span class="accented">and spake</span>, <span class="accented">and said unto him that stood before</span> me. This is the result of the touch of the angelic hand. <span class="accented">O my lord</span>, <span class="accented">by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me</span>, <span class="accented">and I have retained no strength.</span> "Lord" here is not "Jehovah," but "Adonai" - a title of respect, certainly, but not necessarily of adoration. Theodotion and the Vulgate render "thy vision," understanding by that "thy appearance." The meaning is the same as that of the ordinary reading. Hence it is probably due to a desire to emphasize this rather than to any difference of reading. "My sorrows are turned upon me." This is a term that involves great difficulty. The term is used of the pangs of childbirth (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19</a>), and transferred to sorrows (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). And this is the sense in which it has generally been taken here; the more readily that in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/4-19.htm">1 Samuel 4:19</a> the same phrase is used as here But the sense does not seem very good; the appearance of the angel was not an occasion of sorrow, however much of awe there might be in it. The word has a number of meanings, which it is certainly difficult to bring into relationship with each other. Thus in <a href="../../par/proverbs/26-14.htm">Proverbs 26:14</a> it means a "hinge;" in <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-13.htm">Proverbs 25:13</a> it means "messenger," and this is the meaning it most frequently bears (<a href="../../par/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; <a href="../../par/obadiah/1-1.htm">Obadiah 1:1</a>). Neither of these meanings is at all suitable. In <a href="../../par/psalms/49-16.htm">Psalm 49:16</a> we have the word appearing in the K'thib, and translated "beauty;" hence it would be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">hodee</span>) of ver. 8. The LXX. is out of court. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate differ from each other, so that nothing is to be drawn from them. We would, then, take this phrase as equivalent to that in the eighth verse, "I have retained no strength." This fitly follows up what has been already stated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-17.htm">Daniel 10:17</a></div><div class="verse">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</span> The LXX. does not preserve the peculiar use of the demonstrative which we have here. Theodotion has it in the second case only; the Peshitta retains it; but the Vulgate omits it altogether. The rendering of <span class="accented">neshama</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in the Greek versions may be noted. Jerome  renders, <span class="accented">halitus.</span> The Aramaic influence is seen <span class="accented">in</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span>. (<span class="accented">hayeh</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> ('<span class="accented">ayeh</span>). "<span class="accented">How</span> can the servant," etc., exhibits respect and humility. <span class="accented">For as for</span> me, etc. This seems not to be part of Daniel's address to the angel, but a note which he has added to indicate his condition while he was speaking. <span class="accented">-Neither is there breath left in me.</span> There is no certainty whether this is to be taken in the physical or metaphysical sense; whether we should regard the prophet as declaring that awe deprived him of the power of breath, or he felt his consciousness so numbed as that he seemed to be without it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then there came again and touched me <i>one</i> like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.</span> The versions here call for no remark. The prophet still stood, but trembling and powerless, unable to comprehend fully the revelation; but now again the strengthening hand touches him. It cannot be regarded as a strain put upon the meaning here, if we see in this repeated presence of one in the form of man a symbol of Christ, who took upon him the form of a servant, and was found in fashion as a man. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-19.htm">Daniel 10:19</a></div><div class="verse">And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace <i>be</i> unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong.

And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> The LXX. has its ordinary translation of the phrase rendered, "man greatly beloved (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>)." They give three words for the repetition of the command, "be strong:" <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>, "<span class="accented">be in</span> good health;" <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "play the man;" <span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>, "be strong." In the last clause the third person is retained, "Let my lord speak, for <span class="accented">he</span> strengthened me" - a change made for symmetry. Theodotion is much closer to the Massoretic text, only he, too, varies the words in the command, and has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;</span>. The Peshitta, like Theodotion, varies the word in the command, In the last clause the verb is put in the passive, "and I was strengthened," For the command the Vulgate has, <span class="accented">confortare et esto robustus</span>; but the last clause is in strict agreement with the Massoretic. It is to be noted that the repetition of the imperative, united by <span class="accented">ray</span>, is unexampled; the various renderings in the versions point to this being felt a difficulty, but do not suggest any variations of reading. Not only is the strengthening touch given, but consoling words are added, "Be strong, yea, be strong." Daniel was called upon to put forth energy, to summon his forces mental and spiritual. He had received the strengthening touch, but his own volition must go along with the aid divinely afforded. It is the combination which we find in our Lord's life; without faith even the miraculous power of our Lord could not be put forth. As we have noted, there is some uncertainty as to the reading, but no change would alter the sense of the passage, "And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened." The words spoken called forth the power that was latent, and had been imparted to Daniel. <span class="accented">And said</span>, <span class="accented">Let my lord speak</span>, <span class="accented">for thou hast strengthened me.</span> Even to hold converse with angelic beings, entailed expenditure of vital energy. The overpowering sense of the spiritual has to be resisted, at least so far, in order that mental action may go on. Had strength not been imparted, the revelations bestowed would not have produced any permanent impression on the mind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-20.htm">Daniel 10:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of Grecia shall come.</span> The versions here are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. Theodetion, since he begins the speech of the angel with <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>, may have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hayn</span>), "if," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b2;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>), the sign of interrogation. The Peshitta has, "to make war," instead of "fight," indicating a beginning of hostilities, not a continuance of them. <span class="accented">Then said he</span>, <span class="accented">Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee?</span> This question appears to be abruptly put, and to be put without awaiting an answer. Probably the meaning would be better brought out by rendering, somewhat colloquially, "You know, don't you? After I have revealed the future to you, I must return." In considering this whole subject, we must beware of taking everything literally. We may not deduce, because of the statement here, that angels are under the limitations of time and space, or that there is actual warfare. We must regard the matter as, to a large extent, figurative. <span class="accented">And now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia.</span> Every one who studies history in a philosophic spirit must see that the progress of the race, the evolution of that ultimate ideal state - the kingdom of heaven among men  - is accomplished by successive steps, and over each step a nationality presides. This nationality represents the special moment of spiritual force necessary to secure the new step the race is required to take. While in the lower plane of history the nations themselves do these things; in the higher sphere it is their angels who are the actors. A nation has in it much of the characteristics of a living organism, and the angel of the nation is the life of that organism. <span class="accented">As</span> a finite being, the angel of any nation of necessity is imperfect; his  knowledge of the Divine plan only limited. His instrument - the nation committed to his charge - is yet more imperfect. Let an imperfect being, however holy, have a piece of work to do, that work must assume, to him, an exaggerated importance; let him be associated as patron with sentient beings, and his affections must go forth to these beings in a special way. He will resist any attempt to limit in any way the function of that race which is specially his, and will be apt to interpret too widely this function, and be loth to recognize that its time is past, or this or that region is beyond its province. If we regard Gabriel as an angel - not of Egypt, as Hitzig, but of the kingdom of heaven, and by this the angel of prophecy (Ewald) - then he must exercise a watchful care over the actions of each nationality, and therefore of its angel, lest the ultimate purpose of God be in any way hindered. The angel of Persia might regard the national semi-independence allowed to the Jews as hindering the evolution of the idea exhibited by the Persian race. The Persian rule allowed races a good deal of licence if tribute were paid. It was required to specialize its treatment of the Jews; to convey them back from Babylon to Palestine; to protect them in Palestine; to assist them to set up a <span class="accented">quasi-independence</span>. All this was contrary to the negative character of the Persian rule, in contradiction to its spirit, and therefore opposed by its angel, who represented this spirit. Michael, the special angel of the Jews, naturally came to assist Gabriel. What a conflict between angelic spirits may mean, what may be the weapons of their warfare, we know not; we do know that, though not carnal, they are mighty. <span class="accented">And when I am gone forth.</span> To this phrase several meanings have been attached. Havernick, Maurer, and Ewald take it as meaning "going forth to war." Ewald renders, "I will return to contend against the Prince of Persia; so, while I am going forth, the Prince of Javan will come." In this connection it is very doubtful whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">yatza</span>) can mean "going forth to battle." Motion to the field of battle is indicated by "return." <span class="accented">Yatza</span> simply means to <span class="accented">go from</span> a given place; the purpose may be indicated by some other word. Another view is that of Hitzig, Hofmann, and Bertheau, "to go out," not to, but from "a conflict." This meaning is possible; it would certainly need some determinant to fix this meaning on it, but this may be supplied from the preceding clause. This view, though suiting admirably with the otherwise untenable supposition that the "prince" speaking with Daniel is the angel of Egypt, does not suit with the view that Gabriel, the "prince" talking with Daniel, is the angel of prophecy, and therefore of the ideal kingdom. Keil would take the first meaning of <span class="accented">yatza</span>, and would paraphrase thus, "Now shall I return to resume and continue the war with the Prince of Persia; but while I thus go forth to war - while I continue the conflict, the prince of Javan shall come, and then there shall be a new conflict." <span class="accented">Yatza</span> never does mean "to continue a conflict;" it means to begin either a war, a battle, or a campaign. A great deal of the difficulty is due to maintaining that angels are under the time-relation of human beings. The matter is clearer if we take it as meaning simply that when Gabriel went out from the presence of Daniel, the "Prince of Grecia" would come. <span class="accented">Lo</span>, <span class="accented">the Prince of Grecia shall come.</span> This does not refer to Alexander the Great, or the overthrow of the Persian Empire, still less to the Seleucids and their persecutions. Before his Babylonian reign, Cyrus encountered the Greeks, and roused their opposition. The angel, then, of the Greek nation began to stir up his people. Then came the Ionian revolt, and the successive invasions of Greece, which compelled the Persians to leave the "holy people" alone. The angelic Prince of Grecia appears first as an instrument of the angel of prophecy, to limit the power of Persia. When, after prolonged conflicts, the empire of Persia gives place to that of Greece, the conflict of the people of God must be renewed in a fiercer form. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a></div><div class="verse">But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and <i>there is</i> none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span> The LXX. rendering is, "And in very truth (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) I will show thee the first things in the writing of truth: and there was no one helping with me against these, but Michael the angel." The Septuagint translator read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hara'sheem</span>), "the heads," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harashoom</span>), written with a inserted as <span class="accented">mater lectionis.</span> Theodotion is in accordance with our English Version. The Peshitta renders, "Yet will I show thee something noted in the writing of truth; and there was none in all these who helped me but Michael your prince." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic and the English. <span class="accented">But I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">abal</span>) is a strongly adversative conjunction. The use of it is explained by Kranichfeld and Zockler as due to the fears for the theocracy aroused by the thought that the Greek power was rising against Israel. If  the idea had been that Gabriel was called to hurry back to his post because of the threatened approach of the Prince of Grecia, then it might be defended; only even then either the fact of the necessity for speedy return to the Persian court would have been emphasized, or the fact that he is delaying to make known the contents of the writing of truth. It is, perhaps, better rendered by "nevertheless," as it is in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/19-3.htm">2 Chronicles 19:3</a>. We can see the force of this particle by turning to ver. 7, "I Daniel alone saw the vision, for the men that were with me saw not the vision, but (equivalent to 'nevertheless') a great quaking fell upon them." This clause, we see, then, has all the appearance of being intruded violently into the text; it interrupts the progress of thought, and does not suit the context. There is no indication that he, Gabriel, will have to hasten back to the court of Persia with such rapidity as would necessitate the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">abal</span>), "nevertheless." But even so, why revert in the next clause to the contents of ver. 20, without the slightest indication that the line of thought in the past clause was dropped as soon as taken up? The last clause of this verse reads much better in connection with ver. 20 than with ver. 21<span class="accented">a</span>. Behrmann transposes the clauses in this verse, so as to get over tiffs difficulty, and Professor M. Stuart puts the first clause in brackets. "The scripture of truth" is a phrase that might have been suggested by <a href="../../par/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, "In thy book were all my members written." It is in line with a great number of phrases in apocalyptic literature; thus Enoch 93:1, "And after that Enoch began to recount from the books;" the Book of Jubilees, 1:24; 4:31; 5:15, etc., "the tablets of the heavens." The idea was that all the events that were to happen in the world's history were record, d beforehand in the books or tablets of the heavens. It is from failing to notice this that the late Professor Fuller was led to say "the scripture of truth "is the title for the ensuing section. Against this view is the preposition "in;" it is in the scripture of truth, among other matters, that these things are noted which form the succeeding section. At the same time, the form the representation of the heavenly books, which note beforehand what was to happen, assumes here is simpler than that in Enoch or the Book of Jubilees. <span class="accented">And there is none that holdeth with me in these things</span>, <span class="accented">but Michael your</span> prince. As we have above said, this clause is closely connected with ver. 20. <span class="accented">In these things.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version "against these," in accordance with the majority of recent commentators, Ewald, Hitzig, Fuller, Zockler, Bevan, Stuart, Kranlohfeld Keil, Kliefoth, Behrmann, etc., and, among older commentators, Jephet-ibn-Ali; but none of the older versions have it. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta has the preposition; the Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">in his omnibus.</span> With these Calvin agrees, though Luther renders, <span class="accented">wider jene.</span> Certainly, the most common meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> in such a connection is "against." So, notwithstanding the weight of the versions, we feel constrained to translate, "against these persons," and not "in regard to these things." In the first place, "in" is a far less frequent meaning of the preposition, and next, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">aylayh</span>), "these," most naturally refers to the persons last named. Although "the Prince of Grecia" was to be the instrument of the overthrow of the power of Persia, it was to become oppressive afterwards, as had been revealed to Daniel in the vision of the ram and the he-goat. Gabriel, the angel of prophecy, the special guardian of God's great ideal kingdom of heaven, was assisted in his guardianship only by Michael, the angelic Prince of Israel. The fact that along the line of the development of Israel as a nation ran, so far at least, the Divine plan concerning the kingdom of heaven, made it natural that Michael should favour that which furthered the interests of the race that was more specially under his care. As we have already said, we cannot even guess at the nature of these angelic conflicts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/9.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 9"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 9" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/11.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 11"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 11" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/11.htm"><title>Daniel 11 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/11.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/11.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/11-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/10.htm" title="Daniel 10">&#9668;</a> Daniel 11 <a href="../daniel/12.htm" title="Daniel 12">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a></div><div class="verse">Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, <i>even</i> I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-45.</span> - THE KINGS OF THE NORTH AND THE KINGS OF THE SOUTH. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</span> The versions show signs of great disturbance having happened here. The rendering of the LXX. is, "In the first year of Cyrus the king, he told me to be strong and to play the man." Theodotion's rendering is yet briefer, "And I, in the first year of Cyrus, stood in strength and might." The Peshitta rendering, "In the first year of Darius the Mede (he) arose to confirm and strengthen me." The Vulgate is close to the Massoretic and the English versions, "I likewise, from the first year of Darius the Mede, was standing that he might be confirmed and strengthened." The Revised Version does not differ seriously from the Authorized, "And as for me, in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood up to confirm and strengthen him." The Septuagint must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">amar</span>), "he said," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">anee</span>), "I." When we have the Septuagint and Theodotion supporting each other against the Massoretic text, the evidence against the received text is strong. In this case both these versions have, as will be seen, not "Darius," but "Cyrus." The two names would have in the old Egyptian Hebrew script, a striking resemblance to each other; the fact that the last letter of both names is the same, and also the second letter, made the likeness considerable in any script; but  the first letter of "Darius" is certainly very like  the first letter of" Cyrus." The <span class="accented">vav</span> would possibly be omitted, then the first two letters of either name would resemble closely the first two letters of the  other, and the final letters are the same. Mistake, then, was easy. The first letter of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span> is the same, and the words would be liable to be read in accordance with that given to the proper name. Further, all the versions but the Vulgate make the speaker the recipient of the aid. Theodotion may be taken as doubtful The difference is slight, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5db;&#x5d3;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The Septuagint seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span>. The first two letters are thus the same, the <span class="accented">daleth</span> may have been an intrusion. Bevan and Behrmann would omit the date as spurious, and hold it to have been introduced because the previous four chapters begin each with a date. This reason, to have weight, must assume the division into chapters to be of ancient date, more ancient than the Septuagint Version. The fact that all the versions have it compels us to admit a date here, but, as we have said above, it is to be reckoned by the year, not of Darius, but of Cyrus. (<span class="accented">Also I</span>) <span class="accented">in the first year of Cyrus the king.</span> The first year of Cyrus was the year when he decided to set the Jews free, and permit them to return to their own land; but the first year in this case was reckoned from his assumption of the throne of Babylon. We saw reason to doubt whether the reference in the beginning of ch. 10. was to the Babylonian reign of Cyrus, or to his reign as King of the Persians. His first year as King of the Persians might be when he first began to turn his arms against Babylon. We do not know enough of the history of the first years of Cyrus's monarchy to know what critical events befell in that rear. <span class="accented">Stood to confirm and strengthen him</span> (<span class="accented">me</span>). According to the Massoretic text, the angel Gabriel stood to confirm either the archangel Michael or King Darius. Certainly, as Darius (Cyrus) is the nearer substantive, the grammatical preference would be to take it, as do Havernick, Hitzig, and Calvin. The majority of commentators who hold by the Massoretic text take "him" to refer to Michael - and much can be said for this. Although Darius (Cyrus) is the nearest substantive, yet he is not the subject of the main sentence, but merely denotes a time, therefore a previous substantive must be chosen. In the opening of Cyrus's career, the intimate connection his prosperity had with the prosperity of the people of Israel might well make Michael interested. As Cyrus had been prophesied of, he was under the rule of the angel of prophecy, hence Gabriel strengthened and confirmed the efforts of Michael. Certainly "strengthening" and "confirming" are strong terms to apply to the archangel Michael, yet we know so little of angelic natures and their limitations that the phrase may be quite natural. The meaning is not materially altered if we read, "He stood to strengthen and confirm me." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-2.htm">Daniel 11:2</a></div><div class="verse">And now will I shew thee the truth.

Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "And now I came to show thee the truth. Behold, three kings have risen, and the fourth shall be rich with great riches above all, and when he shall strengthen himself in his riches, he shall stir himself up against every king of the Greeks." Theodotion is very like this, only the last words of the verse are, "all the realms of the Greeks." The Peshitta is very like Theodotion, having "kingdoms" instead of "realm." The Vulgate is in nearly exact agreement with the Massoretic text. When we turn to the Massoretic text and compare it with the versions, we find that the LXX. must have read, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span>, as it has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion reads, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span>; the Peshitta, <span class="accented">ma</span>; the Vulgate, <span class="accented">cum</span>. This is the beginning of the revelation referred to in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a><span class="accented">a</span>. The doubtful authenticity of that clause throws a shadow on this verse. It is to be noted that we are no longer in the region of symbol, but of distinct narration. There may have been something in the nature of a vision, and that here we have, enlarged, an interpretation of it. The fourth king is certainly Xerxes. If we regard him as one of the three successors to Cyrus, then Cambyses and Darius Hystaspis are the other two. So Hitzig and Delitzsch. Keil would more naturally make the fourth not the fourth King of Persia, but the fourth successor of Cyrus. (For the Hebrew usage, see <a href="../../par/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>.) Professor Bevan, assuming in his superior way the ignorance of the writer before us, here determines that he drew "most of his information" from the Bible, and, as there are only four names of Persian kings given in Ezra and Nehemiah, that he, this careful student of Scripture, came to the conclusion that there were only four kings. In the first place, if this portion was written, as it not impossibly was, in the Maceabean period, the writer must have got his information of the invasion of Greece by Xerxes from classical sources; he could not fail to know of Cambyses and the pseudo-Smerdis. Further, scarcely even the most casual reader of Ezra could fail to distinguish between the Artaxerxes who before Darius Hystaspis hindered the work of the Jews, and the Artaxerxes after Darius who fostered it. We have followed Herodotus in calling the brother of Cambysos, whose  name the usurper assumed, "Smerdis;" but Ctesias calls him "Tanyoxarces;" Xenophon, "Tanaoxares;" and AEschylus, "Marries." We know that Artaxerxes was probably not a personal name, but rather a title, as was also <span class="accented">Aehsverosh</span> Xerxes. Some, as Behramnn, assume the fourth monarch here to be Darius Codomannus, but there seems no reason for this assump tion, save that critics are superior persons; and the writer, albeit many of them admit him to be inspired, would be more likely to be wrong in his facts than that their theories should be defective. As the writer here gives no names, it is certainly singular to assert that, though, if we take his Hebrew as grammatical, he gives a correct enumera tion of the Persian kings, he has defied Hebrew usage, and been wrong in his enumeration. <span class="accented">He shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</span> All the versions except the Vulgate imply a plural here- <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5bb;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>. This reading is preferable to the Massoretic, which would arise easily from the next verse. If we may take this as the true reading, then the diversities of the states in Greece is indicated in the way most natural to an Oriental.

The Hebrew implies that the king was a mighty warrior. All critics are agreed that here the reference is to Alexander the Great. This does not mean that Alexander immediately followed Xerxes, but that his expedition was the revenge for that of Xerxes. Alexander, in his answer to Darius Codomannus, justified his invasion of Persia by referring back to Xerxes' invasion of Greece. The two expeditions, that which Xerxes made into Greece, and that of Alexander into Persia, might be regarded as causally connected. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-4.htm">Daniel 11:4</a></div><div class="verse">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those</span>. The LXX. rendering is, "And when he is risen up, his kingdom shall be broken, and divided to the four winds of heaven; not according to his might, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: because his kingdom shall be taken away, and he shall teach these things to others." It is difficult to see what reading the LXX. translator had when he rendered, "his might," for no word meaning "might" is at all like <span class="accented">ahareetho</span>, "his posterity." In the last clause he must have read, not <span class="accented">milbad</span>, but <span class="accented">melamayd.</span> Theodotion resembles the Massoretic more closely; he renders, "But when his kingdom stood (shall stand), it shall be broken, and shall be scattered to the four winds of heaven; and to his latter end (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), nor according to his rule which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be rooted out, and (let) for others besides these." The Peshitta agrees generally with this, only that when in the English we have, "not to his posterity," it has, "not to his sword (<span class="accented">siphoh</span>)" The last clause is somewhat paraphrastic, "And his kingdom shall be rooted, and shall not be to others save these." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The description here given of the empire of Alexander the Great is strictly accurate; his empire did not go to his posterity, nor did any of his successors possess a dominion as extensive as his. <span class="accented">For others beside those.</span> This has been thought to refer to the successors of those who first divided the empire among them. It seems more natural to regard "those" as referring to the posterity of Alexander, as the nearest antecedent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a></div><div class="verse">And the king of the south shall be strong, and <i>one</i> of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion <i>shall be</i> a great dominion.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes: and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</span> The LXX. rendering differs from this," And he shall strengthen the kingdom of Egypt; and one of the rulers shall overcome him (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and rule; and his power shall be a great power." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in sense. The Peshitta agrees verbally with the Massoretic, but, as it omits the preposition rain, the meaning the translator attached to the verse is difficult to ascertain. The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The verse abruptly introduces the conflict between the Lagid and Seleucid princes. There is no indication in the preceding verses that the four winds of heaven are to be taken so rigidly as is implied by this verse. It is no answer to say that Egypt and Syria alone came into intimate relations with the Jews; it is not a question of fact, but a question of the necessities of composition. The appearance presented is that of a fragment existing separately, and inserted here. The intruded references to the truth which is to be shown have the took of being awkward attempts to prepare for the subjoined narrative. Whatever its origin, it is very difficult to explain to what it refers. The king of the south is certainly one of the Ptolemies, most probably Ptolemy Lagi. <span class="accented">And one of his princes shall be strong above him.</span> This is usually understood to mean Seleucus Nicator, who, when driven from Babylon, his original satrapy, by Anti-genus, took refuge with Ptolemy Lagi, and became a commander under him in his war against Antigonus. Ptolemy also gave him  the few troops with which, after the battle of Gaza, he recovered possession of Babylonia. He certainly became by far the most powerful of the successors of Alexander. Indeed, he may be said to have had all the dominions of Alexander save Egypt and Syria on the south, and Macedonia and Greece on the west; for he had overthrown Lysimachus, and absorbed his dominion. <span class="accented">His dominion shall be a great dominion</span> states accurately the extent of the dominions of Scleucus. Rosenmiiller would refer the prenominal suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span>, "his," to Alexander, and understand Ptolemy as the prince in question; but this is improbable. It is impossible not to observe the abrupt introduction of this prince. Gratz would suggest that a clause has dropped out here, which declared that one of his (Alexander's) princes stood up in the north. Had this any manuscript authority, it would be plausible. More, however, would seem to be wanting. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-6.htm">Daniel 11:6</a></div><div class="verse">And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in <i>these</i> times.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</span> The LXX. differs in a remarkable way from this, "And at the end of years he shall lead them, and the King of Egypt shall enter into the kingdom of the north to make covenants: but he shall not prevail, because his arm shall not establish strength (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;</span>); and his arm shall become stiff, and that of those accompanying him, and he shall remain for a season (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)." It is certainly difficult to see the reading from which this rendering came. It is noticeable that there is no reference to "the king's daughter of the south." History confirms the statement in the Massoretic text, but there is no expedition related in the history of Philadelphus undertaken against the kingdom of Syria. It is trite our records of the reign of Philadelphus are somewhat scanty. Theodotion is nearer the Massoretic text, though not quite in accordance with it, "And after his Jays they shall mingle with one another (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); and the daughter of the king of the south shall enter unto the king of the north to make treaties with him: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; and his seed shall not stand: and she shall be betrayed, and those that brought her, both the damsel and he that did violence to her." The last words are separated from this verse and conjoined to the following verse. The text behind this seems, in many ways, superior to the Massoretic. The Peshitta agrees in the opening clauses with the Massoretic; at the end of the verse the difference is considerable, "But power shall not be in her, from the fear which she feared: and she shall be betrayed, and her youths, and those accompanying her, and those supporting her in this time." The Vulgate agrees pretty closely with this. The reference here is generally understood to be to the affinity made by the Lagids with the Seleucids, when Berenice, the daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphns, married Antiochus II. (Theos), who repudiated his first wife, Laodike, in order to do so. The leap over a space of approximately sixty years is not so trying as Professor Fuller imagines; but the uncertainty as to the text is great, and the meaning of even the Massoretic is by no means fixed. Still, the agreement with the course of events is so marked according to the common interpretation, that one feels inclined to adopt it. After the death of her father Philadelphus, Antiochus Theos took back Laodike, who, in order to escape the risk of being again dismissed, unceremoniously poisoned her rival Berenice and her <span class="accented">son</span>, and then her husband Antiochus. Yet this transaction seems somewhat dubiously set forth in the Massoretic text. Theodotion is closer to facts, though it is possible that the text has been altered to suit what were known to be facts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-7.htm">Daniel 11:7</a></div><div class="verse">But out of a branch of her roots shall <i>one</i> stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail</span>. The version of the LXX. is very different here also, "And a plant shall arise out of his root against himself, and the king of the north shall come against his power in his might, and shall cause disturbance, and[ prevail." The Hebrew text would bear the translation here given of the last clause, save "cause disturbance." The nominative may be the "king of the north." History confirms the ordinary interpretation. Theodotion, as usual, is in closer agreement with the Massoretic. Yet even he differs considerably: he connects the last words of the preceding verse, "In those times, one shall arise out of the flower of her root of his preparation, and shall enter into the strongholds of the king of the north, and shall do in them (according to his will), and prevail." The Peshitta is somewhat like this, "And there spring from the stem of her seed against his place, and he shall come in might, and he shall come in strength against the king of the north, and he shall pass over against them, and prevail." The Vulgate rendering seems to have a relation to that just given, "And a plant shall stand from the seed of his roots, and he shall come with an army, and shall  enter into the province of the king of the north, and shall abuse them, and take possession." There must have been very different manuscript readings to explain these widely different renderings. The Massoretic text scarcely quite bears out the rendering of the Authorized Version. Yet it is difficult to make any other consistent sense. Certainly Euergetes, brother of the murdered Berenice, advanced into Syria, and overran the whole country, captured Seleucia, the port of Antioch, then mastered Antioch itself, and advanced even beyond the Tigris, while Seleucus retired behind the Taurus Mountains. The statements in the LXX. suit better a later period in history, when Physcon rebelled against his brother Philometor. Epiphanes invaded Egypt, nominally in the interest of Philometor, and laid siege to Alexandria. This, however, does not suit with the next verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a></div><div class="verse">And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, <i>and</i> with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue <i>more</i> years than the king of the north.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their</span> <span class="cmt_word">princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</span> The version of the LXX. is again very different from that of the Massoretic text, "And their gods, with them that moulded them, he shall subdue (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and their multitudes with the vessels of their desirable things, the silver and the gold, shall go into captivity in Egypt, and the year shall be to the king of the north." Theodotion. as so frequently is the case, takes a place intermediate between the Massoretic and the version of the LXX. His rendering is, "And their gods, with those that moulded them, all their desirable vessels of gold and silver, he shall carry with the captivity into Egypt, and he shall prevail over the king of the north." Both the Greek versions take <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">nesikhayhem</span>) as derived from <span class="accented">nasak</span>, "to pour out," hence "to mould," "to form a molten image," reading the word <span class="accented">noskeem.</span> The Syriac differs from both the Greek renderings and also from the Massoretic, "And even he shall terrify them, and their desirable vessels of silver and gold and the captives he shall carry down to Egypt, and twice (literally, 'one, two') shall rise against the king of the north." The Vulgate differs in meaning from all the preceding, but the text it is drawn from does not differ consonantly from that of the Massoretes, "And besides their gods. and their graven images, precious vessels too of silver and gold, he shall lead captive into Egypt, he shall prevail against the king of the north." The word <span class="accented">n'sikhayeem</span> is rendered, in the Revised Version, 'molten images' - a meaning given to the word by Furst, Gesenius, and Winer, with reference to this verse. The meaning assigned to the word in the Authorized is drawn from Rashi, and is in accordance with the usage of Ezekiel (Ezekiel 32:30). <span class="accented">And shall also carry caprices into Egypt their gods</span>, <span class="accented">with their princes.</span> As we have said, Ptolemy Euergetes conquered all Syria and Mesopotamia to beyond the Tigris. From this we learn he carried off immense booty, and among the articles taken were images of their gods. And not only the gods of Syria, but the images of the Egyptian gods, which had been carried into Syria from Egypt by Cambyses, nearly three centuries before. If this doubtful word, <span class="accented">nasakeem</span>, is taken to mean "images," it is difficult to see the reference of the prenominal suffix. Does it mean that the gods themselves, and the images of these gods, were taken? That is to say, does it mean that gods of the Syrians were taken, and also their images, as if the images and the gods were different? From this, notwithstanding the general consensus of interpreters, we feel ourselves necessitated to differ, and to make the word mean "princes," although there is no prominence, in the few accounts we have of this expedition, to any captives of such rank as to be called princes. <span class="accented">And with their precious vessels of silver and of gold.</span> This rendering, although retained in the Revised, is scarcely grammatically accurate, as the noun for "vessels" is already defined by the prenominal suffix. On the other hand, this word cannot readily be in apposition, as the article would be needed. Professor Bevan would make it "in silver and gold." We feel inclined to regard this as a somewhat irregular construction, as if a <span class="accented">ray</span> had dropped out before <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b6;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, "silver," though most of the versions regard these nouns as in the genitive after "vessels." <span class="accented">And he shall continue more years than the king of the north</span> It is a matter of fact that Euergetes survived Seleueus Callinicus, his sister's stepson, about four years. Hitzig and Ewald would render," He shall refrain for some years from attacking the king of the north." This rendering has the advantage that it escapes from the purely unimportant personal statement that Ptolemy should survive Callinicus. That the king of the north was allotted to regain the greater part of the dominions which had been wrested from him, without any counter effort on the part of Ptolemy, is more important. Keil objects to this that the emphatic position of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> is against this, and would support the rendering of the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ipse prevalebit adversus regem Aquilouis.</span> Both versions are so far grammatically defensible; yet both are a little strained: both are in accordance with history.

Theodotion renders, "And he shall enter into the kingdom of the king of the south, and return into his land." The Peshitta differs more, "The king of the south shall enter in strength, and turn to his own land." The Vulgate does not differ from the others. This verse, assuming the king of the south, Ptolemy Euergetes, to be the subject of the verb, merely completes the statements of the previous verse, and seems to describe the triumphant return of Euergetes into Egypt. If we take - which, however, is not so natural - the king of the north as the subject, then the reference may be to the unsuccessful attempts made by Seleucus Callinicus to invade Egypt. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-10.htm">Daniel 11:10</a></div><div class="verse">But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and <i>one</i> shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, <i>even</i> to his fortress.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress</span>. The version of the Septuagint differs from this, "And his son shall both be stirred up, and shall assemble (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) a great multitude, and, ravaging with it (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), he shall enter, and pass by and return." The K'thib here supports this to the extent at least that it has "his son," not "his sons;" but the verbs are plural. The last clause of this verse in the Massoretic text is transferred by the Septuagint to the next; Theodotion, while, as usual, more closely in agreement with the Massoretic text, is not quite identical with it, "And his <span class="accented">sons</span> shall assemble a multitude moderately numerous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>), and he that cometh and overfloweth shall come and shall pass by, and shall enter, and shall struggle hard (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), even to his fortress (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Peshitta and the Vulgate are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">But his sons shall be stirred up.</span> The natural inference is that it is the sons of the king of the south who thus are stirred up, but, historically, it can only refer to the sons of Seleucus Callinicus, who, one after the other, succeeded him on the throne: Seleucus Ceraunus, who died after a short reign of rather more than two years; and Antiochus III., Magnus. Certainly Seleucus did little in this conflict, although he undertook a campaign to Asia Minor, in the course of which he was assassinated. It may be that this campaign was intended as a preparation for a great campaign against Egypt. On the death of Ceraunus, he was succeeded by Aatiochtus Magnus. This prince was very warlike. He began to assail Syria, which was in the possession of Philopotor, but was interrupted by news of war in the far East. After a successful campaign in Media and Persia, he wrested first Seleucia from the hands of Ptolemy Philopator; and then proceeded on his invasion of Coele-Syria and Palestine. <span class="accented">And one shall certainly come</span>, <span class="accented">and overflow</span>, <span class="accented">and pass through.</span> This describes in a compendious way the campaigns of Antiochus Magnus. <span class="accented">And be stirred up</span>, <span class="accented">even to his fortress.</span> This is supposed to refer to the recovery of Seleucia. Some think that this rather states that he pierced nearly to Pelusium, the frontier fortress of Egypt.

Theodotion, like this, differs from the Massoretic by inserting, "the king of the north," without the pronoun, as do all the other versions. Ptolemy. usually slothful and lethargic, was at length roused, and placed an army of seventy-five thousand men in the field. Against this Antiochus opposed the slightly superior army of seventy-eight thousand The two armies engaged at Raphia, and Antiochus sustained a severe defeat, losing no less than ten thousand men. The multitude commanded by Antiochus was given into the hands of Ptolemy Pifilopator. This seems the only interpretation which is consistent with facts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-12.htm">Daniel 11:12</a></div><div class="verse"><i>And</i> when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down <i>many</i> ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened <i>by it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands; but he shall not be strengthened by it.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "And he shall take the levy (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall trouble many, and shall not be afraid." There seems to have been some difference of reading in the last clause, but it is not clear what. Theodotion renders the first clause as does the Septuagint; but the latter clause is more in accordance with the English version of the Massoretic text. The Peshitta from the same text differs in its interpretation, "And he shall destroy them mightily, and his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many, and shall not be strengthened." The Vulgate presents no occasion of remark. <span class="accented">And he shall cast  down many ten thousands.</span> This, most probably, refers to the complete victory at Raphia, where Antiochus was reported to have lost ten thousand men. There is thus a repetition here of what has already been narrated. <span class="accented">But he shall not be strengthened by it.</span> It is very noticeable that Ptolemy did not even attempt to strengthen his position by vigorously following up his victory.

The LXX. does not differ essentially from this, only <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> comes in unnecessarily by a blunder - the less to be understood, as there seems no word which can have occasioned the misreading, unless it is simply a blunder of hearing for <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>; but against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis has <span class="accented">medeenatha.</span> There is also the limitation of the period after which the king of the north will return to "one year" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>), "a period of a year." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic . The Peshitta is closer than either of the Greek versions, as neither of them attempts to give, "coming he shall come," which it does. The Vulgate is like Theodotion. The reference here is to the second expedition against Egypt, undertaken by Antiochus after the death of Philopator. After his victory at Raphia, Ptolemy resumed his life of self-indulgence. Antiochus endeavoured to build up his empire by curbing the Parthians; then, after an interval of fourteen years, he once more invaded the territories of the Egyptian monarch. This second invasion resulted in Antiochus gaining possession of all Palestine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-14.htm">Daniel 11:14</a></div><div class="verse">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall</span>. The versions here differ from this, which represents the Massoretic with fair accuracy. The LXX. renders, "And in those times thoughts (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) shall rise against the King of Egypt, and he shall build again that which has fallen down of thy people " - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">oobanah</span>), "and he shall build," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">oobenee</span>), "and sons of;" he has read also <span class="accented">peratzee</span>, "breaches," instead of <span class="accented">peritzee</span>, "robbers," - "and he shall raise himself up" - reading singular instead of plural  - "to fulfil the prophecy, and they shall stumble." This confusion indicates that the reading of the LXX. is mistaken. Theodotion is as much removed from the Massoretic as is the above, "And in those times many shall rise against the king of the south, and the sons of the plagues (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) of thy people shall be exalted to establish the vision, and they shall become weak." If there were any trace of uncertainty in the reading at this point, we might be tempted to read <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, written <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x397;&#x399;&#x39e;&#x3a4;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span> for <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x39f;&#x399;&#x39c;&#x3a9;&#x39d;</span>. The reading of Nestle (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) is no improvement. The Peshitta renders, "And many shall rise against the king of the north, and the sons of the perversity of thy people shall be raised up to fulfil the vision, and shall be cast down." The change from "king of the south" to "the king of the north" must be noted, probably simply the result of blunder. The Vulgate renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e6;&#x5d9;</span> <span class="accented">pre-varieatorum</span>, <span class="accented">And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south.</span> Ptolemy Epiphanes was not only exposed to the assault of the confederates Antiochus and Philip of Macedon; but there were intrigues and conspiracies in the palace. <span class="accented">Also</span> <span class="accented">the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the sons of the oppressors.</span> Commentators of all varieties have assumed that these are Jews. Hitzig maintains that they were the Jews that sided with Antiochus's rule ('Historical Exposition of Daniel'); that they were the separatists, those who had gone down to Egypt (Calvin; Behrmann, 'Die Stiirmische Jugend'); Keil, "violent men who break through Divine law." So Kranichfeld and Wordsworth. Stuart, "the violent of thy people;" Ewald, "young high-handed men." Fuller thinks the word <span class="accented">prizzeem</span> is used as "rulers." Griitz would render, "to establish the vision, to make the law to totter " - an attempt to get, by addition to the text, an explanation. The Hebrew text does not bear out this meaning. Gratz here implies <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">hazion</span>), "vision," to be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">torah</span>), "law;" but this is never the case.

The version of the LXX. is, "And the king of the north shall attack and turn his spears, and shall take the fortified city, and the arms of the King of Egypt shall stand with his rulers, and there shall not be strength in them to resist them." It is difficult to imagine what  Hebrew text was before the translator when he rendered, "turn his spears." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in the first portion, and with the LXX. in the latter. The Peshitta rendering is not unlike the Massoretic, "And the king of the north shall come and shall lay ambuscades, and shall conquer strong fastnesses; and the arms of the south shall not stand, because there is not in them might to stand; and his chosen people shall not stand, because there is not might in them to stand." The Vulgate, as usual, is closest to the Massoretic. The reference here is most probably to the capture of Sidon, into which Scopas, the general of Ptolemy, had thrown himself after his defeat at Paneas. Other strongholds and fortified cities were of necessity taken at the same time. <span class="accented">The arms of the south shall not withstand</span>, <span class="accented">neither his chosen people.</span> Ptolemy sent several successive armies to relieve Sidon, but was unable to compel Antiochus to give up the siege.

The rendering of the Septuagint is quite different, "And he who entereth in shall do to him according to his will, and there shall be none to resist before him, and he shall stand in the province in the place of his will, and all things shall be fulfilled in his hands." Some of the variations may be understood by a slightly different vocalization, but others resist this explanation. Theodotion renders in a way that suggests a text between that used by the Septuagint translator and the Massoretic, "And he who entereth in shall do to him according to his will, and there shall not be one that standeth before him, and he shall stand in the land of Sabei, and it shall be perfected (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) by his hand." The Peshitta has, "cometh against him," as in the Massoretic, "the glorious land" is put down directly as "the laud of Israel." The Vulgate renders exactly as our Authorized Version does. <span class="accented">But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will</span>, <span class="accented">and none shall stand before him..</span> This is a fair description of the advance of Antiochus the Great through Coele-Syria and Palestine. Fortress after fortress fell before his arms. <span class="accented">And he shall stand in the glorious land</span>; "the land of delight." Ewald would render, "land of the ornament." It is certainly the land of Judea. <span class="accented">Which by his hand shall be consumed.</span> This certainly contradicts history as we have it elsewhere. The Revised is little better, "And in his hand shall be destruction," which is the rendering of Behrmann, Keil, Hitzig, and Bevan. The rendering of von Lengcrke, Ewald, Stuart, and Fuller seems better to take <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kalah</span>) <span class="accented">as</span> meaning "completely." The answer to the historical objection that Antiochus did not destroy Palestine, is that this distinction refers to Egypt; but as little did he destroy Egypt.

Theodotion is like the Massoretic, "And he shall set (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) his face to enter with the strength of all his kingdom, and he shall make all things straight with him, and shall give him a daughter of the women to corrupt her, but she shall not continue on his side, neither be for him." The Peshitta renders, "And he shall set his face to enter with the force of all his kingdom, and all his people shall pass over, and the daughter of men shall be given to him to corrupt her, but she shall not stand, neither be for him." The Vulgate rendering is independent of the other versions, "And he shall set his face that he may come to lay hold of his whole kingdom, and he shall do right things with him, and he shall give to him the daughter of women that he may overturn it, but she shall not stand, neither be for him." The events portrayed here are well known. Antiochus collected all his forces with a view to the conquest of Egypt, then, alarmed by the progress of Rome and the overthrow of Philip of Macedon, he changed his plan. He now endeavoured to get Ptolemy to be his ally, and gave him his daughter Cleopatra to wife, with Coele-Syria as a dowry. His idea was that she would remain always on his side, would be his spy in the court of her husband, and would always lead the policy of Egypt in the lines he wished. His hopes were frustrated. She was not corrupted so as to be false to her husband. In proof of  this, when her father's armies were defeated by the Romans, she joined with her husband in sending congratulations to the Senate of Rome.

Professor Bevan would ingeniously supply some words to the Greek. With all it seems nearly impossible to explain the relation between the Massoretic text and that used by the Septuagint. Theodotion is much briefer, "He shall turn his face to the islands, and shall take many, and shall cause rulers to cease from their reproach; but his reproach shall return upon him." The Peshitta renders, "And he shall turn his face to the islands of the sea, and shall conquer many, and a ruler of reproach shall cause it to cease in regard to him, and his reproach shall return to him." The Vulgate is closely related to the Peshitta. We would render the last clause, with Behrmann, "Yea, his reproach will he repay to him." The events referred to are clear and obvious enough. Antiochus the Great took advantage of the disastrous defeat inflicted on Philip of Macedon by the Romans, to seize many of the islands of the archipelago. He not only took possession of all the Asiatic dominions of Philip, but crossed into Europe and seized Thrace. The Romans demanded that he should retire from all the former dominions of Philip. He refused, and war ensued, in which, after being driven out of Europe, he was totally defeated at Magnesia by Lucius Scipio, and compelled to surrender all his dominions west of the Taurus.

Justin relates thus the death of Antiochus: "Meanwhile in Syria King Antiochus, being loaded with heavy tribute after his defeat by the Romans, whether urged by want of money or impelled by avarice, flattering himself that, under the plea of necessity, he might with fair excuse commit sacrilege, assaulted with an armed force by night the temple of Jove (Bel) in Elymais But the attempt having been discovered, there was a concourse of the inhabitants, and he was slain with all his forces." The resemblance here between the fate of Antiochus the Great and that of his son Epiphanes is so striking as to throw suspicion on one or other of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-20.htm">Daniel 11:20</a></div><div class="verse">Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes <i>in</i> the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom; but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in</span> <span class="cmt_word">battle.</span> The rendering of the LXX. differs very much from this, "Then shall a plant arise out of his root to the restoration (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) of the kingdom, a man striking the glory of a king." It is impossible to find any connection between the opening clause of this and the corresponding clause in the Massoretic. Some of the other clauses contain echoes of the Massoretic, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> The first clause of ver. 21 in the LXX. really belongs to this verse, "In the last days he shall be broken, not in wrath nor in war," reading thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ('a<span class="accented">haroneem</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> ('a<span class="accented">hadeem</span>). Theodotion agrees in the first clause with the Septuagint, but is equally unintelligible, "There shall arise out of his root one removing a plant of the kingdom; on his preparation he shall act (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), the glory of the kingdom: yet in those days he shall be broken, and not openly (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) nor in war shall he stand." The Peshitta renders, "In his stead shall one stand up who shall cause a ruler to pass through even the glory of your kings; and in a few days he shall be destroyed, not in tumult, nor in battle." The Vulgate renders, "In his stead shall stand a vile person (<span class="accented">vilis-simus</span>), and unworthy of royal dignity; and in a few days he shall be broken, not in fury, nor in battle." Difficult as is the interpretation of the words, just as difficult is it to find out the reference. Seleucus Philopator, who succeeded Antiochus, might be called a "raiser of taxes," as he had to meet as best he could the heavy demands of the Roman treasury. The rendering of the Revised suits also, "causing the exactor to pass through the glory of the kingdom." The reference might be to Heliodorus, were there any probability that he ever made an expedition to rob the temple. Certainly the story in 2 Maccabees makes it doubtful. It is not likely that Palestine would be exempt from taxation. To a Jew resident in Palestine - the land the possession of which had been the occasion or' so many wars - it might well seem the glory of the Syrian kingdom. <span class="accented">But within few days he shall be destroyed.</span> It is difficult to understand how the writer could reckon the reign of Seleucus Philopator as only a few days. His reign  of twelve years was certainly much shorter than that of his father Antiochus, but longer than that of Epiphanes his brother, or of Seleucus III his uncle. The Greek versions do not give this clause. If we do not resort to the somewhat desperate remedy of altering the reading, we are compelled to measure the days from the taxing of Judaea. A good deal might be said for the reading of the LXX. <span class="accented">He shall be destroyed</span>, <span class="accented">neither in anger</span>, <span class="accented">nor in battle.</span> If we may assume as correct the unsupported account of Appian, that Seleucus IV. was assassinated by Heliodorus, we can see that he was destroyed "not in batlle." It conveys an idea of the facts of the case different from that given in Appian, when we say he was "not destroyed in anger." Moreover, the fact that Josephus refers to the death of Seleucus Philopator in terms that imply that be knew nothing of his violent death, makes his alleged assassination by Helio-dorus at least doubtful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a></div><div class="verse">And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries</span>. As said above, the opening clause of this verse, as it appears in the Septuagint, really belongs to the previous verse, "And there shall stand up in his place a mean person (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), and the glory of a king shall not be given to him, and he shall come suddenly, and the king shall be strong in his inheritance." Evidently the translator, has omitted the reduplication and has derived the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">halaqlaqqoth</span>) from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hel</span> <span class="accented">qah</span>), "a portion," "an inheritance." Theodotion's rendering is not very intelligible, "On his preparation he shall be set at naught, and they shall not give to him the glory of the kingdom, he shall come in prosperously (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>), and shall overpower the king dom by flatteries." It is, however, more in accordance with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is in practical agreement with the Massoretic, and the Vulgate reads as if a rendering of the Peshitta. It is assumed that this is Antiochus Epiphanes, yet there are considerable difficulties. A vile <span class="accented">person.</span> Certainly he was morally vile enough, though not nearly so vile as some of the kings of Egypt, his contemporaries, or some of his own ancestors. The meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is "rejected, despised" (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). It may be that it was derived from the idea that the Romans rejected Epiphanes as a hostage, and demanded Demetrius the son of Seleucus instead, and so Epiphanes got the opportunity of returning to Syria. This, however, is not the aspect which the matter assumes in Appian. Seleucus appears as the party desiring the change of hostage. <span class="accented">To whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom.</span> That certainly is not the case; he had the kingdom as much as his brother had; he was acknowledged as king. He certainly had not the power his father had before his defeat at Magnesia, but he had as much as the semi-subject conditions of Syria permitted. <span class="accented">He shall come in peaceably.</span> That also is doubtful, for Eumenes of Pergamos supported his claims with an army. <span class="accented">Obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</span> Even that is not a prominent feature of the accession of Antiochus. The Septuagint, as will be seen, separates between the vile person who should not have the glory of the kingdom given to him, and the king who should be strong in his inheritance. If we were sure that Appian had followed Polybius, we might see in the first part of the verse Heliodorus, and in the second the coming of Epiphanes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-22.htm">Daniel 11:22</a></div><div class="verse">And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is very wide of this, "And the broken arms he shall break from before him." Although this is much shorter than the Massoretic text, yet the contradictory assertion that arms already broken are broken before him is conclusive against accepting the evidence of the Septuagint absolutely. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, not with the English versinns, "And the arms of the overflowing shall be overflowed from before him, and be broken, even the leader of the covenant." The Peshitta is widely different, alike from the Massoretic text and that of the Septuagint, ";And their mighty ones of the city he shall carry away, and they shall be broken from before him, even the leader of the covenant." The Vulgate stands in a closer relation with the above than with the Massoretic text or the Greek versions, "The arms (<span class="accented">brachia</span>) of one fighting shall be driven out (<span class="accented">expugnabuntur</span>) from his face, and shall be broken besides, and (<span class="accented">insuper et</span>) the leader of the covenant." The reference here seems to be to the campaign'  - if there was a campaign - by which Epiphanes secured possession of the throne of Syria. <span class="accented">The prince of the covenant.</span> Who this can be it is impossible to say. The idea supported by Hitzig, Bevan, Behrmann, that Onias III. is referred to, is founded on the utterly unhistorical narrative in 2 Macc. 4. The view of Moses Stuart is that it is some sovereign who had a league of amity with Epiphanes. The reference thus might be to Eumenes or Attalus, who supported the claims of Anthochs. <span class="accented">Negeed bereeth</span> may be explanatory of the prenominal  suffix in <span class="accented">milpanayo</span>, "before <span class="accented">him."</span> As Stuart acutely remarks, had the reference in be<span class="accented">reeth</span> been to the Divine covenant with the Jews, we should have had <span class="accented">habbeereth.</span> 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-23.htm">Daniel 11:23</a></div><div class="verse">And after the league <i>made</i> with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "And with the covenant and a people set in array he shall fabricate a lie, even against a strong nation with (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>) a small people." The rendering of Theodotion is somewhat difficult to comprehend, "By reason of leagues against him, he shall make a device, and shall ascend and master them with few people." The Peshitta is very like Theodotion, only the last clause of this verse is regarded as the first of the next. The Vulgate is closer to the Massoretic than are any of the other ancient versions, "And after friendships with him, he shall work fraud, and shall go up and conquer with a small number." The reference here is to the obscure events which attended the contest - if there was a con-test - that resulted in Epiphanes securing the throne. The alliance may refer to his league with Eumenes. Appian assigns as a reason for the help given to Epiphanes by Eumenes, that it was to gain his friendship. Only Appian mentions "Attains and Eumenes," as if they were separate sovereigns; but Attains was brother of Eumenes, and, at the time of the arrival of Epiphanes, his brother's envoy at Rome. There may be some foundation of fact, and this would explain the statement in the text. The hopes of Eumenes, if he wished to strengthen himself by an alliance with Epiphanes, were probably soon frustrated, as Epiphanes involved himself in conflict with Egypt.

In the first clause, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> seems to have been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="accented">Medeena</span> is taken in its Syriac meaning. It is difficult to see what reading could produce both the Massoretic and the Septuagint renderings. Theodotion differs alike from this and from the Massoretic, "And in plenty, and in the fat places he shall corn and he shall do what his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; and he shall disperse among them captives (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>), and spoil and <span class="accented">possessions</span>, and against (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span>) Egypt he shall devise devices, even for a season." The Peshitta is like the Massoretic. It joins what is reckoned the last clause of ver. 23 to the present verse, and omits "peaceably;" the last words of this verse are transferred to the next. The Vulgate is more related to Theodotion than to the Massoretic text, "And he shall enter plenteous (<span class="accented">abundantes</span>) and rich <span class="accented">cities."</span> The remaining part of the verse agrees with the Massoretic text The events here indicated are somewhat difficult to identify. The histories of this period are scanty, and, with the exception of Polybius, whose work has come to us in a fragmentary condition, not very trustworthy. Moreover, the readings are uncertain in a portion of the verse. It is generally held to describe the first entrance of Epiphanes into Palestine or Egypt  -  more generally the latter  -  an opinion shared by Theodotion. The English versions do not bring out the probable meaning, although their rendering agrees with the Massoretic pointing, "That which his fathers have not done," etc. The repeated triumphant invasions of Egypt are probably referred to. <span class="accented">Forecast devices against the strong holds.</span> This may refer to the siege of Alexandria, which he was on the eve of commencing when he was compelled by the Roman envoy, Popilius Lena, to desist; but this is evidently the subject of the later verse. We can most easily understand this verse if we regard it as a summary of the whole reign of Antiochus. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him</span>. The versions present no point of remark, save that, instead of "king of the south," the Septuagint has, as usual, "the King of Egypt." This is supposed to be a compendious account of the second of the wars waged by Epipbanes against Egypt; but it suits the first better. At this time the Romans had declared war against Perseus, King of Macedon, and Antiochus, finding that they did not conquer Macedon easily, regarded the opportunity a suitable one for assailing Egypt and wresting from Ptolemy Philometor Coele-Syria, which his father had given as dower with Cleopatra, his daughter. The state of Egypt presented an aspect eminently hopeful to an assailant. The court of Egypt was full of intrigue and treachery; the centre of intrigue was the brother of the king, Ptolemy, nicknamed  Physeon. The king, Ptolemy, was young; his generals, however, took up the challenge, and set on the field a large army; but the army was defeated, and Antiochus advanced as far as Memphis. Ptolemy was taken prisoner by his uncle, and Physeon his brother ascended the throne. The defeat of Philometor was supposed to be largely due to treachery.

Theodotion is liker the Massoretic , "And they eat his provisions, and shall break him to pieces; and he shall overflow powers, and many shall fall wounded." The account of the invasion of Egypt by Epiphanes occurs in 1 Macc. 1:18. The Septuagint translator, appears to have read, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veochlay path-bago</span>), <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">veachloo dageothav</span>). There would seem also to have been some confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">heel</span>), "strength," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">halach</span>), "to go." The Peshitta rendering is, "They that eat his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall be dispersed, and many shall fall wounded." The Vulgate is closely related to this. This refers to the treachery which was alleged to have been at work and to have caused the overthrow of Philometor in his contest with his uncle. The version of the Septuagint is more picturesque, and more in accordance with facts. Cares might well devour Ptolemy Philometor -  treachery in his army and his brother occupying his throne. Certainly he was defeated, turned asae, and was compelled to accompany the victor as a prisoner, while Egypt was wasted (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>)

Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic, agreeing in this with the Peshitta and Vulgate. The probable reference is to Ptolemy Philometor, conveyed practically a prisoner with his uncle's army, while Epiphanes carried on his invasion of Egypt. They dined at one table, and probably deceived each the other. The purpose of Ptolemy was to get his usurping brother Physcon dethroned; the object of Antiochus was to <span class="accented">possess</span> Egypt for himself. Rashi sees in this a reference to the quarrels and reconciliations which diversified the conflict between John Hyrcanus II. and his brother Aristobulns. Jephet-ibn-Alimakes the two kings mean Arabia and Rome, since, according to him, these are respectively the kings of the south and of the north. <span class="accented">Yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</span> The progress of Antiochus was interrupted by the Romans.

The Peshitta differs only by omitting the last clause, which certainly seems a redundance. On his return from his Egyptian campaign, Epiphanes, we learn from 1 Macc. 1:20-23, plundered the temple of all its treasures. On the somewhat suspicious authority of 2 Macc. 4. some have referred to the report spread that Antiochus was dead, and that, taking advantage of this, Jason seized the city and drove Menelaus into the citadel; and that, bearing of this uproar, Antiochus, imagining that Judaea had revolted, retired from Egypt, and wreaked vengeance on Jerusalem, taking it by assault. The slaughter inflicted is confirmed by other authorities; but the resistance implied in the assertion that he took the city by force of arms (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) is contradicted by Josephus and 1 Maccabees.

Theodotion is also in practical agreement with the Massoretie text. The Peshitta is much shorter, and differs very much from the above, as well as from all the other versions, "And he shall do in the former and in the latter." There seems to have been something omitted, The Vulgate gives a different rendering of the last clause, "The last shall not be like the former." The reference is to the second expedition of Antiochus into Egypt. His two nephews, whose quarrels and rivalries he had hoped to utilize for his own pur<span class="accented">poses</span>, were now to appearance reconciled;  they agreed to a joint occupation of the throne.

And he shall do and return, and have understanding against those who have been left to the holy covenant." The Peshitta renders more in harmony with the Massoretic text, "Those who come against them from the lines of Chittim, even they shall break him, and he shall turn and be enraged against the holy covenant, and shall have understanding with them that forsake the holy covenant." The rendering of the Vulgate is singular, "And there shall come against him trieres (ships of war, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) and Romans, and he shall be, beaten, and shall return, and shall be enraged against the testament (<span class="accented">testamentum</span>, covenant) of the holy place and shall do, he shall even return and shall devise against those who have left the testament (<span class="accented">testamebtum</span>) of the holy place." The ships of Chittim are the Roman ships, bearing the envoys of the Senate with C. Popilius Laenas at their head. He delivered to Anti,bus the tablets on which were inscribed the wishes of the Senate. Antiochus was then on the eve of commencing the siege of Alexandria, and completing the conquest of Egypt. Having read that the Senate of Rome desired him to refrain from attacking the allies of the Republic, Antiochus said he would answer after con-suiting with his friends. Lsenas drew a circle round him with his staff on the sand, and demanded that he should give his answer before he left the circle. Antiochus had to submit. <span class="accented">Shall have indignation against the holy covenant.</span> It is not certain whether Antiochus was present personally at the plunder of Jerusalem or superintended the massacre of the Jews; but it is practically certain that at this time began the systematic attempt to put down Judaism. <span class="accented">And have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</span> It is not improbable that Antiochus was encouraged to make the attempt he did, by the fact that so many persons high in position were Hellenizers (1 Macc. 1:11-15, in which there is reference to those that forsook the holy covenant). The desire of Antiochus was probably to make his empire more homogeneous. The Jews, he would see by the fact that they had a national unity apart from his empire, might at times be thorns in his side - might become allies of Rome if he were compelled to engage in war with the Republic. It was their religion that was the bond which united the nation; let that be broken, then there would be a chance of the Jews blending harmoniously with the other races that made up the Syrian Empire. Those that forsook the holy covenant made him think it an easy task.

The Peshitta is quite different in the firs; clause, "And their strong ones shall arise from them, and they pollute the sanctuary of strength, and they cause the sacrifice (<span class="accented">qorban</span>) <span class="accented">to</span> pass away, and they shall hang up the abomination in the temple." The Vulgate rendering is in accordance generally with the Massoretic, "And arms shall stand from him. and shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall remove the continual (<span class="accented">juge</span>) sacrifice, and shall place the abomination of desolation." <span class="accented">Arms shall stand on his part.</span> This word "arms" here is not to be understood as weapons - a misunderstanding possible in English. "Arms" here stands as the symbol of physical power generally. "On his part" is represented by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, which means "with" or "from;" hence we find the Septuagint translating by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>,  and Theodotion by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span>. Probably the most natural view is to take the preposition as equivalent to "by," that is, he shall set physical forces in motion. <span class="accented">And they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength.</span> That the temple in Jerusalem had all the characteristics that fitted it to become a fortress, was proved in every one of the numerous sieges it has endured. It becomes still more a fortress, of course, when the Tower Antonia was erected overlooking the temple area. There may, however, have been a reference to the fact that the collectors of tribute sent by Antiochus fortified the city of David, and used it as a basis of operations from which to assail the temple and defile its courts with blood (1 Macc. 1:35-36). <span class="accented">And take away the daily sacrifice.</span> The Hebrew word here used means "continual," and the substantive "sacrifice" is supplied. In ver. 45 of the same chapter of 1 Macc. we are told that Antiochus forbade "burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and drink offerings in the temple." <span class="accented">And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</span> One must note here the source of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> which we find in both Greek versions, and <span class="accented">dabit</span>, which we find in the Vulgate. The Hebrew has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">venath'noo</span>), "and they shall <span class="accented">give</span> or set." It seems to refer to an altar to Jupiter, which was erected on the brazen altar (1 Macc. 1:59). This altar is spoken of in ver. 54 as the "abomination of desolation (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The Hebrew phrase has been borrowed from <a href="../../par/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; hence the suggestion of Professor Bevan, to read here "<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, is not necessary

Theodotion does not require special notice, as his version here agrees closely with the Massoretic. The Peshitta is somewhat shorter and having a different significance, "And those who transgress against the covenant he shall condemn them. And the people who know the fear shall be strong." The Vulgate rendering is, "And the impious against the covenant shall feign falsely (<span class="accented">simulabunt fraudu-lenter</span>), but the people knowing their God shall possess and do (exploits)." Men like Alcimus, the high priest after Menelaus, were transgressors of the sacred covenant, and were corrupted by the flatteries of Epiphanes.

While we would not be held as regarding as literally historical the sufferings of Eleazar and the seven brethren and their mother, as related in 2 Marc. 6. and 7, and more fully in 4 Maccabees, yet it can only have been an exaggeration of what must have actually occurred.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>some</i> of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make <i>them</i> white, <i>even</i> to the time of the end: because <i>it is</i> yet for a time appointed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end; because it is yet for a time appointed</span>. The rendering of the LXX. is, "And some of those of understanding shall consider to purify themselves beth to be chosen and to be purified to the time of the end, for the season is for hours." The translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. The reading of the Massoretes is to be preferred. Theodotion's, while closer to the Massoretic text,' is not identical with the sense as represented by the Authorized and Revised Versions, "And some of those of understanding shall be weak to try them, that they may be chosen out and revealed at the end of time, for it yet is for a season." Both Greek versions, as will be seen, render <span class="accented">barar</span>, "choose" - a meaning it has in the pual - and both omit one of the clauses. In this the Greek versions have the support of the Peshitta, which renders, "And (some) of the wise shall be overthrown to choose among them, and that they may understand to the end, because it is again protracted for a season." Here, too, the last of the clauses descriptive of the effect of the fall of the wise is omitted. Although the Vulgate supports the Massoretic in this, we feel it suspicious. <span class="accented">And some of them of understanding shall fall.</span> Though marvellously successful, yet Judas and his comrades suffered some reverses; the reference may be to those that fell in battle. The rendering in Theodotion would seem to point to some apostatizing. We have no record of any such cases, yet it is not impossible that some would fall away. This would be a greater trial than defeat and the death in battle of such heroes as Eleazar, surnamed Avaran, or even of Judas Maccabaeus himself. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">try them</span>, <span class="accented">and to purge</span>, <span class="accented">and to make them white.</span> The death of teachers and of military leaders would be a severe test of the zeal and enthusiasm of the faithful. All the fearful and insincere would fall off from the ranks of the faithful. Those zealous for the Law of God would be at once tried and purified by these untoward events. This has been the experience of the Christian Church in every age. Because more a trial, therefore more purifying would be the failure of some to maintain the faith under trial. <span class="accented">Even to the time of the end</span>: <span class="accented">because it is yet for a time appointed.</span> It is in perfect accordance with the view that the purpose of the death of teachers and leaders, even their failure, is the purification of the saints, that the time of the trial should be fixed and definite. This view is frequent in the Apocalypse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-36.htm">Daniel 11:36</a></div><div class="verse">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished; for that that is determined shall be done</span>. The LXX. does not differ greatly from this, "And the king shall do according to his will, and shall be enraged, and be exalted above every god, and against the God of gods shall he speak marvellous things (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>) and shall prosper until the wrath be accomplished; for on him (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) there is an end." The difference in the last clause is considerable between the LXX, and not easily explicable. Theodotion differs somewhat more, "And he shall do according to his will; and the king shall be exalted, and be magnified, and he shall speak marvellous things, and he shall prosper until the wrath is ended; for it is to a determined end (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Peshitta is closely related to the Massoretic, even in the last clause, where a difference is manifested in the others. The Vulgate affords no occasion of remark. The question that has to be settled here is - Who is the king who shall do according to his pleasure? Aben Ezra maintained the reference  was to Constantine the Great. Rashi, followed by Calvin, would make it the Roman Empire personified. He notices the Rabbins' referring this to Titus and Vespasian. As above mentioned, his own view is that the 'Monarchia Romana' is here intended. Jephet-ibn-Ali sees in this a prophecy of Mohammed; others, Wordsworth and Rule, following Jerome and Luther, think the reference here is to the antichrist of the New Testament. For our own part, we see no necessity for supposing any other monarch than Epiphanes is referred to. While Livy and Polybius remark on the piety of Epiphanes, it may seem strange to refer what is said here to him; but his ruthless plundering of temples proved that his piety was merely a political expedient. <span class="accented">Speak marvellous things against the God of gods.</span> We have no record of any proclamations of Antiochus which exactly suit this; but then we must bear in mind that we have only compendious accounts of what he did proclaim. To the heathen, moreover, as to Polybius and Livy, words of contempt against Jehovah would seem nothing worse than impolitic; but to the Jew, blasphemous words would be so horrible that they would not be recorded, as being a contamination: hence it is not extraordinary that we hear nothing of blasphemy in the history of Antiochus. The forbidding of sacrifices and of circumcision, while clearly enough dishonouring to God and to the Jewish nation, do not contain enough to justify the statement. <span class="accented">Shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished.</span> If by the indignation (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">za'am</span>) is meant the sufferings endured by the Jewish people, then the prosperity of Epiphanes - his life, indeed - did not last so long as the sufferings inflicted on the Jews; for these continued for some time after his death. There is probably here an indication that the writer's horizon did not reach to the death of Antiochus. Certain, by his faith in God, that Antiochus would perish, he thinks that until that time he may prosper. <span class="accented">For that that is determined shall be do</span>,<span class="accented">to.</span> There is considerable difficulty as to the text here, but all the various forms convey the same meaning - a definite limit to oppression. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-37.htm">Daniel 11:37</a></div><div class="verse">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all</span>. The Septuagint rendering is, "And to the gods of his fathers he will not have respect, and to the desire of women he will not have respect, because in everything he shall be exalted, and by him strong nations shall be subdued." The last clause belongs really to the next verse, of the first clause of which it is a variant reading. Theodotion is nearly identical in sense with this, "And no god of his fathers will he regard (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) and a desire of women." "This clause stands thus incomplete, as if the translator would have finished it with (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) "to him" - "he regards no god, because over all he is exalted." The Peshitta rendering is, "And to the god of his fathers he shall not have regard; nor to the desire of women, nor any god, will he have respect; but over all he shall exalt himself." It is to be noted that the Peshitta renders as does the English Version, and has the singular, "the <span class="accented">God</span> of his fathers," not as the Greek versions, "the gods of his." The Hebrew might be either. The Vulgate agrees here with the Syriac. <span class="accented">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers.</span> Antiochus is looked upon, not as a man of Macedonian or Greek descent, but as a Syrian, and certainly he had no reverence for the ancient gods of Syria. His opposition to the theocracy and to the worship of Jehovah was but a portion of a wide policy, the object of which was the abolition of all local cults. <span class="accented">The desire of women.</span> It might mean that he was not lustful; but there is no evidence that, like Charles XII., he was abstinent. On the ether hand, he never neglected war for luxury, as did some of the Hellenic kings. Moreover, it is almost imperative that it be an object of worship that is here referred to. Taking "the desire of women" as an object of worship, there is an interpretation which has come down to us from Ephrem Syrus and Jerome, that Beltis or Nanaea is here referred to; and the fact that in an attempt to plunder the temple of this goddess, in Elymais, Antiochus lost his life, supports this view. The worship is said to have been very lascivious. On the other hand, it was a worship that would not naturally be prominent to a Palestinian Jew. The suggestion of Ewald, that it was the worship of Adonis or Tammuz which Antiochus despised, is more likely to be meant here. <span class="accented">For he shall magnify himself above all.</span> Claiming the right of annulling worship, and taking the sacred utensils from the temple treasures, he allowed himself to be addressed by the Samaritans as a god. Antiochus was probably utterly without faith in the Divine; worship was merely policy.

There is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> in the Massoretic, where <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> has been in the reading followed by the Septuagint.

It is possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d3;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">nadad</span>)," to flee or move," was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">kabad</span>)," to honour;" for though <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span> is usually active and transitive, there is no object here. Theodotion has, "And the God of Maozeim he shall honour in his place, and a god whom his father knew not he shall honour with gold, silver, and precious stones, and with offerings." The Peshitta rendering is freer, "The mighty god he shall honour in his possession, and a god whom his fathers have not known shall he honour with gold and with silver, with precious gems and desirable things." The Vulgate adopts the transliteration <span class="accented">Maozim. In his estate shall he honour the god of forces.</span> There are a number of questions here. To whom does the prenominal suffix refer? The English translators have arranged the words so that we cannot escape the view that "the estate" is the king's, but the natural meaning of the Hebrew order is that it is "on the place" or "pedestal" of the god. The word translated "estate" is used in <a href="../../par/genesis/40-13.htm">Genesis 40:13</a> for "office." It is used of the "base" of the "laver." It may mean "place." The next point - What Deity is meant by "the god of strong holds"? There is absolutely nothing to guide us in the matter. Some have supposed that the reference is to Jupiter Olympius, whose statue Antiochus is reported to have set np in the temple. Others, that the reference is to Jupiter Capitolinus. Were there any evidences that Antiochus worshipped the genius of Rome, something might be urged for this; but we have no evidence of this. In the absence of anything to fix a definite meaning on this word, we feel inclined to suggest that Jehovah is meant by the <span class="accented">slosh mauzzeem.</span> Repeatedly in the Psalms is God declared to be the Strength of the saint; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/43-2.htm">Psalm 43:2</a> Of Jehovah it might be said that the ancestors of Antiochus - Greek and Syrian - knew him not. <span class="accented">Honour with gold</span>, etc. The repeated defeats of the armies of Antiochus and the spoiling of their camps by the followers of Jehovah, was giving honour to Jehovah, however unwittingly and unwillingly it was done. God "gat him honour upon Pharaoh," and so now he was honoured upon Epiphanes. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-39.htm">Daniel 11:39</a></div><div class="verse">Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge <i>and</i> increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory; and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</span> The version of the LXX. is somewhat difficult to render intelligibly, "By desires of cities he shall act, and to a strong fortress shall he come with a strange god whom he will acknowledge; he will increase his glory, and shall master him much, and shall divide his territory freely." The first words of this belong to the previous verse, and at the same time there has been some confusion with the opening words of the present verse according to the Massoretic division. Theodotion is not much closer to the received text, "And he shall act in strongholds of refuge with a strange god, and shall increase glory, and subject many to them, and shall divide the land in gifts." The sense of this last, as given in the Greek versions, is illustrated by <a href="../../par/psalms/16-4.htm">Psalm 16:4</a>. The Peshitta renders, "He shall pass over to the strong cities, on account of ('<span class="accented">al</span>) the strange gods which he shall see, and he shall rule over many, and the land he shall divide for gain" The Vulgate renders more in accordance with Theodotion than with the Massoretic yet independently, "And he shall do (<span class="accented">faciet</span>) that he may fortify <span class="accented">Maozim</span> with a foreign god, whom he knew not, and shall multiply glory, and shall give to them power in many (things), and shall divide the land gratuitously" This verse as it stands is nearly unintelligible. The suggestion of Hitzig and yon Lengerke, followed by Bevan, that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> ('am), "people," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">eem</span>), "with," is very plausible. The only objection is that none of the versions have it. As, however, it seems to us the only way out of the difficulty, we shall take this reading, and render, with Professor Bevan, "He shall procure for the strong fortresses the people of a strange god." For this use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d4;</span> Professor Bevan refers to <a href="../../par/2_samuel/15-1.htm">2 Samuel 15:1</a>, "Absalom procured for himself chariot and horses;" <a href="../../par/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>, so of Adonijah. <span class="accented">Whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory.</span> This we should render, "who have acknowledged him," making the antecedent to the relative, not the king, but "the people of the strange god;" the reference being to the mercenaries of the Syrian army, who were the people of a god strange to the Israelites, and not impossibly made less difficulty in giving up their national gods, and recognizing the gods of Greece as their gods. The K'thib here is the preterite instead of the imperfect, which occurs in the following clause, the reading which we accept here. <span class="accented">He shall increase with glory</span>; or rather, <span class="accented">he shall multiply in glory.</span> These mercenaries of his he would increase, and give ever more honour to them. <span class="accented">And he shall cause them to rule over many</span>. These mercenaries placed in fenced cities were formed into Hellenic communities, and received many of the natives as subjects. The reference is not merely to garrisons being placed in fortresses, but to a chain of Hellenic cities, which, in imitation of the Romans, Antiochus placed in Palestine. <span class="accented">And shall divide the land for gain.</span> As will be seen, the Greek versions and the Vulgate reverse the idea here, and render - the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">gratuitously</span>;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, "in gifts;" the Vulgate, <span class="accented">gratuito</span>, which is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">meheer</span>). The word may mean, as it is taken by the English versions and the Peshitta to mean, "for a price;" as in <a href="../../par/2_samuel/24-24.htm">2 Samuel 24:24</a>, David purchased the threshing-floor of Araunah <span class="accented">bimeheer</span>, "<span class="accented">at</span> a price;" but it also means "<span class="accented">wages</span>," as in <a href="../../par/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, "Her priests teach for hire wages (<span class="accented">bimeheer</span>)." The reference, then, is to the fact that in the deplenished state of his treasury, Antiochus divided the land of Palestine to his mercenaries, in lieu of the wages he could not pay. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-40.htm">Daniel 11:40</a></div><div class="verse">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over</span>. The Septuagint Version is somewhat shorter, "And at the time of the end the King of Egypt shall push at him: and the king of the north shall be enraged at him, with chariots and many horses and many ships, and shall enter into the land of Egypt." Probably the Massoretic has been amplified. Still it is a possible thing that, as Egypt was the natural objective of all the military preparations of Syria, the shorter summary might be inserted instead of the longer paraphrase of the Massoretic. Throughout in the Septuagint Version, as may be noted, "Egypt" stands in place of "the south." Theodotion is much closer to the Massoretic, but omits "the whirlwind," and has. instead of "countries," <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;</span>, "the land." The Peshitta differs in some respects more from the Massoretic than either of the Greek texts, "And at the end of time the king of the south shall strive with him: and the king of the north shall be moved against him, with chariots and horsemen and with many ships; and he shall act impiously in the land." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">At the time of the end.</span> This refers to the same "time of the end" as that in ver. 35; that is to say, not the end of the world, but the end of this distress. It is possible that to the writer the entrance of the new era - the Messianic time - would coincide with the fall of Antiochus, and that this era might be regarded as the end of the world. <span class="accented">The king of the south shall push at him.</span> This suggests war begun by the King of Egypt against Syria. It is difficult to see how this could take place after the fourth expedition of Antiochus into Egypt. The two brothers, Philometor and Euergetes (Physcon), were at war with each other shortly after this, and though Philometor gained the mastery, he was not in a position to threaten Syria. Certainly, had Ptolemy Philometor been in a position to take vengeance on his uncle, the successful rebellion of the Jews afforded an opportunity. We have no record in Polybius, Livy, 1 Maccabees, or Josephus of any expedition of Egypt against Epiphanes, either planned or attempted. Polybius is certainly fragmentary, and so to a greater extent is Livy; yet what has come down bears on events so near chronologically to this alleged expedition planned against Syria that it would scarcely fail to be noticed. <span class="accented">And the king of the north shall dome against him like a whirlwind</span>, <span class="accented">with chariot</span>, <span class="accented">and with horsemen</span>, <span class="accented">and with many ships.</span> This purports to be an account of an expedition undertaken by Epiphanes against Ptolemy, presumably Philometor. Of this there is not a trace; Antiochus is in so great need of money that he must use one half his army to collect money by robbing temples in Elymais, while the other, under Lysias, is occupied in attempting to put down the rebellion of the Jews. Again the historians of the period are silent, and what they tell us is inconsistent with this fifth expedition. Jerome, in his commentary on Daniel, quotes Porphyry, who gives an account of an expedition against Egypt in the eleventh year of his reign. That, however, was the year of his death - the year, therefore, of his expedition against Elymais. It is impossible that in the beginning of that year he should undertake such an expedition into Egypt as that described by Porphyry, and at the end have time to march into Elymais. It cannot be the expedition of Lysias which is referred to, for he is represented (1 Macc. 3:32) as having the oversight of all the territory of the king from the river Euphrates, but there is no notice of ships <span class="accented">And he shall enter into the countries</span>, <span class="accented">and shall overflow and pass over.</span> This might refer to the expedition which Antiochus undertook to Elymais, but in the following verse we learn the direction was toward Egypt. No such expedition occurred after the fourth. What explanation is to be given of this? The  explanation favoured by Keil of this whole chapter, that the king of the north is antichrist, is applied here; but so much of the earlier portion of this chapter can be interpreted as history, that we, for our part, are loth to give an eschatological interpretation to this. The view favoured by most is that here the author narrated his expectations, but these expectations were contrary to facts. This is Professor Bevan's view. If this view had been correct, the expectations of the author would be falsified almost as soon as they were recorded; this would certainly seem to render it impossible for the book to get the vogue it did. We, for our part, favour a modification of the view maintained by Hitzig, that this section is a repetition of what has been previously mentioned. Against this is the chronological statement at the beginning. Regarding, as we do, this chapter as an interpolation and the work of a later hand, our idea is that the section before us is one attempt to interpolate, and the preceding section is another, and that both have been incorporated in the narrative.

It is possible that the word <span class="accented">tzebee</span> was omitted, and the pronominal suffix attached to '<span class="accented">aretz.</span> Theodotion renders, "And he shall enter into the land of the Sabaeem, and many shall be made weak; but these shall be delivered out of his hand, Edom, and Moab, and chief of the sons of Ammon." The transliteration here might suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, and a mistake of the former for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> is in the square letters not impossible; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> are, in the older scripts, very unlike. The Peshitta, while agreeing with the Massoretic  generally, renders, "the glorious land," "the land of Israel" - an evident paraphrase. The Vulgate introduces <span class="accented">solae</span> before Edom and Moab, otherwise agreeing with the received text. The expedition of Antiochus reaches Palestine, on which the full force of the tempest is represented as being directed. The countries adjacent escape. Edom, Moab, and Ammon are mentioned, but Moab had by this time disappeared as a national name. It may have been inserted - as suggested by Professor Bevan - in consequence of the frequent conjunction of the three names, "Moab, Am-men, and Mount Seir." It is, however, singular that these nations should be named as "escaping," since they were the allies of Antiochus, or more properly, as they would be regarded by him as subjects, his instruments in the oppression of Israel. It may be that this version of the vision of Daniel has been less modified from the original than what has preceded. In the original document, Edom, Moab, and Ammon might have some symbolic reference. <span class="accented">The glorious land</span> can scarcely be other than Palestine. It is rendered by Ewald, "the land of the ornament" It might be rendered, "the land of the gazelle." Out of the thirty passages in which this word occurs in Scripture, fourteen times it must have this meaning, in some of the other cases it may have it. So far, then, as the name goes, it might apply to any country fitted for the habitation of the gazelle; but the mention of "Edom, Mesh, and Ammon" renders it nearly a necessity that the reference here be to Palestine. <span class="accented">Many countries shall be overthrown.</span> The verb used is <span class="accented">kashal</span>, which means, in the niphal, "to totter," "to fall," "to be weak." It is assumed by Hitzig and Fuller, as by the English versions, that "countries" is to be understood. Ewald, however, and many other commentators, following the older versions, would refer to men, and translate, "myriads shall fall." In the version from which Origen has supplemented the Septuagint it is rendered, "Many women or countries shall be offended (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)," the feminine rendering being due to the feminine termination <span class="accented">-oth</span> in <span class="accented">rabboth</span>, but the verb is masculine. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-42.htm">Daniel 11:42</a></div><div class="verse">He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall stretch forth his hand also</span> <span class="cmt_word">upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape</span>. The Septuagint rendering is, "And he shall send forth his hand upon the countries, and in the land of Egypt there shall not be a saviour in it." The first part of this verse is marked with an asterisk. Evidently the text before the translators had <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">lah pelaytah</span>), "to her deliverance," and "deliverance" in the abstract became "deliverer" in the concrete. Theodotion renders in a different sense, "And he shall stretch his hand upon the land, and the land of Egypt shall not be for salvation." The idea here is that for the land of Palestine, Egypt shall not be a deliverer. This, probably, is the true reading. The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic pretty closely, "He shall stretch  his hand over the countries, and the land of Egypt shall escape from his hands." The Vulgate has nothing to justify remark. Probably this verse, in the way it is rendered by Theodotion, is a portion of the lost vision of Daniel. The vagueness of "countries" stands in contrast to the definiteness of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, and is thus suspicious. Help was always expected from Egypt in the time when Assyria and Babylonia successively claimed the subjection of the Holy Land. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-43.htm">Daniel 11:43</a></div><div class="verse">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians <i>shall be</i> at his steps.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is somewhat fuller, "He shall have power over the place of gold and the place of silver, and over all the desire of Egypt, and Libyans and Ethiopians shall be in his multitude." The word translated "treasures" is a late one, but evidently the Septuagint translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">maqom</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. (<span class="accented">michemanay</span>). Theodotion renders, "And he shall have power over the secret hoards of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and of Libyans, and of AEthiopians in their fortresses." Theodotion has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">metzorayo</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">mitz'adoyo</span>). The Peshitta rendering is, "And he shall have power over the house of the treasures of gold and silver, and of the pleasant things of Egypt, and the Libyans, and the Cushites (Ethiopians) are his allies." The Vulgate follows a slightly different rendering, "And he shall rule the treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; through Libya and AEthiopia, too, shall he pass." Having a different reading in the last clause from the Massoretic, the natural Hebrew equivalent for <span class="accented">transibit</span> is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">ya'bor</span>) - <span class="accented">a</span> word that could scarcelv arise by mistake from that in the text. <span class="accented">He</span> <span class="accented">shall have power over the treasures of gold and silcer</span>, <span class="accented">and over all the precious things of Egypt.</span> Strictly speaking, this never was the case, as Antiochus never wholly conquered Egypt, although in that expedition, in which he had laid siege to Alexandria, he came very near completing his conquest. <span class="accented">And the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall beat his steps.</span> This certainly is not true in the sense in which Jerome takes it, "he shall pass through Libya and Ethiopia." Though Antiochus more than once invaded Egypt, he never passed further into Africa. These nationalities are associated with each other; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/46-8.htm">Jeremiah 46:8, 9</a>, we have, "The Ethiopians and the Libyans that handle the shield." So in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/30-5.htm">Ezekiel 30:5</a> we have the countries spoken of together. It may merely mean that individuals belonging to these nationalities had joined his armies. This is altogether a more ornate and poetical passage than the rest of this chapter, and gives the feeling of a different hand; therefore, probably, it belongs to a time nearer that of Daniel, and contains more of the original prophecy. Professor Fuller remarks on a reference being made to the help Ptolemy received from Cyprus. Cyprus, or Chittim, is referred to in the earlier part of this chapter, but not here. The Lubim and Cushim are contemporary with Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-44.htm">Daniel 11:44</a></div><div class="verse">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; there. fore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many</span>. The version of the Septuagint is very like this, "A rumour out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him, and he shall come out in great rage to lay waste with the sword, and to slay many." The version of Theodotion is somewhat briefer, "Rumours and disturbances out of the east and from the north shall trouble him, and he shall come in much wrath to destroy many." The Syriac is closer than any other version to the Massoretic text. The Vulgate renders, "A rumour out of the east and north shall trouble him, and he shall come with a great multitude that he may beat down and slay many." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hayma</span>) may mean either "wrath" or "multitude." It is difficult to identify the rumours that recalled Antiochus from his conquests. The account given by Porphyry (quoted by Jerome) of his receiving news that led him to ravage the coasts of Phoenicia and march against Armenia are unsupported by other historians. A phrase in Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:8) seems to throw light on this, "After the Macedonians held the supremacy, King Antiochus, when he was endeavouring to change the superstition of this people, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> the Jews, into the manners of the Greeks, was hindered by a Parthian war." There is, however, no record of such a Parthian war; but such a war may have arisen, and not be recorded, as the histories for the period before us are very incomplete. Should we regard these verses as giving another account of the war between Epiphanes and Ptolemy, the tidings out of the north might mean the arrival of the Roman envoys, headed by Popilius Lsenas. If there were also a threat of a Parthian invasion, we should then have, "tidings put of the east and north." <span class="accented">Therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy</span>, <span class="accented">and utterly to make away many.</span> Certainly Antiochus did return furious from the expedition in which he was stayed by the Romans; and certainly also he set himself thereafter  to compel the Jews to become Greeks in religion, punishing with death refusal to yield to his demands (1 Macc. 1:24-28; Josephus, 'Ant.,' 12:05. 3). 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a></div><div class="verse">And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</span> The rendering of the LXX. is, "Then shall he set up his tent between the seas and the mountains of the choice of the sanctuary, and the hour of his end shall come, and he shall have no helper." Theodotion's rendering is, "He shall pitch his tent Epha-dane between the seas at the holy mountain of Sabacin; he shall come to his lot, and there will not be a deliverer to him." It is to be observed that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5b9;</span> (<span class="accented">appadno</span>), "royal tent," a late word in Hebrew, was not present in the text before the translator of the Septuagint. Further, Theodotion did not know the meaning of the word, although his recension was prepared under Jewish supervision. The Peshitta renders, "And he shall place his tout on the plain space between the sea and the mountain, and shall assail its sanctuary, and he shall come to his end; there shall not be to him a helper." The Vulgate renders, "And he shall place his tabernacle, <span class="accented">aphadno</span>, between the two seas upon the glorious and holy mountain; he shall come even to its (his) highest point, and no one shall help him." <span class="accented">He shall plant the tabernacle of his palace.</span> The word here used (<span class="accented">appadno</span>) does not occur elsewhere, and seems to denote the royal tent. The fact that it does not appear in the Septuagint or Peshitta renders its right to be in the text somewhat doubtful. Theodotion and Jerome transliterate it, as if it had not got a place in Hebrew even in their day. It does occur in the Targum and the Peshitta. At the same time, a purely technical word like this might really be of ancient usage, yet the occasion for its use might not have previously occurred; the literature of ancient Hebrew is exceedingly limited. <span class="accented">Between the seas in the glorious holy mountain.</span> Havernick maintains that the glorious and holy mountain here is the mountain on which the temple of Nanaia was placed, and that the <span class="accented">seas</span> in question were the Caspian and the Persian Gulf. It is difficult to imagine a Jew calling the mountain on which a heathen temple was placed, "glorious holy," even were we sure that the temple in question was on a mountain, for which we have no evidence. The Jews probably knew of the sea into which the Euphrates discharged its waters; but it is not prominent in their writings, and the Caspian may be looked upon as unknown. The distance between these two seas is so great that no one would locate such a small thing as a city by saying that it was between them. The natural interpretation is that the seas in question are the Mediterranean - the great sea - and the Dead Sea - the Salt Sea. But the Hebrew leads rather to the idea that the plural is one of excellence. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">bayn</span>), "between," is not infrequently construed with <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">le</span>), "to," as here; hence the translation would be between the seas, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> the great sea and the holy mountain. There can be no doubt that "the glorious and holy mountain" is Mount Zion. <span class="accented">Yet he shall come to his end</span>, <span class="accented">and none shall help him.</span> The death of Antiochus, baffled in his attempt to rifle the temple of Nanaia, humiliated not only by his own disaster, but by the news received from Jerusalem, is full of disappointment and misery, even when we get rid of the rhetoric with which the events are clothed in Polybius and 1 and 2 Maccabees. One-half of his army under Lysias had been baffled and defeated by Judas Maccabaeus; he himself had been repulsed in his attempt to replenish his coffers; the, re is therefore for him no helper, so he dies of disappointment at Tabes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/10.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 10"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 10" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/12.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 12"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 12" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;

that day shall be a day of affliction, such as was not from the day when they were [presumably the Jews as a nation] till that day, and in that day every people shall be exalted whose name is found written in the book," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, "In that time shall stand up Michael, the great prince that standeth for the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as there has not been since there was a nation upon the earth till  that time: in that time shall thy people be saved, every one who is written in the book." The Peshitta rendering is, "At that time shall stand up Michael, the great angel who is overseer over the children of thy people, and it shall be a time of affliction such as has not been from the days of eternity; there shall be delivered of the children of thy people every one who is found written in the book." The rendering of the Vulgate is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The difference in the first clause between the text of the Septuagint and that represented by the Massoretic text and that of the versions which follow it is of importance. It is hardly possible to suggest any Hebrew word for the place which can have been suggested by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, the word used here for "time." Both versions of the clause look like attempts to supply a link of connection which was awanting in the text before them. This supports our idea that the eleventh chapter is mainly an interpolation. It would seem that the Septuagint translator had before him a text having some derivative possibly of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, perhaps in the passive of the pilpel, which has no extant example. <span class="accented">And at that time.</span> The connection would naturally imply the time of the destruction of the oppressor - the king of the south. When he was cut off "without a helper" would be a time one would expect of joy, not of affliction. It may refer to the coming of the oppressor from Egypt with "great rage." If that produced the great affliction, what is the result of Michael's standing up? It seems as if the connection here were hopelessly broken; some dislocation has occurred. <span class="accented">Michael the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people</span> (see <a href="../../par/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>). "Thy people," this pronominal suffix only occurs once in the previous chapter, in the fourteenth verse, in a clause that does not harmonize with the context - a clause that we think is a portion of the missing vision of Daniel. <span class="accented">Shall stand up.</span> This, taken in connection with his function, means he shall come for the help of Israel. <span class="accented">And there shall be a time of trouble</span>, <span class="accented">such as never was since there was a nation.</span> This is certainly not what might be expected to result from Michael arising for the deliverance of the people of God. It certainly may be intended to explain the fact that Michael does "stand up." But in the succeeding verses we have no account of special deliverance being given to Israel. The natural meaning of this would be that from the time that Israel began to be a nation there had not been such affliction. It might mean that never since there were nations had there been such a persecution. Father of these interpretations would be true. Never in the history of Israel had there been such a persecution, because the attempt to force the people to worship Jupiter was met by a far fiercer resistance than that which met Jezebel's attempt to make Israel worshippers of Baal. The people were not then so permeated with love and honour to Jehovah as they were now. Further, there was more kindred between Baal-worship and that of Jehovah originally than between the latter and the worship of Jupiter. Baal means simply" Lord," and Jehovah seems to have been worshipped under that title (<a href="../../par/hosea/2-16.htm">Hosea 2:16</a>). A collateral proof of this is the fact that Saul named one of his sons after "Baal" - Eshbaal (equivalent to Ishbosheth), <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; and Jonathan also named his son from Baal  - Meribaal (equivalent to Mephibesheth), <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>. The plea might thus be advanced that Baal-worship was a revival of an ancient cult. Hence the persecution, severe as it was, would not be so severe as tinder Antiochus. Yet, again, the Greek intellect, keen and polished as it was, could persecute in a way more thorough and complete. If fiercer persecution for religious views could not have been at any earlier time in Jewish history, in no other country would there have been any persecution at all, because there would have been no resist-ante to the will of the monarch. Our Lord, in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21</a>, has this passage in mind, and uses terms borrowed from it to describe the sufferings to be endured by the Jews at the hands of the Romans. when Jerusalem shall be besieged and taken. It is to be observed that while in Daniel the comparison is only with the past, in Matthew there is added a reference to the future, "No, nor ever shall be." Nothing, then, shall equal the appalling horrors of the siege and sack of Jerusalem. And <span class="accented">at that time thy people shall be delivered.</span> The mere fact of deliverance is mentioned, but the nature of the deliverance is not indicated there; cessation of persecution would not be deliverance, for only Israel was persecuted. The application of the phrases of our Lord have a totally different reference - the Jews perished, the Christians were delivered. There is here another evidence of dislocation. <span class="accented">Every one that shall be found written in the book.</span> There seems to be a faint reminiscence of this in <a href="../../par/philippians/4-3.htm">Philippians 4:3</a>, and a clearer in <a href="../../par/revelation/13-8.htm">Revelation 13:8</a>. Although "books" is here referred to, and referred to also in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-21.htm">Daniel 10:21</a>, yet the "books" are different. The "book" in the tenth chapter contains presumably an account beforehand of all that is to happen. This book is, so to speak, a register of the names of those who should stand through the fiery trial that was to try them and maintain their faithfulness. It is to be  noted that the Septuagint makes this refer not to individuals, but to nations whose names shall be found written in the book. There seems nothing to justify such a reading. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a></div><div class="verse">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame <i>and</i> everlasting contempt.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span> The Septuagint rendering is, "And many that sleep in the breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) of the earth shall arise, some to life eternal, and some to reproach, some to dispersion (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span>) and eternal shame." These terms, "reproach" and "dispersion," are different attempts to render <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">haraphoth</span>), "reproaches." The differences between the above and Theodotion are merely verbal; "dispersion" is omitted, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "dust," is instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, The rendering of the Peshitta is, "And many of those that sleep in the dust shall awake, some to life everlasting, and some to destruction and contempt of their friends for ever." The Vulgate has a somewhat singular version of the last clause, "And many that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to life eternal, and some to contempt, in order that they may always see it (<span class="accented">ut videant semper</span>)." <span class="accented">Many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth.</span> Sleep, as a symbol of death, is frequent, both in the Old Testament and the New: <a href="../../par/psalms/13-3.htm">Psalm 13:3</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-13.htm">Job 3:13</a>; for the New Testament, <a href="../../par/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="../../par/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>. "Dust" is a common phrase for the grave: <a href="../../par/job/7-21.htm">Job 7:21</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/22-30.htm">Psalm 22:30</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/30-10.htm">Psalm 30:10</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>. The reference here is to those who are not only dead, but buried. The phrase translated, "dust of the earth," literally means "earth of dust." The phrase is so singular that Professor Robertson Smith has suggested that instead of reading '<span class="accented">admath</span> '<span class="accented">aphar</span>, we should read '<span class="accented">armath</span> '<span class="accented">aphar</span> - <span class="accented">aram in</span> Arabic meaning a "cairn" or "mound." There is, however, as Professor Bevan remarks, no instance in Hebrew or Aramaic of such a word being in use. It is assumed that the reference here (Behrmann, etc.) is to the Jews alone; but for this assumption there is no justification. While, on the one hand, one cannot prove from this that others besides Israel shall partake in the resurrection; on the other, as little can we assert that "the Jews," at the period when this verse was written, excluded all but Jews. We cannot deduce that" many" here excludes "all." The idea suggested is rather multitudinousness. <span class="accented">Shall awake</span>, <span class="accented">sores to everlasting life</span>, <span class="accented">and some to shame and everlasting contempt.</span> This is a distinct reference to the resurrection of the body; it is those that "sleep in the dust" that shall thus "awake." It is to be noted that at the resurrection the condition of each is fixed frailly - it is to "everlasting life" and "over-lasting contempt" This resurrection is individual, not national, as shown by the contrasted fates. The doctrine of the resurrection is thus clearly stated. There is no need to examine how much the Jews of the time of the Maccabees understood of this doctrine. <a href="../../par/isaiah/26-14.htm">Isaiah 26:14-19</a>, as clearly as does this passage, proclaims the same belief. <a href="../../par/ezekiel/37-1.htm">Ezekiel 37:1-14</a> shows that resurrection was to the Israelites not such an incongruous or impossible idea as it was to the Greeks. But when is this? We might be led by the juxtaposition of this to the account of the sufferings of the Jews under Antiochus, to think that the writer believed the end of the world would take place immediately on the fall of Antiochus. But in the first place we must remember that we have not the vision given to Daniel; it has been replaced by the eleventh chapter. Further, the method of prophecy must be borne in mind. The future was made known in vision. If, as seems probable, distance in space from the apparent standpoint of the prophet represented distance in time from his actual or assumed chronological position, then, if the description of the vision proceeded from one side of the picture to the other, those things would be in close juxtaposition which were to be far removed from each other chronologically. Thus an astronomer may place in the same constellation stars inconceivably distant from each other - nay, may even unite as one binary star two suns, the one nearer the earth than the other by thousands of millions of miles. So our Lord correlates the destruction of Jerusalem with the end of the world. Moreover, the misery endured by the Jewish saints under Antiochus was a type of the sufferings of the people of God of every age. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-3.htm">Daniel 12:3</a></div><div class="verse">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.</span> The rendering of the LXX. differs from this considerably, "Those who understand shall appear as the lights of heaven, and those that confirm my word as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." There seems to be a difference of reading in the first clause. Instead of <span class="accented">yazheeroo kezohar</span>, there seems to have been <span class="accented">yayraro kim'ooroth.</span> The verb used in the Massoretic text means really "admonish." The noun occurs only in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/13-2.htm">Ezekiel 13:2</a>. In the last clause, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">harabbeem</span>), "many," the Septuagint has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">deboray</span>), "my words." It is difficult to account for the omission of the final <span class="hebrew">&#x20;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="accented">unless</span> from the likeness of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and  and  (see Corpus Insc. Semit.). Theodotion renders, "And they that understand shall shine as the <span class="accented">brightness</span> of the firmament, and certain from amongst the righteous as the stars for  ever and ever." The Peshitta rendering is somewhat paraphrastic, "Those that do good and are wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and those who conquer many shall be lights, and arise as the stars of heaven for ever and ever." The Vulgate is in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The versions are superior to our Authorized, in having "those that understand" instead of "those that be wise." Bevan regards the wise here as the "teachers." There seems, however, no reason for such a restriction. The reading of the Septuagint in the opening clause of the second member of the sentence is inferior, as confirming or justifying the words of Daniel or of God is a simpler idea than that of turning many to righteousness. Further, there is a difficulty of fixing who is referred to by the prenominal suffix "my." Professor Fuller refers to <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-11.htm">Isaiah 51:11</a> for a parallel use of the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>; but there, as elsewhere, it means, not "turn to righteousness," but "justify," that is, "declare righteous." Yet the connection between the two ideas is close, and the forensic idea can have no place here. <a href="../../par/matthew/13-43.htm">Matthew 13:43</a> represents a similar reward to the righteous. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-4.htm">Daniel 12:4</a></div><div class="verse">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, <i>even</i> to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased</span>. The Septuagint rendering in the last portion of the verse is totally different from the Masserotic recension, which is correctly rendered in our English version, "And thou, Daniel, hide the commands and seal the book till the time of the end, till many shall rave violently (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) and the earth be filled with unrighteousness." It is possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bb;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">yeshoogg'oo</span>), "were mad," was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">yishoetoo</span>), "ran to and fro." In the older script <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>. was not unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span>. Professor Bevan has suggested that instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">hadda'th</span>), "the knowledge," the Septuagint translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">hara'oth</span>), "the evils," and thinks that this gives the Septuagint Greek. Were one, however, to render the Greek back into Hebrew, that would not be the form the words would take. It may, however, be regarded as a paraphrase. Theodotion's version is closer to the Massoretic, "And thou, Daniel, shalt guard (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, ('make a fence round') the words, and seal the book till the time of the end, till many shall be taught, and knowledge shall be fulfilled." Theodotion here takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span> as meaning, not "run to and fro," but "peruse carefully." The last clause somewhat justifies Professor Bevan's suggestion: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> used to mean "fulfil" or "fill out." The Peshitta renders, "And thou, then, Daniel, seal these commands, render silent, and seal this book till the time of the end, and many shall inquire, and knowledge shall be increased." The Vulgate agrees on the whole with the Massoretic text. <span class="accented">Shut up the words.</span> The exact rendering of the words is "close up;" hence Theodotion's rendering "put a rampart round," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">satham</span>), means generally "to stop up a well;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/2_kings/3-19.htm">2 Kings 3:19</a>; <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/32-30.htm">2 Chronicles 32:30</a>; <a href="../../par/genesis/26-15.htm">Genesis 26:15</a>. In <a href="../../par/nehemiah/4-1.htm">Nehemiah 4:1</a> (7) it is used of stopping the breaches in the wall; only in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a> and <a href="../../par/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a> (6) is the word rendered, even in the English versions, "hidden;" but even in these cases that is not the necessary or even the natural meaning of the woful. These remarks apply also to <a href="../../par/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>. <span class="accented">Seal the book.</span> There is a question as to the force of this phrase. Does it mean, as Hitzig, Bevan, and the critical school generally maintain it means, that the book was to be hidden and concealed? This view, if correct, would certainly give a plausibility to the contention that the book of Daniel is the work of a <span class="accented">falsarisu.</span> We have seen, however, that the real meaning of the verb translated "shut up" is not "conceal," but "to shut up" with the view certainly of hindering access to them, but not at all with the intention of concealment. So the "sealing" here does not necessarily indicate concealment, but rather the conclusion of the matter with further idea of confirmation. The oracles of God are regarded as a spring of water; if we follow the figure implied in the first word used, the flow is stopped now; so far as this message is concerned, nothing more is to be drawn from the fountain. But a fountain may also be sealed (see <a href="../../par/songs/4-12.htm">Song of Solomon 4:12</a>, "A garden enclosed, a fountain sealed"). In that case there is no idea of concealment. The book, then, of the prophecy is to be sealed against any change or addition. Even take the view of the critics, there is here no elaborate directions as to the concealment of the vision as we find in the case of the 'Assumption of Moses.' But further, we have no account of the finding of the book. Daniel was not like the 'Assumption of Moses,' the esoteric possession of a single sect, it was on the critical hypothesis soon known all over Palestine and Egypt. We know that the finding of the book of the Law in the reign of Josiah is narrated in <a href="../../par/2_kings/22.htm">2 Kings 22</a>. and <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/34.htm">2 Chronicles 34</a>; but neither 1 Maccabees nor 2 Maccabees says a word about the finding of the Book of Daniel. Josephus also has no word of the discovery of Daniel, although he relates the finding of the book of the Law in the days of Josiah. There must have been no tradition of such a thing taking place, yet two centuries was not so long as to obliterate tradition. The sealing had  metaphorical meaning - a book sealed, though it was visible to the eye, and was not hidden away - could not be read. If the key by which to interpret it is not granted, a book in cipher cannot be read (comp. <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-11.htm">Isaiah 29:11, 12</a>, "And the vision of all is become unto you as a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed. And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned." If the book were sealed that it could not be opened, the delivering of the book and the request to read it would be meaningless). Prophecy was delivered frequently in enigmatic language, and the meaning of it could only be grasped when circumstance supplied the key. <span class="accented">To the time of the end.</span> The end is not the end of the persecution of the days of Antiochus - that is already past; we have now reached the consummation of all things. <span class="accented">Many shall run to and fro</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge shall be increased.</span> This is to be looked upon as a description of the last time, when circumstance shall remove the seal from the book. The translator of the Septuagint has been led away by the idea of the time as one of sorrow. The verb, however, translated "going to and fro" may be rendered, as it is by Ewald, as "to peruse." The veil then shall be removed, the seals broken when men peruse the prophecy carefully, and knowledge is increased.

The abrupt introduction of "two other' is another proof that the long eleventh chapter, as we have it now, is an interpolation. We must go back to <a href="../../par/daniel/10-18.htm">Daniel 10:18</a> to get the person from whom these two mentioned are distinguished. The two new <span class="accented">dramatis personae</span> are, as Professor Bevan remarks, in all likelihood angels, and the river in question is the Tigris. In ch. 10. Hiddekel is <span class="accented">nahar</span>; here the word used is <span class="accented">yeor</span>, a word very often used of the Nile, but not exclusively (see <a href="../../par/isaiah/33-21.htm">Isaiah 33:21</a>). Hitzig asserts that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">y'or</span>) is an Egyptian appellative, made by the Hebrews into the proper name of the Nile. The example just given disproves this statement, and from this false premise he deduces that the Book of Daniel was written in Egypt. They may be angels of countries. There seems nothing to justify the idea that Michael and Gabriel are the two here intended - the word "other" excludes this. The reason of this introduction of two angels is, Professor Bevan thinks, as witnesses to the oath of the angel. But an oath, to be binding, did not need witnesses; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when David sware to Jonathan, there were no witnesses. Another idea may be hazarded  - the Tigris may be looked upon as the boundary of the East and the West; and the two other angels may be the angelic guardians of these two regions. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-6.htm">Daniel 12:6</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>one</i> said to the man clothed in linen, which <i>was</i> upon the waters of the river, How long <i>shall it be to</i> the end of these wonders?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> The Septuagint renderingis, "And I said" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> - "to one clothed in fair linen (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>), which is above the water of the river" - the last five words being omitted from the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis - "When, then, shall the end be of these marvels which thou hast told me, and their purification?" The last clause, which does not represent anything in the Massoretic, is due to a confusion between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>, with which the next verse begins, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, as usual, closer to the Massoretic, "and he said to the man clothed in <span class="accented">baddin</span>, who was upon the waters of the river, When shall be the end of those marvels of which thou speakest?" Both the Greek versions insert "of which thou speakest." The rendering of the Peshitta differs slightly, "And they said" - a reading that one would be wishful to adopt if it had any probability in its favour - "to the man clothed in beautiful apparel, who was standing above the waters of the river, Until when shall the end of these things be?" The omission of "wonders" is to be observed. The Vulgate follows the Septuagint in making Daniel the speaker, "And I said to the man clothed in linen, who was standing over the waters of the river, When shall be the end of these marvels?" <span class="accented">And one said.</span> Aben Ezra makes this one of the two who spoke. This suggestion is the most natural, only the sentence is singularly abrupt, and favours the idea that there is an omission here. The LXX. and Vulgate, as we have seen, read, "I <span class="accented">said."</span> While the reading is an easy one, it is, as Professor Bevan remarks, against the analogy of <a href="../../par/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>. <span class="accented">To the man clothed in linen.</span> This man is mentioned in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-5.htm">Daniel 10:5</a>, presumably Gabriel. <span class="accented">Which was upon the waters of the river.</span> The reference may be to <a href="../../par/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>, where a voice comes to him from between the banks of the river Ulai. Here, not upon the waters of the river Tigris, but over them, was the appearance of the angel Gabriel. <span class="accented">How long shall it be to the end of these wonders?</span> One difficulty that strikes one is that there are no wonders foretold. That the rulers of Syria should war against the possessors of Egypt was not a marvellous  thing. Professor Bevan, who holds that the marvels referred to are the events foretold, quotes <a href="../../par/isaiah/29-14.htm">Isaiah 29:14</a> as a parallel instance, but, though marvels are there mentioned, such marvels that all the wisdom of the wise should fail, etc., yet here nothing is told of the nature of these marvels. Had there been visions of symbolic animals, as in the seventh and eighth chapters, we could have understood these things being spoken of as marvels. The probability, then, is heightened that there have been omissions as well as insertions here. The time contemplated is the end, when judgment and resurrection are passed. It is, in fact, the question of the apostles (<a href="../../par/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>), "Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?" 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-7.htm">Daniel 12:7</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard the man clothed in linen, which <i>was</i> upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that <i>it shall be</i> for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these <i>things</i> shall be finished.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard the man clothed in</span> <span class="cmt_word">linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.</span> The Septuagint essentially agrees with this. It omits "man" in the first clause; has "water" instead of "waters;" adds "God" as explanatory of "him that liveth for ever;" it renders "scatter the power" by "loose the hands." Theodotion, while agreeing with the Massoretic text as to the first portion of the verse, differs very much in the end. He renders, "when the scattering is finished, they shall know these things." There is, as will be seen, no reference to the "holy people." His manuscript must have omitted "holy," for the rest may be explained by a false division into words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dd;</span> being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;</span> The Massoretic reading is to be preferred. The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remark. <span class="accented">When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven.</span> The lifting up the hand, in sign of making a solemn asseveration, is used of God himself (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>), of Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a>), of the angel in the passage in Revelation founded on this (<a href="../../par/revelation/10-5.htm">Revelation 10:5</a>). Here the fact that both right hand and left hand are lifted up to heaven gives greater solemnity to the act. <span class="accented">And sware by him that liveth for ever.</span> This title is ascribed to God in <a href="../../par/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a> (31); also in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>; the idea is involved in the name Jehovah (Yahveh). The relationship between the oath and the ascription to God, on whose faithfulness its fulfilment depended, is obvious, The fact that the "man clothed in linen" thus "swears" implies that in some way he is the source of the determination of the period. This notion is involved in the whole spiritual scenery of the Book of Daniel; the angels of the nations are the agents under God for carrying out the decrees of providence. <span class="accented">That it shall be for a time</span>, <span class="accented">times</span>, <span class="accented">and an half.</span> This is a space of time repeatedly used in the Biblical apocalypses (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>; <a href="../../par/revelation/12-14.htm">Revelation 12:14</a>). In <a href="../../par/revelation/11-3.htm">Revelation 11:3</a>, the same period seems to be represented by twelve hundred and sixty days. In the present case twelve hundred and ninety days seem to be regarded as equivalent to the "time, times, and an half (ver. 11). The divergency of interpretation comes to its height here. A great number of interpreters - not merely those of the critical school - maintain that "time" here is a literal year, and the days of the succeeding verses literal days, and that the period in question is that between the desecration of the temple by Antiochus's orders, and the setting up "the abomination of desolation" (1 Macc. 1:54), till the Jews were able to sacrifice once more in the re-consecrated temple (1 Macc. 4:52). This period, however, is only ten days over the three years from the 15th Casleu, 145 of the era of the Seleucids, to the 25th Casleu, 148. Or, if we take the date from the time that sacrifices to Jupiter began, till the re-establishment of the worship of Jehovah, it is then exactly three years from the 25th Casleu to the 25th Casleu. This period is not sufficient. Professor Moses Stuart gets over the difficulty by reckoning back from the cleansing of the temple to what he consider, the probable date of Antiochus's entrance into Jerusalem on his retreat from Egypt. This, however, is arbitrary, as the eleventh verse makes the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span> the setting up of the "abomination of desolation," which occurred in 145, Seleucid era. Professor Bevan would reckon to the death of Antiochus. Of this event we only know it happened in 149, Seleucid era (1 Macc. 6:16). If the year began, as the Maceabaean reckoning seems to have been, with the month Nisan, it might be that approximately three years and a half was the time from the desecration of the temple to the death of Anti-ochua But the death of Antiochus produced but little change on the condition of the Jews. In the following year Lysias inflicted a defeat on Judas and besieged Jerusalem, and captured a portion of the city. To some extent we have anticipated our remarks on this text when considering <a href="../../par/daniel/7-25.htm">Daniel 7:25</a>. There are, however, peculiarities due to the fact that Aramaic, not Hebrew, is the language used in that passage. <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">mo'ed</span>), here rendered "time." is translated "congregation" most generally in the Peutatcuch. Sometimes it is "feast," and sometimes it is "season;"  but if the word here means a definite period of time, it is the only case in which it does so, and it is a word that appears several hundreds of times in the Scriptures. We admit that the enumeration of days which follows renders the assertion that <span class="accented">mo'ed</span> means here a "year," to some extent plausible, yet only plausible. But the next question arises - Even though we should grant that it means a year, are we to understand a literal year? We saw that the "weeks" of ch. 9. are not to be taken literally, but as weeks of years, in which each day stands for a year; the contention of the traditional interpreters has then a justification from analogy in taking a <span class="accented">mo'ed</span>, if a "year," to be one of three hundred and sixty or three hundred and sixty-five years. Not only is the extent of time indicated here extremely doubtful, but the <span class="accented">terminus a qao</span> is also. Although the writer of 1 Maccabees fixes the setting up the abomination of desolation, that is only his interpretation. Our Lord, on the other hand, refers it to the Roman conquest of Jerusalem, which was a vastly more thorough destruction than that inflicted by Antiochus. The meaning of this period is not fixed yet. <span class="accented">When he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people.</span> Professor Bevan would change the reading here, as from the order of the Greek words in the Septuagint he deduces that the order in the text before the translator was different from that in the Massoretic text. He would render, "When the power of the shatterer of the holy people shall come to an end." Behrmann sees grammatical difficulties, but these are not cogent; but the argument for this change is weak. Yet we prefer, though with difficulty, Professor Bevan's reading. It makes the connection much simpler to take this solution, as the end of all things is not the scattering of the holy people, but their building up. If we had any authority from the versions we should be inclined to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, and insert <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> before <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, and thus would wish to render, "From the breaking of the power of the scatterer of the holy people till all these things are ended." This gives beth <span class="accented">termini</span>, but none of the versions gives any hint of such a reading. <span class="accented">All these things shall be finished.</span> As the resurrection is mentioned in the second verse, we might at once assume that this refers to the end of time; but <a href="../../par/matthew/24-34.htm">Matthew 24:34</a>, compared with 30, renders this conclusion doubtful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-8.htm">Daniel 12:8</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what <i>shall be</i> the end of these <i>things</i>?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord, what shall be</span> <span class="cmt_word">the end of these things?</span> The Septuagint rendering differs in a somewhat singular way from the above, "And I heard and understood not, especially about this time; and I said, Lord, what is the solution of this word, and what are those parables?" These variations seem due to glosses and paraphrase. Theodotion is in complete agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only by inserting "Daniel." The Vulgate renders the last clause, <span class="accented">Quid erit post haec?</span> "What will be after these things?" Daniel understood the words, but by hypothesis he did not understand the meaning of them. This exhibits the relation of the prophet always to the revelations given - his faculty of understanding was totally independent of the receptive faculty by which he received the revelation. If we assume this as representing a fact, then all arguments which are grounded on the meanings which the prophet himself might see in his words are beside the question. Since he does not understand, he appeals to the angelic messenger, who had declared so much. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-9.htm">Daniel 12:9</a></div><div class="verse">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words <i>are</i> closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Go thy way, Daniel; for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.</span> The Septuagint omits the last clause, and completes this verse from that which succeeds, "And he said, Depart, Daniel; for the commands are veiled and sealed until many shall be tried and shall be sanctified." Theodotion renders, "Come, Daniel, because the words are fenced and sealed till the time of the end." The Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. <span class="accented">Go thy way</span>, <span class="accented">Daniel.</span> This is a refusal to grant Daniel's prayer, but in the refusal no condemnation of Daniel is implied. The oracles were sealed until circumstance broke the seal. The purpose of prophecy was not to enable men to write history beforehand. It is to be a sign that, recognized in its fulfilment, may afford evidence of the Divinity of the message or person to whom it referred. <span class="accented">Closed up and sealed.</span> This verse gives us the real meaning of these words. Daniel's oracles were not concealed and sealed from being read, but because they were not interpreted they were not understood. For even to Daniel they are "closed up and sealed." <span class="accented">Till the time of the end.</span> This is omitted, as may be seen above, from the Septuagint. Although this has a satisfactory meaning, yet it seems better to connect this verse more directly with that which follows. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-10.htm">Daniel 12:10</a></div><div class="verse">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand.</span> As before observed, the Septuagint takes the first words of this verse and joins them to the verse preceding, omitting, however, one of the three stages of the process. The rest of the verse is, "And the sinners shall sin, and none of the sinners shall understand,  and the wise shall attend." The version of Theodotion is longer than the Massoretic, "Many shall be chosen and made white, and tested, and sanctified; and none of the transgressors shall understand, and the wise shall understand." The additional stage is probably due to a "doublet." The Peshitta rendering is, "Many shall be chosen, and made white, and tried; and the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the sinners shall understand; but those that then do good shall understand." The Vulgate rendering is, "And many shall be chosen, and made white, and tried as by fire; and the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the learned shall understand." It is to be observed that all the versions take the hithpael of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> as if they were the passives of the kal - a view that shows the grammatical influence of the Aramaic dialects. This verse as a whole is paraphrased in <a href="../../par/revelation/22-11.htm">Revelation 22:11</a>, "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still." <span class="accented">Many shall be purified</span>, <span class="accented">and made tchite.</span> If we keep strictly to the meaning of the hithpael, we ought to render, "Many shall purify themselves and make themselves white," as the Revised renders. When men make a sincere effort after purity, then the Lord is ready to help them. <a href="../../par/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, "If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine." Then, when men were thus striving after purity, would the meaning of Daniel's prophecy be made known. An age in which there is great religious fervour is never one in which men are conscious of prevailing goodness; on the contrary, it is one when men are conscious of prevailing evil in themselves and others. Hence the Book of Daniel could not have been written in the age of the Maccabees; by their very earnestness they would be conscious of moral and spiritual defects in themselves and others, and would not reckon their age one in which special revelations could be expected. <span class="accented">Tried.</span> The reference implied in the word used is trying by fire - after these saints have purified themselves they are tested by fire. <span class="accented">But the wicked shall do wickedly.</span> No amount of affliction will of itself produce purity. The northern tribes were oppressed by Hazael, but that did not work any change in them. The most striking example of this in all history is the siege of Jerusalem, The sufferings of the siege made the besieged more utterly lawless than before. Our Lord interprets a portion of this passage as referring to this siege. <span class="accented">None</span> <span class="accented">of the wicked shall understand</span>; <span class="accented">but the wise shall understand.</span> This again repeats the doctrine that effort after holiness is necessary to understanding God's ways. The historical instance above cited proves the truth of the statement here. The Christians, who were the wise in the sense of those that considered and sought after God, understood the signs of the times, and left Jerusalem; but none of the wicked understood, and so perished in the fall of the city.

The Septuagint is, "From <span class="cmt_word">the</span> time the sacrifice is taken away for ever, and the abomination of desolation is prepared to be set up, are a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> ('<span class="accented">olath</span>) before him, and read it <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">olah</span>), else he could not have translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bb;&#x5d3;</span> "for ever," and written "sacrifice" also. The Hebrew copyist, following the usage of Palestine, which makes "sacrifice" understood after "continual," had omitted it in the text followed by the Massoretes. Theodotion's rendering is, "From the time of the change of the daily sacrifice (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) and the abomination of desolation set up ("given," <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is a thousand two hundred and ninety days." The Peshitta and Vulgate do not call for remarks. This verse is a veritable cruz <span class="accented">interpretum. From the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away.</span> This event is referred to in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>. Whether the eleventh chapter is earlier or later is in our opinion scarcely doubtful. Also in <a href="../../par/daniel/8-11.htm">Daniel 8:11</a> we have the taking away of the daily sacrifice mentioned as one of the deeds of Antiochus. While the reference in ch. 11. and ch. 8. is to the action of Antiochus, it is not necessary to maintain that this refers to him; other oppressors might take away the daily sacrifice. This clause certainly seems to give the <span class="accented">terminus a quo</span>, but it is difficult to fix the date in question. Certainly from the fact that the words used here are used by the writer of the eleventh chapter to describe the actions of Antiochus, and that in 1 Macc. 1:54 there is also a similar identification, we might be inclined to take the event here mentioned as the starting-point of the twelve hundred and ninety days. But the acknowledged impossibility of fitting the days to the chronology militates against this view. <span class="accented">And the abomination that maketh desolate set up.</span> At first sight the reader is inclined to follow Wieseler, and regard this as a statement of the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem.</span> The grammatical difficulties against this  view are forcible. Although <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from" and "to," are sometimes used for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> ... <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, "from... until," it is rare, and the intrusion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;</span>, "and," is strong against this interpretation. Yet it seems strange that two <span class="accented">termini a quo</span> should be assigned and no ter<span class="accented">minus ad quota. A thousand two hundred and ninety days.</span> While this seems to be the same period as that reckoned in the seventh verse, "a time, times, and half a time," yet it is not absolutely coincident. It is thirty days more than three and a half times the prophetic year of three hundred and sixty, and eleven days more than three and a half mean solar years. As we have already said, if we take the profanation of the temple, 25th Casleu, 145 Seleucid era, as our starting-point, it is impossible to fix any great deliverance or any event of importance which happened some three years and seven months after. Antiochus may have died seven months after the news arrived of the reconsecration of the temple; but we have no data. As above stated, the death of Antiochus wrought but little alteration in the condition of the Jews. If we regard the days as literal days, there is one period that nearly coincides with the twelve hundred and ninety days - our Lord's ministry upon the earth. It is difficult to understand how our Lord's commencing his ministry was the removing of the daily sacrifice. Yet in the "heavenlies" it might be so. Further, we sometimes reckon "from" a period to come, as we can say, "We are yet  -  weeks from harvest, midsummer, or Christmas." So the Crucifixion as the fulfilment of all the sacrifices of the Law may be regarded as their removal. Certainly in his crucifixion was the real abomination which maketh desolate set up. It suits the next verse. From our Lord's crucifixion to his ascension there would be exactly forty-five days if, as is commonly believed, his ascension, as his resurrection, took place on a Sunday. This, however, is merely a thought thrown out. If we take the date indicated by our Lord, the war against the Jews, dating from Vespasian's march to Ptolemais in the beginning of A.D.  to the capture of the temple and the cessation of the daily sacrifice (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:02. 1), is not far off twelve hundred and ninety days. From this to the final capture of the city is close upon forty-five days. If we, however, take a day for a year, then another series of possible solutions are before us, all more or less faulty. One has the merit of postponing the solution to a date still future. The capture of Jerusalem by the Arabs in A.D.  is made the starting-point; if we add to that twelve hundred and ninety years, we have A.D. . The Mohammedan power may have fallen by that time; anything may have happened then. All these various solutions, all more or less unsatisfactory, prove that no solution is possible. If the fulfilment is yet in the future, circumstances may convey to us the interpretation. We must remember the vision was sealed to "the time of the end." Professor Fuller suggests that Babylonian discovery may at some future date throw light on Daniel's use of numbers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-12.htm">Daniel 12:12</a></div><div class="verse">Blessed <i>is</i> he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty</span> <span class="cmt_word">days.</span> None of the versions occasion any remark. <span class="accented">Blessed is he that waiteth.</span> It might be rendered, <span class="accented">Oh the blessed-nesses of him that waiteth!</span> This implies that forty-five days or years after the unknown event that terminates the twelve hundred and ninety days, another event of yet more surpassing interest, and fraught with yet greater benefit, shall occur. It seems most natural to regard this period as including in it that which precedes, though there is no grammatical reason why this period should not commence at the expiry of the twelve hundred and ninety days. In the latter case we are fully more at sea than before. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/12-13.htm">Daniel 12:13</a></div><div class="verse">But go thou thy way till the end <i>be</i>: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at the end of the days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at</span> <span class="cmt_word">the end of the days.</span> The Septuagint Version here differs considerably from the Massoretic, "Go thy way and rest, for there are days and hours till the fulfilment of the end; and thou shalt rest and arise to thy glory at the end of days." Theodotion closely resembles the LXX. in his rendering of this verse, "But go thou and rest, for there are yet days and hours to the fulfilment of the end, and thou shalt arise in thy lot at the end of days." The Pesbitta renders, "Go, Daniel, to the end, rest and arise at thy time at the end of days." The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic text. As to the additional clause which appears in the version of the LXX. and in Theodotion, Origen has appended the mark which indicates that these words were only found in the LXX., or, at all events, had nothing corresponding to them in the Hebrew text of his day. <span class="accented">Go thou thy way.</span> Daniel is dismissed in peace, without having his question answered. Before Daniel was a course, and on that course he was to go, without occupying his thoughts with this secret thing. There is no word for "way" in the Hebrew or in any of the older versions. <span class="accented">Till the end.</span> The versions transpose this clause with that which follows. "The end" is not naturally the end of Daniel's life, for that ought to be "thy end;" still, the next clause seems  to necessitate this. Hitzig would interpret the word <span class="accented">qaytz</span> as "goal" (<span class="accented">ziel</span>); but it is not the usual meaning of the word, and is not so used elsewhere in this passage. Professor Robertson Smith's suggestion (Bevan, 207), that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">qaytz</span>) is due to a mistake of a copyist, who has inserted it wrongly, is worthy of consideration. <span class="accented">For thou shalt rest.</span> This is rendered by Hitzig, "und magst ruhig sein" - "and you may be at rest." The fulfilment of the prophecy was fur a time long future, and Daniel need not disturb himself. Against this interpretation is the fact that the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nuah</span>), here translated "rest," never has the subjective meaning which Hitzig here attaches to it. The natural view is that of Ewald and most interpreters - "rest" in the grave. <span class="accented">And strand in thy lot at the end of the days.</span> In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/13-25.htm">Jeremiah 13:25</a> "lot" is used for what is assigned by the judgment of God. "Standing in the lot" primarily suggests one taking possession of what has been assigned by Divine judgment. It is objected by Hitzig that the verb "to stand" does not mean to rise from the dead, which is true; but the connection necessitates this meaning, and as the idea of resurrection had not received theological definition, no technical word would have the exclusive claim to be used. Even now we do not always use "resurrection," and in poetry rarely do. "The end of days" must mean the end of time after the resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/11.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 11"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 11" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../hosea/1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Hosea 1"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/1.htm"><title>Daniel 1 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/1.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/1-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../ezekiel/48.htm" title="Ezekiel 48">&#9668;</a> Daniel 1 <a href="../daniel/2.htm" title="Daniel 2">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-1.htm">Daniel 1:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim King of Judah</span>.

The Syriac Version omits the statement that it was "part" of the vessels of the house of God that was taken. It is to be observed that our translators have not printed the word "Lord" in capitals, but in ordinary type, to indicate that the word in the original is not the sacred covenant name usually written in English "Jehovah," but <span class="accented">Adonai.</span> That the Lord gave Jehoiakim into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar does not prove that Jerusalem was captured by him. Far from it, the natural deduction is rather that he did not capture the city, although he captured the king. Thus in <a href="../../par/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a> we are told that Shalmaneser shut up Hoshea "and bound him in prison;" in the following verse we are informed that the King of Assyria "besieged Samaria three years." That is to say, after Shalmaneser had captured Hoshea the king, he had still to besiege the city. A similar event occurred earlier in the history of Judah and Israel. When Joash of Israel defeated Amaziah and took him prisoner, he proceeded then to Jerusalem. The city opened its gates to the conqueror, and he carried off all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, and all the vessels of the house of the Lord, and a large number of hostages, and then returned north. Something like this seems to have occurred now. The king was taken by the Babylonians, and the city submitted and ransomed the king by handing over a portion of the vessels of the house of the Lord. The city, however, was not taken by assault. <span class="accented">Miqtzath</span>, "part of," occurs also in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/7-70.htm">Nehemiah 7:70</a> in this sense: we have it three times later in this chapter- vers. 5, 15, and 18; but in these cases it means "end." A word consonantally the same occurs in the sense before us in <a href="../../par/judges/18-2.htm">Judges 18:2</a>, translated "<span class="accented">coasts."</span> Gesenius would write the word <span class="accented">miqq tzath</span>, and regard <span class="accented">mi</span> as representing the partitive preposition <span class="accented">min.</span> He would therefore translate, "He took some from the numbtr of the <span class="accented">vessels."</span> Kranichfeld objects to Hitzig's assertion that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> means "a part," and is followed by Keil and Zockler in regarding it, as a short form of the phrase, "from end to end," equivalent to the whole, thus making <span class="accented">miqtzath</span> mean "a portion from the whole." The omission from the Syriac of the words which indicate that the vessels taken were only a portion of those in the house of the Lord, shows how natural it was to imagine that the deportation was total, and therefore we may lay the more emphasis on its presence as proving that the temple was not plundered, but these vessels were the ransom paid for the freedom of the king. Several times had the treasures of the house of God been taken away. In the days of Rehoboam (<a href="../../par/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>) Shishak, acting probably as the ally of Jeroboam, took away all the treasures of the house of the Lord, and of the king's house, "he even took away all." It may be doubted whether Jerusalem was captured (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/12-7.htm">2 Chronicles 12:7</a>); certainly the name of Jerusalem has not been identified in the list of captured towns on the wall of the temple at Karnak. We have referred to the case of Joash and Amaziah. The succession of the phrases," Jehoiakim King of Judah," and "part of the vessels of the house of God," is remarked by Ewald as being abrupt, and he would insert," together with the noblest of the land." There is, however, no trace of any such omission to be found in the versions. It is possible that this chapter may be the work of the early collector and editor, and that he condensed this portion as well <span class="accented">as</span>, not unlikely, translated it from Aramaic into Hebrew. Captives certainly were taken as well as booty, as is implied by the rest of the narrative. <span class="accented">Which he carried into the land of Shinar to</span>, <span class="accented">the house of his god.</span> There is no word in the Hebrew corresponding to" which." The literal rendering is, "And he carried them," etc. It has been the subject of discussion whether we are to maintain that it is  asserted here that Jeboiakim, along with the vessels and unmentioned captives, were carried to Babylon. Professor Bevan admits that it is doubtful. Were we dependent merely on grammar, certainly the probability, though not the certainty, would be that the plural suffix was intended to cover Jehoi-skim, but the conclusion forced on us by logic is different. He "carried them (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>) to the house of his god." This seems to imply that only the vessels are spoken cf. So strongly is this felt by Hitzig ('Das Buch Daniel,' 5) that he would regard the phrase, "the house of his god," as in apposition to "the land of Shinar,' and refers to two passages in Hosea (<a href="../../par/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="../../par/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>) in which "house" is, he alleges, used for "land." Irrespective of the fact that these two instances occur in highly wrought poetical passages, and that to argue from the sense of a word in poetry to its sense in plain prose is unsafe, there is no great plausibility in his interpretation of these passages. He regards the last clause as contrasted with the earlier: while the captives were brought "into the land of Shinar," the vessels were brought into "the treasure-house of his god" - an argument in which there is plausibility were there not the extreme awkwardness of using <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, "house," first in the extended sense of "country," and then in the restricted sense of "temple." The last clause is rather to be looked upon as rhetorical climax. <span class="accented">The land of Shinar</span> is used for Babylonia four times in the Book of Genesis, twice in the portion set apart as Jehovist by Canon Driver; the remaining instances are in ch. 14, both as the kingdom of Amraphel, which Canon Driver relegates to a special source. In the first instance (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>) it is the laud in which Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh were. In the next instance (ch. 11.) it is the place in which the Tower of Babel is built. The name is applied to Babylonia in <a href="../../par/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>. and <a href="../../par/zechariah/5-11.htm">Zechariah 5:11</a>. One of the titles which the kings of Babylon assumed regularly was "King of Sumir and Accad." From the connection of Shinar and Accad in <a href="../../par/genesis/10-20.htm">Genesis 10:20</a> we may deduce that "Shinar" is the Hebrew equivalent for "Sumir." It is not further removed from its original than is "Florence" from "Firenze," or "Leghorn" from "Livorno," or, to take a French instance, "Londres" from "London." The ingenious derivation of "Shiner" from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span>, "two," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;</span>, "a river," which, however, implies the identification of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, may have occasioned the modification, the more so as it was descriptive of Babylonia; hence the name "Aram-Naharaim," and its translation "Mesopotamia," applied to the tract between the Euphrates and the Tigris, north of Babylonia. In the Greek versions it becomes <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;</span>. It is omitted by Paulus Tellensis. <span class="accented">The treasure-house of his god.</span> The word rendered "god" here is the plural form, which is usually restricted to the true God, otherwise it is usually translated as "gods" To quote a few from many instances, Jephtha uses the word in the plural form of Chemosh (<a href="../../par/judges/11-24.htm">Judges 11:24</a>), Elijah applies it to Baal (<a href="../../par/1_kings/18-27.htm">1 Kings 18:27</a>), it is used of Nisroch (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>) In <a href="../../par/ezra/1-7.htm">Ezra 1:7</a> we have this same word translated plural in regard to the place in which Nebuchadnezzar had deposited the vessels of the house of God. In translating the verse before us, the Peshitta renders <span class="accented">path-coroh</span>, "his idol" This suits the translation of the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>. Paulus Tellensis renders it in the plural, "idols." The god in whose treasure-house the vessels of the house of God in Jerusalem were placed would necessarily be Merodach, whom Nebuchadnezzar worshipped, almost to the exclusion of any other. <span class="accented">The treasure-house of his god.</span> Temples had not many precious gifts bestowed upon them by their worshippers which were not taken by needy monarchs; nevertheless, the treasures of kingdoms were often deposited in a temple, to be under the protection of its god. The temple of Bel-Merodach in Babylon was a structure of great magnificence. Herodotus (1:181) gives a description, which is in the main confirmed by Strabe (16:5): "In the midst of the sacred area is a strong tower built a stadium in length and breadth; upon this tower is another raised, and another upon it, till there are eight towers. There is a winding ascent made about all the towers. In the middle of the ascent there is a resting-place, where are seats on which those ascending may sit and rest. In the last tower is a spacious shrine, and in it a huge couch beautifully bespread, and by its side is placed a table of gold. No statue has been set up here, nor does any mortal pass the night here." There are still remains of a structure which suits to some extent the description here given, but investigators are divided whether to regard Birs Nimroud or Babil as most properly representing this famous temple of Bel-Merodach. In the "Standard Inscription" Nebuchadnezzar appears to refer to this temple, which he calls E-temen-ana-ki," the house of heaven and earth." He says, among other matters concerning it, that he "stored up inside it silver and gold and precious stones, and placed there the treasure-house of his kingdom." This amply explains why the vessels of the house of God were taken to the temple of Bel-Merodach. The fact is mentioned that the vessels of the house of God were carried to Babylon, and, as a climax, "and he placed them in the treasure-house of his god." We know what befell  the statue of Dagon when the ark of God was placed in its presence, and the Jew, remembering this, relates awestruck the fact that these sacred vessels were placed in the temple of Bel. If no such disaster befell Bel-Merodach as befell Dagon, yet still the handwriting on the wall which appeared when these vessels were used to add to the splendour of the royal banquet, and which told the doom of the Chaldean monarchy, may be looked upon as the sequel to this act of what would necessarily appear to a Jew supreme sacrilege. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring <i>certain</i> of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king spoke unto Ash-penaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</span> The version of the LXX. here becomes important: "And the king spoke to Abiesdri, his own chief eunuch (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1ff3;</span>), to lead to him from the sons of the nobles of Israel, and from the seed royal, and from the choice ones, four young men, without blemish, of goodly appearance, and understanding in all wisdom, and educated, and prudent, and wise, and strong, so that they may be in the house of the king, and may be taught the letters and tongue of the Chaldees." The version of Theodotion is in closer accordance with the Massoretic text, only it inserts "captivity" where the LXX. had "nobles," and reads, "from the sons of the captivity of Israel." In this version the name of the chief of the eunuchs is the same as the Massoretic; the word rendered "princes" in the Authorized Version is transliterated <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. The rendering, "the seed of the kingdom," is more literal than that of the Authorized, "the king's seed" The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic text, save that, instead of "Ashpenaz," the name of the chief of the eunuchs is written "Aspaz," and the word translated "princes" (<span class="accented">parte-</span>mira) is transliterated <span class="accented">Parthouia</span>, which means literally "Parthians." Symmachus reads <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">The king spake unto Ashpenaz.</span> There is assumed here that there were a large number of Israelitish hostages who would be reckoned captives whenever the conquered state gave cause of suspicion to the regnant power in whose hands the hostages were, and they were possibly eunuchized. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar wished to use these hostages about the court, in order that, having tasted the pleasure and dignities of the magnificent court of Babylon, their influence would be exercised on their relatives to maintain them in fidelity. The phrase, "spake unto," has. in later Hebrew, the force of "command," especially when followed by an infinitive, as <a href="../../par/esther/1-17.htm">Esther 1:17</a>. As translated in the Authorized Version. the impression conveyed is that of consultation. The name "Ash-penaz" has caused much discussion. As it stands, it is not Assyrian or Babylonian. The form it has suggests a Persian etymology, and on this fact, along with other similar alleged facts, an argument against the authenticity of Daniel has been based. One derivation would make it <span class="accented">ashpa</span>, "a horse;" <span class="accented">nasa</span>, "a nose," "horse nose" - by no means an impossible personal name for a Persian or Median. In one or two cuneiform inscriptions of the Persian period the name occurs. Nothing can be built on this, as in the Septuagint the name is given as <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;</span>: in the Peshitta it becomes "<span class="accented">Ash-paz</span>," as we have mentioned above. It would be easily possible to derive" Ashpaz" from "Ashpenaz," or <span class="accented">vice versa</span>; but there seems no relation between <span class="accented">Abiesdri</span> and either. By some, as Hitzig, the name has been identified with "Ashkenaz" (<a href="../../par/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>), and that again derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, "the cord of the testicle," and has, a Sanskrit root, "to destroy," and therefore the name would simply be "eunuch." Over and above the general improbability that is always present in regard to etymologies which imply the word in question to be a hybrid word, there is the improbability that one eunuch would receive a name applicable to the whole class of which he was a member. The name, as it appears in the Septuagint, is, as we have said, totally unconnected with that in the Massoretic text, but both may have sprung from some common source. Thus the French word <span class="accented">eveque</span> has not a single letter in common with "bishop," yet both words are derived from <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The changes that a name might undergo in passing from any language, even a cognate one, into Hebrew wine very great; thus <span class="accented">Assur-bani-pal</span> became "Asnapper." Lenormant has endeavoured to recover the name in the present case. The process he has followed is the somewhat mechanical one of combining the two names, as if we were to strive to reach Asshur-bani-pal item a combination of "Asnapper" and "Sar-danapalus." He arrives at the name <span class="accented">Ash-ben-azur</span>, which is a possible Babylonian name. Professor Fuller has suggested <span class="accented">Aba-</span>(<span class="accented">i</span>)<span class="accented">-istar</span>, "the astronomer of the goddess Ishtar." The main objection to this is that it is drawn solely from the Septuagint Version. If we look at the tendency exhibited by the Hebrew equivalents of Babylonian names, we find that shortening was  one that was nearly invariably present, as <span class="accented">Asshur-akhi-iddin na</span> became <span class="accented">Esarhaddon</span>, and <span class="accented">Sin-akhi-irba</span> became <span class="accented">Sanherib.</span> The only exception to this shortening process which occurs to us is <span class="accented">Brodach</span> for <span class="accented">Marduk</span>, and even it is scarcely an exception. Next there is a tendency, which Hebrew shares with other languages, of suiting a foreign word to the genius of the language. Hence we find "Ashpenaz" has such a close resemblance to "Ashkenaz" of <a href="../../par/genesis/10-3.htm">Genesis 10:3</a>, and that "Abiesdri" is identical with the form "Abiezer" - the name of the father of Gideon - assumes in the Septuagint. Judging from "Asnapper," the name might even begin with <span class="accented">Asshur</span>, only that, as <span class="accented">Asshur</span> was the national god of the Ninevites, names which contained the name of that divinity are rare in Babylon. The first element in the word might not impossibly be <span class="accented">ablu</span>, "son." The final element seems certainly to have been <span class="accented">ezer</span> or <span class="accented">utzur.</span> As to the office he tided in the court of Nebuchadnezzar, "the master of eunuchs," the name of the office in the text is <span class="accented">Rab-Sarisim</span>, which occurs in a slightly different form in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>, along with <span class="accented">Rab-Shakeh</span>, as if it were a proper name. From the fact that persons thus mutilated were employed in Eastern courts, the word became equivalent to "officer;" hence we find Petiphar is called <span class="accented">saris</span>, or "eunuch;" yet he had a wife. It therefore may be doubted whether Daniel and his companions are to be understood as placed in that condition. The title here given - <span class="accented">Rab-Sarisim - becomes Sar-Sarisim</span> in vers. 7 and 10, <span class="accented">Sat</span> being the Hebrew equivalent of the more Babylonian <span class="accented">Rab.</span> It is also Aramaic. <span class="accented">That he should bring certain of the children of Israel</span>, <span class="accented">and of the king's seed</span>, <span class="accented">and of the princes.</span> It may be doubted at first sight whether these may not be separate classes - a view that seems to have been taken by most of the old translators, or whether the first class, "the children of Israel," does not include the two classes that follow. The rendering <span class="accented">part'mim</span>, as "Parthians," adopted by Symmachus and the Peshitta, would make a contrast between "the children of Israel" and "the Parthians." That, however, is utterly unlikely. Were that translation the true one, a strong argument could be advanced for the late origin of Daniel. The fact that the text before Symmachus and the Peshitta translator admitted of that translation shows how far the tendency to modify the text into suitability with the knowledge of the scribe had gone, and therefore how little weight ought to be given to lateness of individual words. According to the LXX. and Theodotion, there is a word awanting in the first clause; the Septuagint translator would supply "nobles" (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) "from the nobles of Israel." Theodotion renders, "from the sons of the Captivity of Israel." If the sentence ran <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>, one might understand how it could be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>; the natural phrase for this is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>, but that would not explain the LXX. rendering. The name "Israel" is the covenant name of the whole nation, equally applicable to the southern and to the northern kingdoms. All the more so that the captivity of Judah contained members of three other tribes besides that of Judah, namely, those of Benjamin and Simeon an l Levi. Further, Josiah seems to have extended the bounds of the Davidic kingdom to embrace the remnant of the ten tribes (<a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6, 9</a>), therefore his sons would claim the same boundaries, and therefore hostages might be taken by Nebuchadnezzar from them to Babylon. <span class="accented">And of the king's seed and of the princes.</span> The two "ands" might be rendered "both... and," or "alike ... and." The king's seed means, literally, "the seed of the kingdom," as it is translated by Theodotion. The phrase, "children of the kingdom," is applied by our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>) to all the Jews, and in <a href="../../par/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a> to the members of the true Israel - perhaps with a latent reference to the children of the true King thus in captivity to the beggarly elements of this world, compelled to stand as servants in the court of Mammon, of which Nebuchadnezzar may well be the type. The word <span class="accented">partemim</span> is one which has caused difficulty; it only occurs here, and twice in Esther (<a href="../../par/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3</a>; <a href="../../par/esther/6-9.htm">Esther 6:9</a>). In these passages it is rendered by the Peshitta as here, <span class="accented">Parthouia</span>, "Parthians." It would seem that the Septuagint translator had before him, not <span class="accented">partemin</span>, but <span class="accented">bahureem</span>, connecting it with <span class="accented">yeladeem</span>," children" (youths), the opening word of the succeeding vers,., In Esther the word <span class="accented">part&deg;mim</span> is applied to a special class of nobles among the Persians, and certainly was not applied to the princes of Judah. Theodotion does not understand what it means, and so transliterates it <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>. Symmachus and the Peshitta make it "Parthians;" the Targum on Esther makes the same blunder. The LXX. Version of Esther renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, as if it were connected with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>. It certainly has Zend (<span class="accented">frathema</span>) and Pehlevi (<span class="accented">pardun</span>) congeners, so it may have come over from Aryan sources into the Babylonian. Equally certainly it has disappeared from Aramaic Eastern and Western. If <span class="accented">partemim</span> is to be held as part of the original text, it must belong to a period before the Greek domination, as the meaning of the word had disappeared by that time. It might, on the other hand, have been a word in the Babylonian  court, or, again, a copyist might have inserted it as a more known word than that originally in the text. This latter, we think, is the probable solution. If the division of the verses had in the Massoretic become deranged, then <span class="accented">bahureem</span> would be unintelligible, standing, as it would, at the end of the verse. In Egypt this derangement did not take place, and hence <span class="accented">bahureem</span> was retained. <span class="accented">Children in whom was no blemish.</span> There is no limit to the age implied in <span class="accented">yeled</span>, the word the plural of which is translated "children;" thus to young counsellors who had been brought up with Rehoboam are called <span class="accented">yeladeem.</span> As they had been brought up with Rehoboam, they were of the same age with him, yet he was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne. Joseph is called <span class="accented">yeled</span> when he was at least seventeen, and Ishmael when he was probably sixteen. Benjamin is called <span class="accented">yeled</span> when he was nearly, if not quite, thirty years old; it is said of him immediately before he went down to Egypt, and then he was the father of ten sons. It is used also of new-born infants (<a href="../../par/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>). When we look at the various qualifications they were to possess <span class="accented">- skilful in all wisdom</span>, <span class="accented">cunning in knowledge</span>, <span class="accented">understanding science -</span> sixteen to eighteen seems the lowest limit we can set. Aben Ezra comes to the conclusion that they were fourteen when they came to Babylon; that, however, even when all allowance is made for the precocity of warm climates, seems too low. On the whole, we may say that Daniel, when he was taken to Babylon, was the same age as Joseph when he went down into Egypt. The Septuagint rendering (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) supports our view. We may note that this command to Ashpenaz was in all likelihood given at Jerusalem. <span class="accented">In whom was no blemish</span>, <span class="accented">but well-secured.</span> If we may judge of the taste of the Babylonians and Assyrians from the sculptures that have come down to us, they had a high standard of personal appearance - especially fine in appearance are the eunuchs that stand before the king. The word <span class="accented">moom</span>, "blemish," is used of the priesthood; presence of a "blemish" excluded from the priesthood (<a href="../../par/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17</a>). It is used of Absalom (<a href="../../par/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>); it is equivalent in meaning to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which not impossibly was derived from some early form of this word; <span class="accented">tovay mar'eh</span>," goodly in appearance," almost identical with our colloquial "good-looking." <span class="accented">Skilful in all wisdom.</span> The word "wisdom" has, in general, a somewhat technical meaning in Hebrew, "skill in interpreting riddles and framing proverbs." It became widened in meaning in certain cases, as we see in the description of wisdom in the beginning of Proverbs and <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/job/28.htm">Job 28</a>. Yet wider is the sphere given to it in Ecclesiasticus and the Book of Wisdom. The word translated "skilful," <span class="accented">maskileem</span>, means, in the first instance, "attending to;" then, the result of this attention, especially when followed by the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span>, "in," The LXX. suits this, "skilled in all wisdom." Theodotion renders, "understanding (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) in all wisdom." Professor Bevan would render <span class="accented">maskil</span>, "intelligent;" Hitzig adopts Luther's <span class="accented">einsichtig in allerlei Wissenschaft</span>, "intelligent in every kind of science," adding, "that is, they would be were they placed in suitable circumstances." He objects to De Wette rendering "experienced," as unsuitable to boys. <span class="accented">Cunning in knowledge</span>; literally, <span class="accented">knowing knowledge.</span> The distinction is here between the faculty of intelligence and the actual acquirements. It might be rendered "intelligent and well-educated" - a view that is supported by the Septuagint rendering (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>)<span class="accented">. Understanding science</span>; "discriminating knowledge," as it is rendered in Theodotion. The Septuagint translator had another text before him; instead of reading <span class="accented">mebine madda</span>, he had before him <span class="accented">mebinim yod'eem</span>, that is to say, he divided the letters differently, so that he read it along with <span class="accented">mebine</span>, and had <span class="accented">a yod</span> inserted after it, not as connected, but as separate. The word <span class="accented">madda</span> <span class="accented">is</span> late, found in Chronicles and Ecclesiastes, and as Aramaic well known; the change in the Septuagint must have been due to a different reading. The fact that <span class="accented">madda</span> <span class="accented">is</span> late, and was <span class="accented">not</span> in the Septuagint text, throws a suspicion on all the late words in Daniel, as all of them may be due to the same modernizing tendency. The phrase, according to the Septuagint reading, may be rendered, "having good powers of discrimination and acquisition." <span class="accented">And such as had the ability in them to stand in the king's palace.</span> The word used for "ability" (<span class="accented">koh</span>) usually means "physical strength," as of Samson (<a href="../../par/judges/16-6.htm">Judges 16:6</a>), applied to animals as of the unicorn (wild ox) (<a href="../../par/job/39-11.htm">Job 39:11</a>). Here, however, it refers rather to mental capacity. The idea is that those should be chosen who showed signs of future ability, and therefore afforded a probability that they would be of use in the royal council-chamber. The translator of the Septuagint Version puts a point after <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, and unites the two following clauses under it. <span class="accented">And whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans</span>. The LXX. renders, "to teach them letters and the Chaldean dialect." There were three tongues used in Babylon. There was the Aramaic of ordinary business and diplomacy, called in <a href="../../par/2_kings/18-26.htm">2 Kings 18:26</a> "the Syrian language," and in this book (ch. Daniel 2:4) "Syriack." This was commonly understood, as is shown by the fact that tablets have been found inscribed in Assyrian, but having a docquet behind in Aramaic, telling the contents. Next there was the Assyrian, a Shemitic tongue, cognate with Hebrew, though further removed from it than Aramaic is. This is the language of historic and legal documents, much as Norman French was for long the language of our Acts of Parliament, while the people spoke a tongue not far removed from our modern English. The system of writing was cumbrous in the highest degree, the same sign standing for several different words, and the same word represented by several different signs. As a spoken language &#8212; if it ever were a spoken tongue &#8212; it was cumbrous also. It was eminently a monumental tongue. Lastly, there was Accadian, the sacred tongue, a language belonging to a different class from the Aramaic and Assyrian. In it the great bulk of the magical formulae and ritual directions of Babylon and Nineveh were written. In the huge library of Asshurbanipal, now in the British Museum, a large portion is composed of translations of those Accadian texts. A number of syllabaries have also been found, which enable scholars to investigate this antique tongue. It seems not impossible that Accadian was meant by the learning (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">sepher</span>, "book") and tongue of the Chaldeans. Their learning involved some astronomy, a great deal of astrology, and not a little magic, incantations, interpretations of dreams and omens. We ourselves, though so far removed both geographically and chronologically from them, feel the effects of their ideas, and enjoy some of the results of their knowledge. We cannot tell whether the Babylonians were the earliest to fix the course of the sun, moon, and planets. At all events, they made observations on the basis of these discoveries; and our week, with its Sunday and Monday, conveys to us still the fact that the Babylonians believed the planets to be seven; the planets strictly so called were associated with deities similar in attributes to those associated with them by the Latin and Teutonic peoples, and the same days were sacred to them in Babylonia and Germany. <span class="accented">The Chaldeans</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, <span class="accented">Kasdeem</span>, of the Bible, do not seem to have been originally inhabitants of Babylon. They formed a cluster of clans to the south-west of Babylon, who invaded Babylonia, and occasionally secured the supremacy in the city. The Assyrians had frequent encounters with them, and carried on against them many prolonged wars. The name in the Assyrian monuments is most frequently <span class="accented">Kaldu</span>, from which the Greek <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> comes. It is doubtful whether there is a form <span class="accented">Kassatu</span> to explain the Hebrew term. In the days of Nabo-polassar, the Chaldeans being supreme in Babylonia, all the inhabitants of that province may have been called Chaldeans. Latterly there was a restricted use of the term, due to the great attention paid in Babylonia to astrology. It is doubtful whether this restricted use of the word occurred in the genuine Daniel, from which our canonical Daniel has sprung. Certainly Daniel, and those hostages selected with him, were to be educated so as to become member's of this sacred college of augurs and astrologers.

The only thing to be noticed in the LXX. Version of this verse is the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken to mean "give a portion" - a meaning which seems to be implied in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>), hence the translation <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. Further, the translator must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> as in <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-29.htm">2 Kings 25:29</a>. The mysterious <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (<span class="accented">path-bag</span>), translated "meat," has caused differences of rendering. The Syriac Peshitta transfers it. Professor Bevan speaks as if it were common in Syriac, but Castell gives no reference beyond Daniel. (Brockei-mann adds, Ephrem Syrus, Isaac Antiochenus, Bar Hebraeus). It is to be observed that the Syriac form of the word has <span class="accented">teth</span>, not <span class="accented">tan</span>, for the second radical. This is a change that would not likely take place had the Hebrew form been the original, whereas from the fact that <span class="accented">path</span> means in Hebrew "a portion," if the Hebrew were derived from the Syriac the change would be intelligible. It is confounded in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-26.htm">Daniel 11:26</a> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">pathura</span>), "a table." It seems not improbable that both the LXX. and Theodotion read <span class="accented">pathura.</span> The word <span class="accented">path-bag</span> does not seem to have been known in Palestine; it does not occur in Chaldee, but does in Syriac. This is intelligible if the chapter before us is condensation from a Syriac original rendered into Hebrew: the word <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, being unintelligible, is transferred. The etymology of the word is alleged to be Persian, but on this assumption it is a matter of dispute what that etymology is. One derivation is from <span class="accented">pad</span> or fad, "father" or "prince," or <span class="accented">pat</span> or <span class="accented">fat</span>, idol,' and <span class="accented">bag</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;</span>), food; another is from <span class="accented">pati-bhagu</span>, "a portion." The question is complicated by the fact that in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> we have in the K'tbib <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span> (bag), meaning "food." In that case <span class="accented">path-bag</span> would mean "a portion of food." The reading of the K'thib is not supported by the versions. In Daniel the word simply means "food," such as was supplied to the king's table. We see in the slabs from the palace of  Kou-youn-jik the nature of a royal feast. Animal food predominated. We cannot avoid referring to a singular argumentative axiom implied in all the <span class="accented">discussions</span> on Daniel. Critics seem to think that when they prove that certain words in Daniel are Persian, they thus prove Daniel was written nearly a couple of centuries after the Persian domination had disappeared. <span class="accented">Of the wine which he drank.</span> It is to be noted that there is a restriction. The wine supplied was the wine which the king drank - wine of which an oblation had been offered to idols. In thus bringing up hostages at his own table, Nebuchadnezzar was following a practice which has continued down to our own day. The son of Theodore of Magdala was brought up at the court of our queen. It was the regular practice, as we know, in Imperial Rome. Sennacherib speaks of Belibus, whom he made deputy-king in Babylon, as brought up "as a little dog at his table" (Bellino Cylinder, Sehrader, vol. 2. p. 32, Engl, trans.). <span class="accented">So nourishing them three years.</span> This was the period during which the education of a Persian youth was continued. It is probable, as we have seen, that these youths were about sixteen or seventeen. At the end of three years they would still be very young. The grammatical connection of the word <span class="accented">legaddelam is</span> somewhat singular. The Septuagint reading probably had the first word in this verse in the infinitive also. This is more grammatical, as it brings the whole under the regimen of the opening clause of ver. 3. The force of the word before us is represented in "bringing up." The verb in its simple form means "to be strong," "to be great," hence in the intensive form before us, "to make great," "to bring up." <span class="accented">That at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span> "Standing before the king" means usually becoming members of the council of the monarch, but in the present instance this does not seem to be the meaning. They were to be presented before the king, and in his presence they were to be examined. They were, then, possibly to be admitted into the college of astrologers and soothsayers, but only in lowly grade. Irrespective of the fact that they would at the latest be twenty or twenty-one when this season of education was over, an(t, even making all allowance for Eastern precocity, this is too young an age for being a member of a royal privy council. But the next chapter relates an event which appears to be the occasion when they stood before the king, for they were not summoned with the wise men to the king's presence to interpret his dream. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-6.htm">Daniel 1:6</a></div><div class="verse">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</span>. The versions present no difficulty here, only the Septuagint adds a clause to bring this verse into harm(my with ver. 3: the Septuagint rendering is, "And there were of the race of the sons of Israel that came from Judaea, Daniel, Ananias, Mishael, and Azarias." That they were of "the children of Judah" seems to exclude the possibility of these four belonging to any other tribe, all the more that the whole children of Israel are spoken of in the third verse. The version which we find in the Septuagint leaves the matter tree. At the same time, the addition is one that is so naturally suggested by the third verse, that we cannot claim that the reading of the Septuagint is the more probable. The names of the four companions all occur elsewhere, and, as is usual with Hebrew names, all are significant. Daniel means either "Judge of God" or "God my Judge." As Hebrew grammar is now, the latter is the meaning; but there was an older form of the construct state, which appears in proper names like "Gabriel," which makes it probable that "Judge of God" or "Divine Judge" is the meaning intended to be conveyed. This meaning is in,plied in the story of Susanna and the eiders. David's son by Abigail the Carmelitess is called Daniel in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>. In the case of the son of David, the name would probably indicate the confidence in God which his father felt, rather than any description of the son. In <a href="../../par/ezra/8-2.htm">Ezra 8:2</a> a Daniel is mentioned who seems to be a son of Ithamar. We say "<span class="accented">seems</span> to <span class="accented">be</span>," because it is evident that there is an omission somewhere of a name; if the omission has taken place before <span class="accented">m'bne Phinhas</span>, then Daniel becomes the representative of the sons of David, and Hattush the representative of the <span class="accented">sons</span> of Pabath. In <a href="../../par/nehemiah/10-6.htm">Nehemiah 10:6</a> in the number of the priests who sealed the covenant, is a "Daniel" named, who may be the same as the preceding. In the LXX. version of the apocryphal additions to Daniel, the prophet is identified with the priest. The first verse in the story of Bel and the Dragon is, "There was a certain man, a priest, whose name was Daniel, the son of Abal, the familiar friend of the King of Babylon." There is nothing to make it certain, it we do not take the phrase here in its absolute sense, that Daniel did not belong to the family of Aaron; if we take the phrase in its restricted sense, then the balance of probability is that  he was a member of the Davidic family. Hananiah (<span class="accented">Hananyah</span>; Greek, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>: the Hebrew form, as in the case of other names with the same termination, is sometimes lengthened to <span class="accented">Hananyahu</span>). The name means "The Lord Jehovah is gracious." This name is one of the most common in the Bible. Sometimes it is reversed, and becomes <span class="accented">Jehohanan</span> or <span class="accented">Johanan</span>, and hence "John." The earliest is the head of the sixteenth of the twenty-four courses into which David divided the Hemanites (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/25-4.htm">2 Chronicles 25:4</a>). In the reign of Uzziah there appears one as a chief captain (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-11.htm">2 Chronicles 26:11</a>). In Jeremiah there are three; most prominent, however, is the false prophet who declared that Jeconiah and all his fellow-captives would be brought back in the space of two years (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/28-15.htm">Jeremiah 28:15</a>). One of the ancestors of our Lord, called in Luke (<a href="../../par/luke/3-27.htm">Luke 3:27</a>) Joanna, the son of Rhess, grandson of Zerubbabel, is called in <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/3-19.htm">1 Chronicles 3:19</a> Hananiah, and reckoned a son of Zerubbabel. In the Book of Nehemiah there are several persons spoken of as bearing this name, not impossibly as many as six. In New Testament times it was still common: Ananias the husband of Sapphira (<a href="../../par/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1</a>); the devout Jew of Damascus, sent to Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>); the high priest in the time of Paul (<a href="../../par/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>). Unlike Hananiah, Mishael is one of the rarer names It occurs as the name of one of the sons of Uzziel, the uncle of Moses and Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/6-22.htm">Exodus 6:22</a>; <a href="../../par/leviticus/10-4.htm">Leviticus 10:4</a>), and again as one who stood at Ezra's left hand when he read the Law (<a href="../../par/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4</a>). There is some question as to the meaning of the name. Two interpretations have been suggested; the simplest and most direct is, "Who is what God is;" the other is, "Who is like God." The objection to the first is that the contracted relative is employed, which does not elsewhere appear in this book. This, however, is not insuperable, as the contracted form of the relative was in common use in the northern kingdom, and might, therefore, appear in a name; the objection to the second is that a letter is omitted, but such omissions continually occur. Hitzig refers to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, as a case in point. Azariah, "Jehovah is Helper," is, like Hananiah, a very common name throughout Jewish history It is the name by which Uzziah is called in <a href="../../par/2_kings/14-21.htm">2 Kings 14:21</a>: 15:1, 7, 8, 17 (called Uzziah in vers. 13, 30, as also in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>.) It is the name of four high priests: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> one (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-10.htm">1 Chronicles 6:10</a>)during the reign of Solomon, the grandson of Zadok; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the high priest during the reign of Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-11.htm">1 Chronicles 6:11</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> high priest during the reign of his namesake Azariah or Uzziah King of Judah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/26-17.htm">2 Chronicles 26:17-20</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> high priest in the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/31-10.htm">2 Chronicles 31:10-14</a>). There is also a prophet of this name (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/15-1.htm">2 Chronicles 15:1</a>) in the days of Asa King of Judah. While this name is so common before the Captivity, it is not so common after it, though there is a captain of the army of Judas Maccabteus called "Azarias." While all the names contain the name of God, either in the covenant form "Jehovah" or the common form "el," yet there is nothing in the names to suggest the history before us. Jewish tradition made them out to be of the royal family; of this there is no certainty. In the time of Jerome it was held they were eunuchs, and thus the prophecy in Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/39-7.htm">Isaiah 39:7</a>) was fulfilled. Others have held that <a href="../../par/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3</a>, "Let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree," had a reference to those captives. So far, however, as we know, eunuchs might be attendants of Assyrian and Babylonian monarchs might bear the state umbrella over their heads, might give the cup to them, might arrange their couch for them, or announce their approach to the harem, but were not their councillors or warriors. That was left for the days of the Byzantine Empire, when the eunuch Narses retained Italy for the empire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-7.htm">Daniel 1:7</a></div><div class="verse">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel <i>the name</i> of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names; for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego</span>. The only thing to be noted in regard to the versions is that, with the exception of the Peshitta, all of them identify the name of Daniel with that of the last King of Babylon. Both are called <span class="accented">Baltasar</span> or <span class="accented">Baltassar</span> in the Vulgate, the LXX., and Theodotion. The difference made in the Peshitta is not the same as that in the Hebrew; the prophet is called Beletshazzar, and the king Belit-shazzar. This would indicate something wrong. The Greek versions render Abed-nego <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>, which also the Vulgate has. This habit of changing the names of those who entered their service prevailed among Eastern potentates. Joseph became <span class="accented">Zaph-nath-paaneah</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>). Not only did those about the court receive new names, but, not infrequently, subject monarchs, as token of subjection, were newly named, as Jehoiakim, who had formerly been Eliakim. Professor Fuller mentions the case of the Egyptian monarch Psammetik II., whose name as subject of Asshur-bani-pal was <span class="accented">Nabo-sezib-ani.</span> Not only so, but monarchs of their own will changed their names with changed circumstances; thus Pal in Babylon is Tiglath-pileser in Nineveh. Still in modern times this is continued in the head  of Roman Catholic Christendom, who has for the last twelve centuries always assumed another than his original name on ascending the papalthrone. With members of a monarch's court this is easily intelligible. The desire was to have names of good omen; a foreign name might either be meaningless or suggest anything but thoughts full of good omen. In considering these names, there are certain preliminary facts we must bear in mind. In the first place, there is a great probability that all the names had a Divine element in them, that is, contained as an element the name of a Babylonian god. The great mass of the names of Baby-Ionian and Assyrian officials had this. Next, it is by no means improbable that, at the hands of the Jewish scribes, the names have sustained some considerable change, more especially as regards the Divine element. The Jewish scribe had few scruples as to altering a name when there was anything in it to hurt his sensibilities. It is horrible to him that Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses the great lawgiver, should be the originator of the false temple at Dan, and so he inserts a <span class="accented">nun</span>, and changes <span class="accented">Moshe</span>, "Moses," into "Manasseh." The scribe that copied out 2 Samuel, coming to the name of Jerubbaal, cannot endure to chronicle the fact that a judge in Israel ever bore the name of the abomination of the Zidonians as part of his name, and altered it to Jerubesheth. So we have in the same book Ishbosheth for Ethbaal, and Mephibosheth for Meribbaal. With a foreign potentate it is different; but in the case of a Jew there always was a tendency to blink such an awkward fact as bearing a name with heathen elements, by a slight change. The name given to Daniel is, in the Massoretic text, Belteshazzar. From the fact that in the Septuagint, Theodotion, and the Vulgate, we have the king Belshazzar and Daniel, as Babylonian magician, called by the same name," Baltasar," and when in the Peshitta, the difference is very slight, and not always maintained, we, for our part, are strongly inclined to believe both names to have been the same. Professor Bevan ('The Book of Daniel,' 40) is quite sure that the author did not understand the meaning of the name given to Daniel. He (Professor Bevan) derives the name from <span class="accented">Balat-zu-utzur</span>, "Protect thou his life." Professor Fuller, with as great plausibility, makes it <span class="accented">Bilat-sarra-utzur</span>, "Beltis protects the crown." If that be the true derivation, then Nebuchadnezzar could quite correctly say that he was called after the name of his god. Still more accurate would this statement be if the name were Belshazzar. But an uneasy suspicion crosses our mind. Does the author of Daniel ever attribute to Nebuchadnezzar the words on which Professor Bevan grounds his charge? The words are not in the Septuagint. Thus Professor Bevan - never admitting the possibility of the name Belteshazzar having been modified from something else, although the evidence of the versions points most distinctly to that, and although he candidly admits it to have taken place in regard to Abed-nego - assumes an etymology for it, as if it were the only possible one, which it is not; and on the ground of this etymology, and on the assumption that certain words were in the original text of Daniel, which are yet not in the Septuagint, he concludes that the author of Daniel did not know the meaning of the name he had given to his hero. Surely this is special pleading. If there has been any tampering with the name or modification of it, then Professor Bevan's assumption falls to the ground, and his argument with it; but there seems every probability that there has been such modification, and the effect of such modification would be to deface the name of the heathen divinity in the name if there were such. Further, if Professor Fuller's etymology may be maintained, again Professor Bevan's assumption falls to the ground. These two arguments do not conflict. A Jewish scribe, ignorant of ancient Assyrian, might easily introduce a modification which, despite his intention, did not remove all heathen divinity from the name, only changed the divinity. If the original text of Daniel did not contain the phrase in the fourth chapter, "according to the name of my god," then again Professor Bevan's assumption is proved groundless, and his argument without value. The phrase in question is not in the Septuagint, and therefore it is, to say the least, suspicious. It has no such intimate connection with the context as to show it part of the text; it is just such a phrase as would be put on the margin as a gloss, and get into the text by blunder of a copyist. It may be observed that Professor Bevan merely follows Schrader, alike in his derivation and deduction; but he, not Schrader, had before him continually the Septuagint version of Daniel, and he, not Schrader, is commentator on Daniel. <span class="accented">And to Hananiah of Shadrach.</span> This name is explained by Dr. Delitzsch as being a modified transliteration of <span class="accented">Shudur-aku</span>, "the command of Aku" (the moon-deity). With this Schrader agrees. There is always the possibility of the name having undergone a change. On the other hand, as the name of the deity, <span class="accented">Aku</span>, does not appear in Scripture, the Puritanic scribe might be unaware of its presence here. <span class="accented">And to Mishael of Meshach.</span> This name has caused  great difficulty; it is consonantally identical with <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, "Hesheeh," the name of one of the sons of Japhet. Dr. Delitzsch would render it <span class="accented">Me-sa-aku</span>, "Who is as Aku." Schrader's objections to this are, that in the first place the Babylonian form would be <span class="accented">Mamm-ki-Aku.</span> And next, that there would not likely be a simple translation of the Hebrew name into Assyrian, but rather the giving a new name altogether. This second objection is valueless, for Pharaoh-Necho did not wholly change the name of Eliakim when he set him on the throne; since <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> may be regarded as the equivalent of <span class="accented">El.</span> The fact that "Meshach" is so like "Mcshech" points to intentional modification, and, therefore, to the presence in the name of the designation of a Babylonian god likely to be known to the Jews, such as Merodach, whose name was known to the Jews by its occurrence in the names Evil-Merodach and Merodach-Baladan, and actually as a divinity in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-2.htm">Jeremiah 50:2</a>. Such is Lenormant's hypothesis ('La Divination,' p. 178). which would render it <span class="accented">Misa-Mero-dash</span>, "Who is as Merodach" <span class="accented">-</span> a suggestion certainly open to Schrader's first objection. <span class="accented">And to Azariah of Abed-nego.</span> It has long been recognized that this name is a modification of <span class="accented">Abed-Nebo.</span> This identification is rendered all the more probable, that in New Hebrew and Aramaic <span class="accented">Naga</span> meant the planet "Venus," that is, "Nebo" The consonants are correct for this, but the vocalization is purposely wrong, in order to avoid the heathen name. If the author of Daniel was an obscure Jew, living in Palestine during the days of Epiphanes, whoa the influence of Babylon had disappeared, and its language had ceased to be studied, is it not strange that he should devise names which so accurately represent those that were in Babylon? One has only to read the Book of Judith, in all likelihood the product of the Epiphanes period (Konig, 'Einlcitung,' 480), to see the wild work that Palestinian Jews of that time made of Babylonian names. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-8.htm">Daniel 1:8</a></div><div class="verse">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wins which he drank, therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself</span>. The Septuagint renders the first clause somewhat paraphrastically, "Daniel desired in his heart," led possibly to this by the more limited meaning assigned to "heart" in the psychology of ordinary Greek speech. Theodotion is, as usual, in close harmony with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta, instead of "heart," has <span class="accented">r'ina</span>, "mind." As before noticed, the G reek versions here render <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d1;&#x5d2;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. Jerome renders it <span class="accented">mensa</span> In the Syriac the word is present, as we before said. We have above indicated that it is possible that the original word was not <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, but <span class="accented">pathura.</span> In regard to the Massoretic text as compared with the Greek and Latin versions, it seems certain that <span class="accented">path-bag</span>, if belonging to the text, was only understood in the East - a phenomenon that would be intelligible if this chapter be a condensation and translation of an original Aramaic text, especially if the Aramaic were Eastern, not Western. An ancient feast had always the nature of a sacrifice. It was the case with the Jews: thus in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11, 12</a>, directions are given for sacrificing in the place which the Lord should choose, and they and all their household rejoicing. But if the place chosen were too far, then permission was given them to eat flesh, only they were to be careful not to eat with the blood. It was the characteristic of the classic nations all through their whole history, that the feast should be consecrated by the offering of something of it to the Deity. The immense probability was that this was the case also among the Babylonians. It may be that this consecration of the feast arose from the same justifiable religious feeling which leads us to ask a blessing on our meals. The habit of the African Church to celebrate the Lord's Supper at every supper, was probably connected with this offering to God of what the guests were about to partake. This fact, that every feast had the character of a sacrifice, might easily make these Hebrew youths refuse the royal dainties. So far as animal food was concerned, the careful directions as to not eating with blood made partaking of the feasts of the Babylonian monarch peculiarly liable to bring on them defilement. The fact that Evil-Merodach provided Jeconiah with a portion from his table, and that Jeconiah did not refuse it, does not necessarily militate against the early date of Daniel. Jeconiah probably was not as conscientious as those youths, and, on the other hand, Daniel's influence by this time may have arranged some consideration for Jewish scruples. It is certain that in 2 Maccabees 5:27 Judas and his brethren are represented as living in the mountains on herbs, after the manner of beasts, that they might not be defiled; but as there is nothing parallel to this in 1 Maccabees, we may dismiss the statement as probably untrue. So the whole idea of this action on the part of Judas and his nine companions may have arisen from the case recorded before us. It has all the look of a rhetorical addition to the narrative, and the differences of the circumstances were not such as would strike a rhetorical scribe; but as this  abstinence appeared to add to the sanctity of these four Hebrew youths, would it not add to the sanctity of Judas also? 'In the Assyrian feasts the guests do not seem to have sat at one long table or several long tables, as is usual with us. The guests were divided into sets of four, and had provisions served to them, and it is to be observed that the youths before us would have exactly occupied one of those tables. The word used for "defile" (<span class="accented">ga'al</span>) occurs in Isaiah, Lamentations, Zephaniah, Malachi, Ezra, and Nehemiah. It is an Exilic and post-Exilic word mainly; the old priestly word <span class="accented">lama</span> had not disappeared - it is used in Haggai. It is to be observed that there is nothing about defilement in the Peshitta; it is not impossible that the word is a later addition, only its presence both in Theodotion and the Septuagint renders the omission improbable. There is nothing in the passage here which makes it necessary for us to maintain that the principle of action followed by those youths was one which was generally acknowledged to be incumbent on all Jews. It may simply have been that, feeling the critical condition in which they were placed, it was well for them to erect a hedge about the Law. There may even have been an excess of scrupulosity which is in perfect dramatic suitability to the age of the youths. Such abstinence may well have occasioned the regular abstinence of the Essenes, but this state-merit concerning Daniel and his friends can scarcely have originated from the Essene dietary. It has been noted, as a proof of Daniel's courtesy and docility, that he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. But to have refused the food provided by the king might have been construed as an insult to the king, and anything of that sort had swift and severe punishment meted out to it. Daniel's request was simply due to the necessities of the situation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a></div><div class="verse">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span> The word here translated "tender love" really means "bowels," and then "mercy" or "compassion." Hence the Apostle Paul (<a href="../../par/philippians/2-1.htm">Philippians 2:1</a>) combines the two meanings, "If there be any bowels and mercies." The Revised Version is here to be preferred, "favour and compassion,' as the Authorized exaggerates the affection the prince of the eunuchs had for Daniel. The versions in this verse do not afford any marked variations. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Lord," usually employed to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, Jehovah, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>). It is not impossible that the original reading may have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, though it is to be admitted not likely. <span class="accented">Rahameem</span> is translated <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>," favour," in the Septuagint, which is a weak rendering; Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, which may be regarded as practically equivalent to our Revised Version. While the third verse speaks of the "chief" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>) of the eunuchs, a Babylonian and Assyrian title, the more usual Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> replaces it in this verse and in that which precedes it. From this root the Assyrian and Babylonian word for "king," <span class="accented">sat</span> or <span class="accented">sarru</span>, was derived, while <span class="accented">tab</span> fell on evil days. Among the later Jews it became equivalent to mr doctors of divinity. Before the word for "God" (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>) there is the article. So far as the form stands, it might be plural, and therefore be capable of being translated "the gods," but the verb being singular renders that translation impossible. The affection with which the chief of the eunuchs regarded Daniel is notified to us as the result of God's goodness, who had thus given him favour in the eyes of him set over him. The Hebrew never failed to recognize, in his devouter moments, that the hearts of all men are in the hands of God; that by him kings reign and princes decree wisdom.

It is to be noted that the Septuagint here has two renderings, probably a case of "doublet." The first <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> may refer to the mental confusion or sadness that they might be in if on account of their poor nourishment they were unable to answer the king's questions; the second, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>, "weak," may refer to the body: <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> Theodotion's rendering, which may be rendered "scowling" (it is used along with <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Plato, 'Syrup.'). The Peshitta has <span class="accented">m'karan</span>, "ashamed;" that they would feel shame were they much inferior in looks or acquirements to their neighbours would be natural. The intimate connection between food and good looks and good mental qualities is well known as one much held, especially in ancient days. <span class="accented">Than the children of your sort.

The only difficulty in this is that the name may have another derivation. The real meaning of the word in this connection is "a circle;" hence then a revolution of the heavens.

The other, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geereem</span>): this is still more like the Massoretic reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5db;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">geelkem</span>). The Massoretic is possibly the reading from which the other two have sprung; if so, it is clear that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> has not in this sense been known to either of the two Egyptian translators. It is not Targumic, for Levy has it not in his Lexicon. Professor Bevan says it is Aramaic and Arabic. This, then, is a case where the Aramaic original shines through; the chief of the eunuchs would naturally speak in Aramaic. <span class="accented">Then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</span> Here again is a word which Professor Bevan declares is late, the word here translated "make me endanger <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">yehigyabetem</span>)." There is no difficulty as to the reading in the versions, save that the Septuagint reads the first person singular instead of the second person plural, in other words, <span class="accented">vehiyyabti</span>, "and I shall endanger," and "my neck," reading, instead of "my head," possibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tzavvari</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">maphraqti</span>), the latter reading due to the <span class="accented">mere</span>, the sign of the second person plural being transferred to the following word. It may certainly have been a paraphrase, but the phrase as it stands in the Massoretic seems awkward. <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan brings forward this word as Aramaic, and a proof of the lateness of Daniel. If we are correct, it is a case where the Aramaic of the original shines through. The word indubitably occurs in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>. As counsel for the prosecution, Professor Bevan must get rid of this awkward fact. Cornill, one of his colleagues in the case against Daniel, suggests that another word should be read in Ezekiel, and <span class="accented">Professor</span> Bevan agrees, but differs as to the word. There is no indication in any of the versions that there is any uncertainty as to the reading in Ezekiel. It is a most convenient method of getting rid of an awkward fact; little extension of it might make any word one pleased a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon.</span> The critics might have tried the method more reasonably on Daniel than on Ezekiel; but as their brief was against Daniel, that did not occur to them. The picture presented to us in this verse is one that in the <span class="accented">circumstances</span> is full of naturalness. We have, on the one hand, the eager entreaty of the Hebrew youth; the kindly look of the prince, willing to grant anything he possibly can to his favourite, yet hindered by fear for himself, and at the same time a desire that Daniel, his favourite, should stand well with the king. The chief of the eunuchs knew that personal good looks were an important matter with Nebuchadnezzar. If they were badly nourished, these Hebrew youths would be handicapped in their examination before the king. But more, shame at their own appearance would disturb them mentally, even if they were able to study as well on this plain food they desired. If the failure were egregious, then investigation might be demanded, and then the fact that he had transgressed the orders of the king would be a serious offence - the king knew no mercy when enraged. It is to be observed that the chief of the eunuchs first appeals to the self-interest of the youths before him, that they would endanger their own prospects; but as that does not move them, he next tells them that his own life would  be endangered. In this case we must remember we have merely a summary, and a very condensed summary, of what was probably a prolonged argument. We have only the heads, and probably the succession of the arguments. It may, perhaps, be regarded as a proof of the authenticity of this speech that two Aramaic words are preserved in it. The Rabsaris most certainly would speak in Aramaic, and technical words such as <span class="accented">geel</span> and <span class="accented">heyyabtem</span> might be retained even in a translation, if there were no word which was quite an exact equivalent. Thus in translations from French or German into English, how frequently are words transferred from the original tongue[ "One-sided" is a case in point. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-11.htm">Daniel 1:11</a></div><div class="verse">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</span> The reading of the Septuagint differs from the Massoretic in two particulars - instead of "Melzar," the name given is "Abiesdri," as in the third verse; and the verb <span class="accented">minnah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) is read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">munnoh</span>), "set over." The Peshitta reads instead of "Melzar,' in this verse, "Mashitzar" (but see ver. 16). This confirms the idea that this is a proper name, not an official title. If the assumption of the Septuagint is correct, then the name in the Massoretic text ought to be Hammelzar. This might indicate the name to be Amil-Assur, corresponding <span class="accented">to Amil-Merodach.</span> Theodotion renders the name <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;</span>. While a good deal can be said for making "Melzar" or "Ham-melzar" a proper name, something may also be said for the idea which has gained ground that "Melzar," since it has the article before it, is the name of an official. Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 196) makes the name <span class="accented">Amil-Ussur.</span> Such, at any rate, is the name of an official in the court of a Ninevite king; it is supposed to mean "steward," but it may be doubted if this is the exact equivalent of such an official as the one here referred to. Hitzig suggests <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, and for this rendering there is much to be said. It is an indirect proof of the antiquity of the book, that an official is referred to by a title the exact force of which had been forgotten when the Septuagint translation was produced, not later certainly than the  <span class="date">first century B.C.</span> Theodotion and Jerome are as far at sea as is also the Peshitta. The critical hypothesis is that this Assyrian name for "steward" remained known among the Palestinian Jews from the fall of the Babyloniau Empire in  <span class="date">B.C. 532</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>, and then in less than a couple of centuries utterly disappeared. The reading of the Septuagint," Abiesdri," may be laid aside; it is a reading that would suggest itself to any one who appreciated the difficulty of the passage. In the previous verse we were made auditors to a conversation between Daniel and Ashpenaz, in which he does not consent to Daniel's request. In the verse before us Daniel addresses another request to a new but subordinate official. As the request is one that might naturally follow the refusal, mild but to all appearance firm, of the prince of the eunuchs, what could be more natural than to imagine that <span class="accented">Amelzar</span> was a misreading for Abiesdri? The story has been condensed. Had we the full narrative, we most likely would have seen that Daniel had to go over the argument with the subordinate that he had already had with the superior. It is not unlikely that the prince of the eunuchs was not expressly informed of the experiment being tried,of which the verse which follows informs us. This would help to save him from the responsibility of the thing; it is not inconceivable that he intentionally kept himself uninformed. Not only has Daniel secured a personal influence over the prince of the eunuchs, but also over this Melzar, or steward. There are people in the world who have this magnetic power over their fellows which compels their liking. When with this are united abilities of a man to do exploits and leave his mark on the world, we have a national hero. Napoleon the Great was eminently a man of this kind. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-12.htm">Daniel 1:12</a></div><div class="verse">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span> The Septuagint seems to have read <span class="accented">yutan</span>, "let there be given," instead of <span class="accented">yitnu</span>, "let them give." <span class="accented">Zero'im</span>, "seeds" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Theodotion), "pulse" (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, Septuagint and Authorized and Revised Versions). This word occurs only here; it differs, however, only by the second vowel from <span class="accented">zeruim</span> in <a href="../../par/isaiah/61-11.htm">Isaiah 61:11</a>, and there it is rendered as by Theodotion here, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>. As the vowels were not written for centuries after the latest critical date of Daniel, it is in the highest degree absurd to ground any argument on the pronunciation affixed to the word by these late scribes, probably with as great caprice as made them maintain to all time "suspended letters" here and there in the text, or sometimes begin a word with a final <span class="accented">mere.</span> Professor Bevan regards this word a s possibly a scribe's mistake for <span class="accented">zeronim</span>, a word with the same meaning, which occurs in ver. 16, and is found in the Talmud. He might more naturally regard <span class="accented">zero'him as a</span> scribe's mistake for <span class="accented">zero'im.</span> As, however, the word is Aramaic, occurring both in the Eastern and Western dialects, it may be a case where the original word shines through. <span class="accented">Prove thy servants ten days.</span> The word used for "prove' is that frequently used of God in relation to men, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>,"  God did prove Abraham." Calvin thinks that Daniel made this request because he had been directed by the Divine Spirit. We would not for one moment deny that all wisdom comes down from above, and that it is the Spirit of the Almighty that giveth understanding, yet the suggestion was a reasonable one, the period was long enough to have given signs that it affected them injuriously, and yet not so long but the evil effects might easily be removed. <span class="accented">Ten days.</span> It may be that this is merely a round number - an easily marked period - but an experiment would have a definite period. It is approximately the third of a revolution of the moon, and as the Babylonians were attentive observers of the movements of the heavenly bodies, especially of the moon, "ten days" is likely enough to be a period with them, as certainly a week was. Moreover, among all the nations of antiquity numbers were credited with special powers, as all who have studied Greek philosophy know. Pythagoras rested the whole universe on number. This theory, in which to some extent he was followed by Plato, seems to have been derived from Assyrian, if not Babylonian sources. Thus Lenormant, in 'La Magic,' gives a dialogue between <span class="accented">Hea</span> and his son <span class="accented">Hilgq-mulu-qi.</span> Everything depends on knowing "the number." It may be noted, as bearing on this, that in the bas-reliefs portraying a feast from the palace of Asshurbanipal, the guests are seated in messes of four round small tables. If, then, as is probable, all these young cadets at the Babylonian court sat in the royal presence, they would have a table to themselves, and thus the peculiarity of their meal would not be patent to the whole company. Had the number of friends been more, they would have been conspicuous: had they been fewer, they would have been observed by those added to make up the number. Their request to be allotted to eat only pulse and to drink only water, had not, as we have already said, anything necessarily of the asceticism of the Essenes. They, the Essenes, rather started <span class="accented">from</span> Daniel and his friends. Maimonides tells us that there were three kinds of <span class="accented">zeronim - tbu'ah</span>, "crops," wheat, barley, millet, etc.; <span class="accented">gatonith</span>, "small crops," peas, beans, lentils; <span class="accented">geenah</span>, "garden seeds," such as mint, anise, and cummin. The English versions and the Septuagint agree in regarding the second of these classes as here intended. There is this to be said, that seeds are the most nourishing form of vegetable diet. Aben Ezra suggests "rice" as the seeds used for this purpose; but as, just as in all hot climates, vegetables and fruits of all sorts were largely consumed in Babylon, definition is unnecessary. To the present day among the inhabitants of the district around ancient Babylon, indeed, over the Levant generally, dates and raisins, with grain, and in the season fresh fruit, form the staple food. Daniel really prayed to live as the common people. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-13.htm">Daniel 1:13</a></div><div class="verse">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants</span>. The Septuagint Version here differs considerably from the Massoretic text; it is as follows: "And should our countenance appear more downcast than (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) those other youths who eat of the royal feast, according as thou seest good (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>), so deal with thy servants." In the text before the Septuagint translator <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">l'phaneka</span>), "before thee," is omitted, and instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">mareh</span>)," appearance," is read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">zo'aphim</span>), and after is inserted <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">min</span>), "from," the sign of the comparative, equivalent to "<span class="accented">than."</span> Theodotion, Jerome, and the Peshitta represent accurately the Massoretic text. Against the Septuagint reading is the fact that in the Massoretic, <span class="accented">marayeeaen is</span> construed a singular, but in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15.htm">Ezekiel 15</a>:10 it is plural. The vocalization of <span class="accented">tirayh</span>, "thou shalt see," is Aramaean, and therefore confirms the idea that this chapter is a translation in which the original shines through. The reading of the Septuagint implies that a different meaning must be put on the last clause from that in the English Version. It means that, should the experiment prove a failure, they were willing to suffer any punishment that the official in question saw good. Such an interference with the arrangements of the king would be a crime to be punished with stripes. Although a perfectly consistent sense can be brought from the text behind the Septuagint, yet, from the fact that the phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">zo'apheem min-hay'ladeem</span>), occurs in the tenth verse, and therefore may be repeated here by accident, we would not definitely prefer it. Further, the Massoretic text follows more naturally from the context. Let the steward see the result of the experiment after ten days, and, as he sees, so let him judge and act. Daniel and his companions  leave the matter thus really in the hands of Providence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-14.htm">Daniel 1:14</a></div><div class="verse">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span> The literal rendering is, And he <span class="accented">hearkened</span> unto <span class="accented">them as to this matter</span>, <span class="accented">proved them ten days.</span> The Septuagint reading is again peculiar, "And he dealt with them after this manner, and proved them ten days." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5e2;</span> is not very unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e9;&#x5d4;</span>, nor <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;</span> very unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, and this is all the change implied. The Massoretic reading seems the more natural, but it might be argued that this very naturalness is the result of an effort to make the Hebrew more flowing. But further, from the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>. ('<span class="accented">asayh</span>), imperative of the same verb, precedes almost immediately, the word might come in by accident, or another word somewhat like it might be misread into it. The consent of the subordinate official implies, if not the consent, at least the connivance, of the superior. As we have already explained from the arrangements of a Babylonian feast, the plan of the Hebrew youths could the more easily be carried out. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-15.htm">Daniel 1:15</a></div><div class="verse">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- At the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat</span>. The Septuagint is a little paraphrastic, and renders, "After ten days their countenance appeared beautiful and their habit of body better than that of the other young men who ate of the king's meat." Theodotion is painfully faithful to the Massoretic text. The Peshitta translates <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">tob</span>), "good," "fair," by <span class="accented">sha-peera</span>, "beautiful." We have here the result of the experiment. At the end of the ten days these youths who had lived plainly are fairer and fatter than those who partook of the royal dainties - a result that implies nothing miraculous; it was simply the natural result of living on food suited to the climate. The grammar of the passage is peculiar; <span class="accented">mareehem</span>, which so far as form goes might be plural, is construed with a singular verb and adjective, but <span class="accented">bere'eem</span>, "fatter," is plural. The explanation is that while "countenance," the substantive, is in the singular, it is not the substantive to the adjective "fat," but "they" understood. The sentence is not intended to assert that their faces merely were fatter than those of the other youths of their rank and circum<span class="accented">stances</span>, but that their whole body was so. This contrast of reference is brought out in the Septuagint paraphrase. Any one looking on the Assyrian and Babylonian sculptures, and comparing them with the sculptures and paintings of Egypt, will observe the relatively greater stoutness of the Assyrians. In the eunuchs especially, one cannot fail to <span class="accented">notice</span> the full <span class="accented">round</span> faces and the double chins of those in immediate attendance on the king. Among savage nations and semi-civilized ones, corpulence is regarded as a sign of nobility. The frequent long fasts, due to failure of their scanty crops or the difficulty of catching game, would keep the ordinary savage spare; only one who could employ the sinews and <span class="accented">possessions</span> of others would be sure of being always well fed, consequently the corpulent man was incontestably the wealthy nobleman. In semi-civilized countries, as Babylon, this was probably a survival. On the sculptures the kings are not unwieldy with corpulence, but the eunuchs have an evident tendency to this. A king, abstemious himself, might feel his consequence increased by having as his attendants those who bore about in their persons the evidence of how well those were nourished who fed at his table. There is no reason to imagine that Nebuchadnezzar was superior to his contemporaries in regard to this. The <span class="accented">melzar</span>, having thus seen the result of the experiment, must see that, so far as externals were concerned, the Hebrews who fed on pulse were better than their companions. The period of ten days was a short one, but not too short for effects such as those mentioned to be manifested. Jephet-ibn-Ali thinks that special leanness was inflicted on those who were unfaithful or had failed in courage. That, however, is an unnecessary supposition. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-16.htm">Daniel 1:16</a></div><div class="verse">Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Thus Melzar took away the portion of their moat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. The Massoretic has the article here before "Melzar" - a fact that the Authorized does not indicate; the Revised renders more correctly, "the steward." The version of the Septuagint does not differ much from the Massoretic, only the word translated "that they should drink" is omitted; on the other hand, we have the verb <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) put in composition with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>), "gave them instead," as if, in the text before the translator, the <span class="accented">mem</span>, which begins <span class="accented">mishtayhem</span>, had been put to the end of <span class="accented">yayin</span>, "wine," making it "their wine" - a construction which would be more symmetrical than the present. Only it is difficult to see how either <span class="accented">tahath asher</span> could be changed into <span class="accented">shtayhem</span>, or vice <span class="accented">versa.</span> The Septuagint translation suggests a simpler and more natural text - not a simplified one - therefore it is, on the whole, to be preferred. The careful word-for-word translation of the beginning of the verse renders it little likely that the translator would paraphrase at the end; c g. the word translated in our version "thus" is really <span class="accented">veeay'he</span>, "it was," and in the LXX. this is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, "it was." Theodotion  is in absolute agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta calls the steward <span class="accented">ma</span>-<span class="accented">nitzor</span>, and renders the last clause, "<span class="accented">and</span> he gave to them seeds to eat, and water to drink," evidently borrowed from the twelfth verse. The result of the success of the experiment is that the youths are no more importuned to partake of the king's dainties. The steward, or the attendant who looked after their <span class="accented">mess</span>, supplied them with pulse. It has occurred to two commentators, widely separated from each other in point of time, that the consent of the "Melzar ' was all the more easily gained, that he could utilize the abstemiousness of these Hebrew youths to his own private advantage. Both Jephet-ibn-Ali in the beginning of the eleventh century, and Ewald in the middle of the nineteenth, maintain that the "Melzar' used to his own purposes, possibly sold, the portion of food and wine that the Hebrew youths abjured. Certainly the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> means the lifting and carrying away, and suggests that every day the portions of food and wine were first carried to the table of these Hebrews, and then, after having been placed before them, were removed and pulse brought instead. When we think of it, some such process would have to take place. If it had been observed that one table was never supplied with a portion from the king's table, there might have been remarks made, and the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> would have fallen into disgrace with his sovereign, and the Hebrew youths would possibly have shared his disgrace. As to how the portions thus retained were disposed of, we need not be curious; there would, no doubt, be plenty of claimants for the broken victuals from the King of Babylon's table, without accusing the "Melzar" of dishonest motives. The fact that the verbs are in participle implies that henceforth it was the regular habit of the "<span class="accented">Melzar"</span> to remove from before the tour friends the royal dainties, and supply them instead with pulse. We have already referred to the word used for "<span class="accented">pulse</span>; ' it is here <span class="accented">zayroneem</span>, whereas in the twelfth verse it is <span class="accented">zayroeem.</span> Not impossibly in the verse before us we have another case of the original Aramaic shining through the translation; in the Peshitta the word is <span class="accented">zer'oona</span>,  Whatever the word was, it seems certain that originally it was the same in both places, as in none of the versions is there any variation. It is not so impossible that originally the vocalization was different, and that the word was the ordinary word <span class="accented">zer'aim</span>, "seeds." This certainly is the translation of Theodotion.

This indicates that somehow they were separated off into a quaternion. In Ezekiel, where a similar phrase cecum, the four cherubim form a quaternion in a very special way. As we have already seen, the Assyrians in a feast arranged the guests in messes of four. Those thus seated together would most likely be associated in some other way. In the case of these youths, who were permanent guests at the table of the King of Babylon, they would most likely be associated in their studies from the first. The Septuagint Version omits the numeral, but is pleonastic in a way that suggests a coalescing of different readings. The rendering is, "And to the youths the Lord gave understanding and knowledge and wisdom in the art of learning (the grammatic art - grammar), and to Daniel he gave understanding of every kind (in every word), and in visions, and in dreams, and in every kind of wisdom." The omission of the word "four," and the insertion of two words, "understanding" and "knowledge," suggest that the one has somehow taken the place of the other; it may be that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> was read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>. The Massoretic original of the phrase, "skill in all learning," may be rendered literally, "skill in every kind of books." This has a special meaning in regard to the Babylonian and Assyrian books, which were clay tablets incised when wet, and burnt into permanence. Rolls of parchment were, as we see from Jeremiah, the common material for books among the Jews. Among the Egyptians, papyrus largely took the place of parchment, so the knowledge "of every kind of books" meant "every language." It is certain that three languages were to a certain extent in use in Babylon - Aramaic, the ordinary language of business and diplomacy; Assyrian, the court language, the language in which histories and dedications were written; Accadian, the old sacred tongue, in which all the formulae of worship and the forms of incantation had been originally written. From the fact that Rabshakeh could talk Hebrew when conversing with Eliakim and Shebna, it would seem that the accomplish-merit required from a diplomat implied the knowledge of the languages of the various nations subject to the Babylonian Empire or eonterminous with it. "Knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom" would seem to mean the complete eurriculum fitted to make these youths able diplomatists and wise councillors. <span class="accented">And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> All the nations of antiquity laid stress on  dreams as means by which the future was revealed to men; but in no nation was there so elaborate a system of interpretation as among the Babyhmians. Lenormant ('La Divination') gives a long account, with many passages translated from their books, of their mode of interpreting dreams. "Visions" may be regarded as appearances of the nature of the alleged second sight among the Scottish Highlanders. It may, however, refer to appearances which are regarded as omens of good or evil fortune. We see in all the elaborate distinctions of omens preserved to us in Lenormant only the folly of superstition; but we may not assume that Daniel and his friends did not believe in them. It has been objected that if Daniel and his friends were so scrupulous in regard to the dainties and. the wines of the Babylonian monarch, because these were connected with idol-worship, they ought logically to have refused to learn these superstitious formulae. But men are never completely logical; life is wider than logic, and hence there are always elements that are left out in our calculations. The possession even of Divine inspiration would not suffer men to annul the two millennia and a half that separate us from the days of Daniel. They - Daniel and his friends - did not see in this so-called science of oneiromancy mere superstition. Still less did they recognize it as having a necessary connection with the idolatries of Babylon. In the following chapter we see the theory Daniel himself had of the matter, namely, that God used dreams as means to make known the future to men. No one can say he was mistaken in this. When Luther described heaven to his child, he filled it with what would be most happy for the little boy; he takes the child at the stage at which he is, and tells him the truth, but in limitations suited to his knowledge. May we not reasonably argue that the great Father deals so with his children? When they are in the state of knowledge that makes them expect to have his will revealed to them in dreams and omens, then he will make known his will by dreams. Daniel knew all that Chaldean science could tell him, but he saw that it was limited, that behind all the canons of interpretation there was the Eternal Mind, the Great Thinker, whose thoughts are things. In other words, he did not recognize the so-called science of Babylon, its astrology, its incantations, its omens, its interpretations of dreams as false so much as limited. It has been placed by Jerome as a parallel, that Moses was learned in all the learning of the Egyptians. Jerome assumes "they learned not that they might follow, but that they might judge and convict (<span class="accented">convincant</span>)." We do not see the need of any such supposition. In their own land they in all likelihood believed in the interpretation of dreams, not unlikely in omens too in some degree. When they came to Babylon they came among a people who halt reduced all this to a form that had a delusive appearance of scientific accuracy. They could not fail to believe in all these things. Long after the latest critical date of Daniel, the Jews believed in omens and dreams. Josephus tells us of his own skill in these matters, and is still more explicit in respect to the wisdom of the Essenes in regard to the future. Students of the Talmud will not require to be told of the <span class="accented">bath-qol</span> and other means by which a knowledge of the future was derived. We must, we fear, assume that Daniel was not so far ahead of his contemporaries as not to believe in the science of Babylon, and therefore to expect him to protest against it and refuge to acquire it is absurd in the last degree. This fact of these four Hebrew youths not objecting to heathen learning is n indirect proof of the early date of Daniel. <span class="accented">It</span> this book had been written in the days of the Maccabees, then the learning of the Chaldeans would be a synonym for the learning of the Greeks. We know that, so far from the <span class="accented">Hasideem -</span> the party from whom, by hypothesis, "Daniel" emanated - looking favourably on Greek learning, they hated and abhorred it. We see in the Second Book of Maccabees (4:14) the feelings with which they regarded those who favoured Greek manners; how even the innocent game of <span class="accented">discus</span> was full of horror for them, because it was Greek (1:14); and in the first book with what horror the pious looked on the erection of a gymnasium in Jerusalem. This hatred of everything Greek was very natural, and certainly was very much in evidence in their history. For business purposes they had to know the Greek language; but the learning, the philosophy, and literature of Greece would have been to those engaged in the Maccabean struggle abomination. Is it, then, to be imagined that a writer of the Maccabean period, describing an ancient hero from whose example his contemporaries were to draw encouragement and guidance, would represent him as zealously addicting himself to the pursuit of Gentile learning, and making such progress in it that he excelled all competitors? The attitude ascribed to him would have been more like that of the Rabbi Akiba, who declared that "Greek learning could be studied in an hour that was neither day nor night;" or like that other rabbi, who declared that "the translation of the Scripture into Greek was a disaster to Judaism equal in horror to the  fall of Jerusalem." We hear a great deal of the historic imagination and the necessity of applying it to questions of Biblical criticism. Surely the minds must be strangely deficient in the power of imaginative reconstruction who cannot feel the thrill of abhorrence of everything foreign that must have filled the Jews during the Maccabean struggle. If the critics had only realized this, they would have seen how utterly impossible it is to conceive that a religious novel, written at that time, intended to nerve the Jews for fiercer resistance to their oppressors, should represent the hero complacently acquiring Gentile learning, and acting the submissive courtier in the tyrant's palace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18</a></div><div class="verse">Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now at the end of the clays that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> The Septuagint Version here is shorter and simpler: "After these days the king commanded to bring them in, and they were brought in by the prince of the eunuchs." The only difference is that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">haayleh</span>) is read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">asher</span>), and the <span class="accented">maqqeph</span> dropped. Theodotion is in close accordance with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is also simpler than the Massoretic text, though founded on it: "And after the completion of the days which the king had arranged, the chief of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar the king." Both the Massoretic and Peshitta texts represent the prince of the eunuchs bringing the youths before King Nebuchadnezzar when the time had elapsed, without any orders from the king himself. According to the Septuagint, it was the king himself that required them to be presented before him. It seems more like the active-minded king, that he should recall his purpose of examining these youths, and command them to be brought in, than that the prince of the eunuchs should bring them trooping in without warning into the royal presence. Such an examination, whether conducted by the king personally, or in his presence, or under his superintendence, would need to be prepared fur; something equivalent to examination papers, test questions, would have to be arranged, or the presentation before the king would be a farce. All this implies that Nebuchadnezzar himself arranged the time of the appearance of those youths before him. We can scarcely imagine the awe with which those young captives must have looked forward to standing before the terrible conqeueror who had swept the army of Egypt before him, and had overthrown all who ventured to oppose him, who had sent home hosts of captives to throng the slave-markets of Babylon. We are not told whether each separately was brought before Nebuchadnezzar, or whether the whole number of the cadets were presented at once. It is the earliest instance of promotion by competitive examination. The clear, sharp eye of the young conqueror was probably worth more than all the questions prepared. While certainly the words used seem to imply that the hostages were called merely to be examined, the occasion may have been the "dream" narrated in the next chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a></div><div class="verse">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azarish: therefore stood they before the king.</span> The word translated "communed" really means "spake," and is the common word for this. The Septuagint translates here <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which does mean "commune." Theodotion renders <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. Jerome has <span class="accented">loeutus</span>; the Peshitta has <span class="accented">malel</span>; all these may be rendered "talked." From Nebuchadnezzar's great reverence for the national religion and for the national magic, we may be certain that much of the conversation would turn on those magical formulae which have been to such a large extent preserved to us. Even if, as we think, the immediate occasion of Daniel and his companions appearing before the king was his "dream," still he would not unnaturally examine them further. It is not unlikely that this conversational examination would involve naturally the languages they would have to be proficient in were they to be of the royal council. They would have to be acquainted with Accadian, the original tongue of all the most sacred magical formulae; with Assyrian, the language in which the royal annals were recorded; and with Aramaic, which was, as we have already said, the language of commerce and diplomacy. Hebrew, the language of the four in whom we are more especially interested, was spoken, not merely by the holy people, but also by the Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, and the Phoenicians. Further, Egypt was a factor that had to be taken into account, and so, not unlikely, the tongue of Egypt would be known by some, at any rate, of the court officials in Babylon. The empire of the Hittites had certainly passed away, but, probably, their language was still known and spoken by a large number of the inhabitants of Nebuchadnezzar's extensive empire. Not only were the languages of peoples west of Babylon to be considered, but also those to the east; there were the Aryan tongues too. If the tradition is correct that Nebuchadnezzar married a Median wife, the Median tongue, which seems to have been the same with that of Persia, would be, above all, important, Not unlikely questions of policy  and statecraft would be submitted to these candidates, to see what they would say. Above all, in personal intercourse the King of Babylon would be able to form some estimate of the real worth of these youths, There probably would enter in a large measure of caprice, or even superstition, into his choice, yet not unlikely his strong practical sense would limit his superstition. The result of this examination is eminently satisfactory to the young Hebrews. They were found superior to all their competitors. <span class="accented">Therefore stood they before the king.</span> Professor Bevan would render this "became his personal attendants" - a very natural translation. We know, from the Ninevite marbles, that the king is always, alike on the field of battle, the hunting-field, and the council-chamber, attended by eunuchs. It may, however, be regarded as referring to the special subjects of their study. As they had been admitted to the class of magicians and astrologers, it would mean they were admitted to the number of those who were royal magicians and astrologers - those whom the king consulted. It is not to be understood that, even though they were admitted to this number, they were therefore necessarily admitted before the king in this capacity on ordinary occasions. They would occupy but a subordinate position in the huge Babylonian hierarchy. We must note here a variation in the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "they were." We, for our part, agree with Professor Bevan, in regarding this as a scribal blunder in the Greek, and that the original text was probably <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. The only difficulty is that the blunder is also in Paulus Tellensis. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a></div><div class="verse">And in all matters of wisdom <i>and</i> understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians <i>and</i> astrologers that <i>were</i> in all his realm.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</span> The Septuagint rendering here has a considerable addition, which really means, as it seems to us, the coalescence of two readings. It reads thus: "And in all learning (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x1ff3;</span>, a literal rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">dabhar</span>, 'a word' or 'thing'), and knowledge and education (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>) whatsoever the king asked of them, he found them ten times wiser than all the wise and learned men in all his kingdom." Thus far the verse is a rendering, almost slavishly close, of the Massoretic text; while the translator has recognized that the sentence is incomplete as it stands, and has inserted <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">al</span>) by <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span>. But the translation proceeds, "And the king honoured them, and appointed them rulers." This seems to have been due to a various reading. The sentence here translated was probably, in an old recension of the text, all that stood here, and some scribe, finding it, inserted it here to complete the sentence. The translation, however, proceeds yet further, "And constituted (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) them wiser than all those of his in affairs in all his land and in his kingdom." This sentence has all the appearance of an attempt to render into Greek a piece of Hebrew that the translator imperfectly understood. <span class="accented">As</span> we find that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>, represents occasionally <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span>, and as the Syriac <span class="accented">vav</span> and the old Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;</span> were almost identical in shape, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">yod'a</span>,) might be read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span> evidently the translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5db;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hacmeem</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5bb;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">hartummeem</span>), and has transferred the '<span class="accented">al col</span> from before <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> to before the next word, which seems to have read, not '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, but <span class="accented">hartzo</span>, the relative seems to have been omitted, and the second <span class="accented">col</span>, "all." This great variety of reading suggests suspicions of the verse altogether, which the content of the verse rather strengthens. Theodotion is in strict agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta also is at one with it in this, but these are late compared with the Septuagint. It has been tea,sued that the Book of Daniel is a story modelled on the history of Joseph, and the presence of <span class="accented">harlummeem</span> here is regarded as a proof of this <span class="accented">quasi</span> Egyptian origin (see <a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a>, etc.). One thing is clear, that the word - whatever it was - was unknown in Alexandria, where this translation was made; <span class="accented">hartummeern</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> occurring in the Pentateuch, the earliest part of the Old Testament translated, was certain to be known: how did the word here happen not to be known? We can understand the phenomenon if some word, probably of Babylonian origin, and unknown in Egypt and Palestine, occupied the place and was modified into a more intelligible shape by being turned into <span class="accented">hartummeem.</span> As the verse stands, <span class="accented">hartummeem is</span> grammatically placed in apposition to the following word, '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span>, as there is no conjunction to unite the two words. It is acknowledged by Professor Bevan that the latter word has an Assyrian origin; it is not inconceivable that <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> is really the explanatory word, though the arrangement of the words is decidedly against this view. It is to be observed here that '<span class="accented">ashshapheem</span> has been naturalized in Eastern Aramaic, but has not found a lodgment in Western, save in Daniel. We cannot help feeling a little suspicion of the authenticity of this verse. This phrase, "ten times better," has all the look of that exaggeration which became the prevailing vice of later Judaism. As we have indicated, the variations in regard to the precise reading deepen this suspicion. If, however, the reference here is really to Daniel's revelation to the king  of his dream, then the statement in the text is less objectionable. This was such a marvellous feat, and one that so put Daniel boys all the wise men of Babylon, that the language of the verse before us is rather rhetorical than exaggerated. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/1-21.htm">Daniel 1:21</a></div><div class="verse">And Daniel continued <i>even</i> unto the first year of king Cyrus.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus.</span> The Septuagint supplies <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic. It has been objected by Canon Driver that the natural classical order of the latter two words should have been <span class="accented">hammelek Koresh</span>, not, as it is in the Massoretic, <span class="accented">Koresh hammelek.</span> The Septuagint text seems to have had <span class="accented">parseem</span>, which would make the order perfectly classical. A greater difficulty is to explain how it is said that Daniel "continued," or, if we take the Hebrew literally "was," until the <span class="accented">first</span> year of "Cyrus the king," when in the tenth chapter the third year of Cyrus is referred to. There are several ways of getting over this difficulty. The first way is to suppose that some words have dropped out of the text. There are, however, different ideas as to the words so lost. Thus Bleak would supply "in high respect in Babylon." Earlier commentators would supply "in Babylon," thinking that not impossibly he returned to Palestine. Jerome  - one of these - does not, however, intrude his suggestion into the text, as does Ewald. His suggestion is that the omitted words are "in the king's court," which is much the same as Delitzsch's "at the court." Hitzig is credited by Kranichfeld with asserting that the author did not intend to make his hero live beyond the year he refers to - the first year of Cyrus. In his commentary, however, Hitzig suggests that <span class="accented">b"</span><span class="accented">sha'ar hammelek</span>, "in the gate of the king," has dropped out. He does certainly hint that the sentence, to be complete, would need <span class="accented">hayah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>), not <span class="accented">hayah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). Zockler would supply the same word. There is certainly this to be said for the above theory - that the sentence as it stands is incomplete. The verb <span class="accented">hayah</span> is never used instead of h<span class="accented">ayah.</span> At the same time, there is no trace in any of the versions of any difficulty in regard to the text. Another method of meeting the difficulty is that adopted by Hengstenberg, followed by Havernick, but suggested in the eleventh century by Jephet-ibn-Ali. It is this - that as the first year of Cyrus was the year when he allowed the Jews to return to their own laud, that the attainment of this <span class="accented">annus mirabilis</span> was an element in his wonderful prosperity, that he who had mourned for the sins of his people, who had been one of the earliest to feel the woes of captivity, should live to see the curse removed, and Judah permitted to return to their city and temple. The objection to this view, urged by Professor Bevan, is that the author elsewhere "never alludes to the event save indirectly (<a href="../../par/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25</a>)." To this it may be answered that the whole ninth chapter goes on the assumption that the seventy years are now all but over, and therefore that the return cannot be long delayed. We regard this silence of Daniel in respect to the return from Babylon as one of the strongest evidences of the authenticity of the book. Everybody knows how largely it bulks in preceding prophecy, and how important it is in after-days. No one writing a religious romance could have failed to have laid great prominence on this event, and introduced Daniel as inducing Cyrus to issue the decree. On the contrary, he does not even mention it. Tide is precisely the conduct that would be followed by a contemporary at the present time. In religious biographies of the past generation that involve the year 1832, when the Reform Act was passed - the greatest political change of this century - we find that most of them never once refer to it. If any one should take Cowper's 'Letters,' written during the American War, he will find comparatively few references to the whole matter, although from, at all events, 1780 to 1783, we have letters for nearly every week, and they occupy nearly three hundred pages. Now, if a person were condensing these and selecting passages from them, he might easily make such a selection as would contain not a single reference to that war or to any political event whatever. Yet Cowper was interested in the struggle that was going on. The main objection to Hengstenberg's view is the grammatical one that it implies that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>, and there is no trace in the versions of this various reading The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>; Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>; the Peshitta has  (<span class="accented">hu</span>); Jerome has <span class="accented">fuit.</span> It is somewhat difficult to come to any conclusion, but there are certain things we must bear in mind. In the first place, an author does not usually contradict his statements elsewhere directly. He may implicitly do so, but not when direct dates are given. If he should fail to put the matter right, some other will be sure to do so, if his work attains sufficient popularity to be commented upon. We may thus be sure that there is some solution of the apparent contradiction between the verse before us and ch. 10. In the next place, we must note that this verse is the work of the editor, probably also the translator and condenser, of this earlier part of Daniel.  Therefore the difference may be found quite explicable could we go back to the Aramaic original. If '<span class="accented">ad</span> represented '<span class="accented">ad di</span> (<a href="../../par/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>) in the Aramaic, and the two latter clauses were transposed, we should translate, "And Daniel was for Cyrus the king even before his first year." The connection is somewhat violent; but if we regard the redactor as thinking of the success of Daniel, this might be a thought which suggested itself to his mind - he was with Nebuchadnezzar, and he was with Cyrus. The difficulty of the date is not of importance. That might be got over in several ways. Either by adopting in <a href="../../par/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a> the reading of the Septuagint, which is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x1ff3;</span> - the only objection to this is that it is a correction that might easily be made by a would-be harmonist; but, on the other hand, the "third" year of Belshazzar being mentioned in the eighth chapter may have occasioned the insertion of "third" in the tenth. Or, since we know that, though in his proclamation Cyrus styles himself "King of Babil," yet in some of the contract tables of the flint two years of his reign he is not called "King of Babil," but only "king of nations," and there are contract tables of those years that are even dated by the years of Nabunahid, is it not, then, possible that the third year of Cyrus as "king of nations" might coincide with the first year of his reign as "King of Babil"? Yet further, we must remember that the reign of Cyrus could be reckoned from several different starting-points. He first appears as King of Ansan, then he becomes King of the Persians, and as such he conquers Babylon. His first year as King of Babylon may have been his third year as King of Persia. Thus it would be equally true to say that the Emperor William I. of Germany died in the seventeenth and in the twenty-eighth year of his reign - the one statement reckoning his reign as emperor, the other as king. No solution seems absolutely satisfactory. The difficulty presses equally on the critics and those who maintain the traditional opinion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../ezekiel/48.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Ezekiel 48"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Ezekiel 48" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/2.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 2"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 2" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/2.htm"><title>Daniel 2 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/2.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/2-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/1.htm" title="Daniel 1">&#9668;</a> Daniel 2 <a href="../daniel/3.htm" title="Daniel 3">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a></div><div class="verse">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-49.</span> - DANIEL FIRST BECOMES DISTINGUISHED. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him</span>. The versions only differ verbally from the Massoretic text as represented by the above. The Septuagint renders "And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, he chanced to fall into dreams and visions, and to be troubled with his vision, and his sleep went from him." The differences here that may evidence a difference of text are slight. Theodotion and the Peshitta are very close to the Massoretic. The Vulgate renders, "In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar saw a vision, and his spirit was troubled, and his vision (<span class="accented">somnium</span>) fled from him." If this is the true text of the Vulgate - and it is pre-Clementine - the variation seems too great for paraphrase, and yet it is an unlikely lectional variation. It is easier to imagine the change taking place in the Latin, <span class="accented">somnus</span> becoming <span class="accented">somnium</span>, especially if the final m was represented, as so often in Latin manuscripts, by a line over the preceding vowel. <span class="accented">And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar.</span> This forms one of the chronological difficulties in the interpretation of Daniel. There seems to be a contradiction between the statement in this verse and the chronological data afforded us by the preceding chapter. If Nebuchadnezzar was already king when he placed Daniel and his three companions in the hands of "Ashpeuaz" and assigned them three years of study, then as the three years are by implication ended when the examination took place (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18, 19</a>), the events narrated in this chapter must be dated not earlier than the third year of Nebuchadnezzar. Most commentators recognize this as a difficulty, the explaining of which is incumbent on them, whatever their views as to the date or authenticity of the book as a whole may be. A really great writer - and that title cannot be denied to the author of "Daniel," if the book be a fiction - could never fall into such a glaring self-contradiction. We do not deny that even very great writers have been guilty of chronological self-contradictions; but these contradictions were such as were not obvious. The only commentator who does not feel it incumbent on him, having noticed the difficulty, to give some hint of a possible solution, is Professor Bevan. From the obviousness of the discrepancy, we must assume that it was known to the writer, and from this we must further assume that the discrepancy was regarded by him as a merely apparent one, the explanation of which was so obvious at the time he wrote that it was needless to state it. In making this statement, we refer to the original documents from which our present Daniel was compiled. Another hypothesis certainly is possible - that there is a false reading here. Ewald has suggested the twelfth year, which implies that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">esreh</span>) has been omitted. The main difficulty is that there is no sign that there is any difference of reading. If we are to correct the reading, we must go behind the present book to those documents from which it has been formed. If this portion of Daniel is a translation and a condensation of an Aramaic text, then <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tar'teen</span>) is "two," but "three" would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">t'lath</span>). When the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> loses from any cause its upper part, it becomes little distinguishable from n; this renders it not impossible that in the original Aramaic narrative the events in this chapter were dated "the third year of Nebuchadnezzar," not "the second." This explanation does not apply to the older form of script as seen in Sindschirli or in Egypt. There have been various other ways of getting over the difficulty. One device, that of Josephus ('Antiq.,' 10:10. 3), maintained also by Jephet-ibn-Ali, is to date the reign from the conquest of Egypt, when Daniel is supposed to reckon that Nebuchadnezzar began to reign over the world. The conquest of Egypt, by means of certain recondite interpretations of Scripture, Jephet dates in the thirtieth year of Nebuchadnezzar; the date of this chapter, then, according to him, is the thirty-second year of Nebuchadnezzar. Rashi explains this date by referring it to the destruction of the temple. There is, however, nothing to indicate that any of these dates was ever reckoned of importance in Babylonian chronology. And, however important the destruction of the temple was to the Jews, few of them, even at the latest date criticism assigns to Daniel, would have the hardihood  to date a monarch's reign from this. Another solution is that the second year is reckoned from the time when these Jewish captives stood before the king. This would have implied a different reading, but, as we have said, so far as this clause is concerned, there is no variation. Another suggestion may be made, viz. that this appearance of Daniel before the king is the same as that mentioned in the previous chapter (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18-20</a>). This is Wieseler's hypothesis. As a reign was not reckoned from the date of accession, but from the beginning of the year following, Nebuchadnezzar's second year might well be the third year of the training of those Hebrew captives. The occasion of their appearance before the king may not have been that he took thought on the matter - a view which, though that of the Massoretic text, is not supported by the LXX. - but may have been caused by this disquieting dream. On the supposition which we have suggested, that in ch. 1. we have a condensed version from an Aramaic original, this solution is plausible. The main difficulty, that the quiet communing implied in the nineteenth verse does not suit the fury of the king and the threatened death of the wise men, cannot be pressed, as the communing might follow the interpretation. It may seem to some better to maintain that the incidents of this chapter occurred some little time after Daniel and his three companions were admitted to the royal council. The band of captives and hostages, with the mass of the Babylonian army, arrived at Babylon, according to Berosus, some time after Nebuchadnezzar himself, who had hurried across the desert; still, a month would probably be the utmost of the difference. There might, therefore, be many months to run before the first year of Nebuchadnezzar actually began, when these captives were placed under the charge of the Melzar; so that if our suggestion of a various reading of "third" instead of "second" be accepted, the years would be over while the "third" year of Nebuchadnezzar was still proceeding. However, although many prisoners and hostages may have been sent along with the main army, after Nebuchadnezzar ]earned of the death of his father, many may have been sent earlier, and among these Daniel. The main difficulty is to imagine the orders of Nebuchadnezzar, while merely crown prince, being carried out with such exactness, or that he should be spoken of as "my lord the king" (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-10.htm">Daniel 1:10</a>). But their training must have begun during the lifetime of Nabopolassar, if the three years were completed while the see(rod year of Nebuchadnezzar was still to finish. If we reject both these solutions, we are shut up to the idea that there is something amiss with the reading - always a thing to be deprecated - and the simplest emendation is to imagine that the "third" has been misread "second." This, as we have shown, would be easy in Aramaic. On the assumption that the text before us is a translation and condensation of an Aramaic text, it is easy to understand how all derivative texts followed its initial mistake. There is a certain importance here due to the copula "and:" "And in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar." When any cue attempts to read this verse in connection with the last verse of the first chapter, it at once becomes clear that the twenty-first verse of ch. 1. is an interpolation. It is probable that the condensation, which was likely to be considerable in the first chapter, becomes less so now, before passing from the one portion to the other; hence either the translator or some other added the note which is contained in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-21.htm">Daniel 1:21</a>. <span class="accented">Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams.</span> The Greek versions and the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis omit the name "Nebuchadnezzar," either as nominative or as genitive. The Peshitta follows the order of the Massoretic text. The omission does not alter the sense; possibly the proper names thus came in close juxtaposition in the Massoretic in consequence of an endeavour to condense by omission, without making any further change. It would seem that the LXX. had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">niq'ra</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">halam</span>). The rendering is, "It happened (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>) that the king fell into dreams and visions." This awkward sentence seems to be the result of a difficulty and consequent slavish following of the text before the translator; it is difficult to imagine what the reading could be which could be translated as it is in the Septuagint, and vet was not totally unlike the Massoretic text. "Dreams and visions" is the evident result of a coalescence of two renderings of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">halomoth</span>). It is to be observed that it is "dreams" that Nebuchadnezzar had, and yet only one "dream" is spoken cf. Kliefeth thinks this refers merely to the class, so that "dreamed dreams' is equivalent to "was dreaming." Agreeing with this is Havernick. Jephet-ibn-Ali take the plurality to refer to the contents of the dream - that it refers to the four world kingdoms and that of Israel (so Kranichfe;d and Keil); for a similar use of plural for singular, he refers to <a href="../../par/genesis/37-8.htm">Genesis 37:8</a>. Moses Stuart thinks that it is implied that the dream was repeated. It seems to be somewhat of a mannerism of Daniel to use plural for singular, as the "visions of the head" of ch. 4. <span class="accented">Wherewith his spirit was troubled.</span> The same phrase  occurs in regard to Pharaoh (<a href="../../par/genesis/41-8.htm">Genesis 41:8</a>), when he had dreamed of the seven kine and seven ears of corn. The similarity of the thing to be stated might easily lead to a similarity of statement, without there being any necessary copying. If, as we believe, this portion of Daniel had an Aramaic original, the resemblance in language to Genesis proves very little. In this case also the reading of the Septuagint is different. Instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">ruho</span>), "his spirit," the translators must have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>; also instead of the feminine <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">tith'pa'em</span>), the reading must have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">yith'pa'em</span>). Though <span class="accented">yod</span> and <span class="accented">tan</span> are not readily confused, <span class="accented">nun</span> and <span class="accented">tan</span> in the older script are, and in Eastern Aramaic <span class="accented">nun</span> is the preformative of the third person imperfect, and a change may have been made in translating from the Aramaic. Professor Fuller, following Saadia, makes too much of the fact that, while in the present case the conjugation used is the hithpael, in Genesis it is niphal, since the niphal conjugation occurs in ver. 3. Kranichfeld holds that the "hithpael heightens the idea lying in the niphal." In Biblical Aramaic hithpael takes the place of the Hebrew niphal. <span class="accented">And his sleep brake from him.</span> While the meaning here is plain, the words are used in an unusual sense; the word here translated "brake from" is the passive of the verb "to be," in this precise sense only used here. The fact that the substantive verb in Eastern Aramaic has this significance (Nestle, 'Gram. Syr.,' 100) indicates that this is a case where the Syriac original shines through the translation. This is all the more obvious when we remember that in Eastern Aramaic <span class="aramaic">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">nun</span>) was in the pre-formative. Analogous to this is the Latin use of the perfect of the substantive verb, <span class="accented">e.g. funimus Troes</span>; comp. <a href="../../par/romans/6-17.htm">Romans 6:17</a>," God be thanked that ye <span class="accented">were</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) the servants of sin." As we have said, the meaning of this verse is perfectly clear, and although there are differences of reading, there are none theft affect the sense. "In the second (or third) year of his reign, Nebuchaduezzar had a dream." To us in the West, living in the nineteenth century after Christ, it seems puerile to date so carefully a dream, of all things; but in the East, six hundred years before Christ, dreams had a very different importance from what they have now. In the history of Asshur-baui-pal dreams play a great part. Gyges submits to him in consequence of a dream In consequence of a dream Urdamane (Nut-mi-ammon) invades Egypt. Again and again is Asshur-bald-pal encouraged by dreams which appear to seers. It is ignorance of this that makes Hitzig declare, "The character of the king as here represented to us has no verisimilitude." Although Heredotus does make dreams prominent in his history, we could not imagine any of the <span class="accented">diadochi</span> recording and dating his dreams as does Asshur-bani-pal. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams.

And they came and steed before the king." The difference is slight verbally, but very important. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree closely with the Massoretic. The Vulgate renders <span class="accented">mecashe-pheem</span>, "sorcerers," <span class="accented">malefici</span>, "evil workers." <span class="accented">Then the king commanded to call the magi</span>cians. The scene seems to stand out before us - the king, excited and sleepless, calling out to his attendants to summon to his presence all the wise men in the capital of his empire. The first that are named are the <span class="accented">hartummeem.</span> The name is derived by Gesenius from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">heret</span>), "a stylus," and he supposes them to be sacred scribes. We find the word in <a href="../../par/genesis/41-24.htm">Genesis 41:24</a>. Although the order may have existed among the Egyptians, the name given to them here and in Exodus may quite well have a Semitic origin. The Tel-el-Amarna tablets show us how well the language of Assyria was known in Egypt. Hitzig is quite sure that Nebuchadnezzar "est Abbild des Pharao und zugleich Vorbild des Antiochus Epiphanes." It is a way critics have; they are always quite sure. It may be observed that both the Greek versions have for this word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, "those who use incantations." The Peshitta has <span class="accented">harasha</span>, primarily "one who is silent," then "one who mutters," then "one who sings an incantation." Paulus Tellensis has <span class="accented">lehasha</span>, "to whisper," and then "to reheat a charm" or "incautation." Jerome renders <span class="accented">arioli</span>," foretellers." While the Peshitta interprets <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> in Genesis by the same word as that used here, in the Septuagint the word in Genesis is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x1fde;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and Jerome uses <span class="accented">conjectores</span> instead of, as we have seen, <span class="accented">arioli</span> In <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a> <span class="accented">harturameem</span> is translated in the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. Jerome renders <span class="accented">ipsi</span>, as if the word had not been in his text. if, then, the word <span class="accented">hartummeem</span> stood in the text of Daniel when the Greek versions were made, there was an uncertainty as to the meaning to be assigned to it in Egypt. The distinction between the two meanings drawn from the etymology of the word <span class="accented">hartummeem</span>, and that derived from the  Greek equivalent, is not great. The religion of the Chaldeans was largely a system of incantations that were preserved primarily in the Accadian - a tongue known only to the sacred scribes. Many of the formulae are translated into Assyrian - a language, by the time of Nebuchadnezzar, practically as much restricted to the scribes and learned class as the Accadian. Hence only a scribe could know the proper words to use in an incantation, only he could perpetuate and preserve them. It is difficult to know on what grouted the translators of the Authorized Version selected the word "magicians." The Geneva Bible rendered it "enchanters," which is adopted by the Revisers. Luther is further afield in tendering <span class="accented">sternsehers.</span> The name is Assyrian, and apparently derived from <span class="accented">harutu</span>, "a staff" (Norris, 'Assyr. Dict.'). This staff was possibly used, as the staff of the Roman augur, to mark off the regions of the heavens, or, it may be, to ward off demons. <span class="accented">And the astrologers.</span> The Hebrew word used here is <span class="accented">ashshapheem.</span> "In Assyrian the word <span class="accented">asep</span> or <span class="accented">asipu</span> is used in the sense of diviner. The word was actually borrowed by the Aramaic of Daniel under the form of <span class="accented">ashshaph"</span> (Sayce, 'Hibbert Lecture,' p. 51). It is supposed to mean "one who uses enchantments." It is not Hebrew, but really Syriao or Eastern Aramaic. In both Greek versions the equivalent is <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, which Jerome follows. The Peshitta reserves <span class="accented">magoeha</span> for the next term. The assertion that this word was really the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span> is now abandoned. The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;</span> never rendered by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which represented a sound not present in Greek at all. The fact that this non-Hellenic sound is doubled makes it utterly impossible that this word could be brought over from the Greek. It is impossible to assign to this word the precise shade of meaning which belongs to it. There is nothing to suggest "astrologers" in the root of the word. <span class="accented">And the sorcerers.</span> The Hebrew here is <span class="accented">mekash</span>,<span class="accented">hepheem.</span> Dr. Robertson Smith, as quoted in Professor Bevan, suggests that the word is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5e4;</span>, "to shred or cut to pieces," hence "to prepare magical drugs." This is in agreement with the Greek versions, which render <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. The verb, however, is a Syrian one, and means "to worship" (<a href="../../par/acts/4-31.htm">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="../../par/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a>). It occurs in the Hebrew of <a href="../../par/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11</a> along with <span class="accented">hartummeem</span>; in <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>, in a verse forbidding to the Israelites the use of magical arts; in <a href="../../par/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>, in an account of how Manasseh traversed that law. It may be noted that in this last verse the Peshitta renders <span class="accented">Chaldea</span> "Chaldeans." Again we have to repeat the remark that we do not know the distinctions involved in these different names. <span class="accented">And the Chaldeans.</span> The Hebrew word here is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">Kas'deern</span>); both the form <span class="accented">Kassatu</span> and <span class="accented">Kaldu</span> occur in in-seriptions. The meaning of this word has caused great discussion, and its use in this chapter for a class of magicians has been held as a strong proof that the writer of the book before us lived long after the time in which he places the events he narrates. The use of "Chaldean" for "magician," "astrologer," or "soothsayer" in classic times is well known. The difficulty here is that the name "Chaldean" is used for a particular and limited class in the nation, and at the same time for that nation as a whole. This is not necessarily impossible. In Scotland, although the inhabitants are all called Scots, there is also the clan whose surname is Scott, or, as it was earlier spelt, "Scot." It would not show confusion or iguorance did a writer of the fifteenth century speak in one page of the Kers, the Hepburns, and the Scots (Scotts) as forming one army, and then in the next page proceed to speak of the whole army as the army of the Scots. His use of the name in the one case for the nation and the other for the clan, so far from showing an insufficient acquaintance with the constitution of Scotland, or the history of its affairs, really evidences the accuracy of the writer's knowledge. We cannot conclude that the author therefore made a mistake in speaking - if he does so - of a class of the Babylonian magians being called Chaldeans because the nation bore the same name. We certainly have as yet found no trace of such a usage, but the <span class="accented">argumentum e silentio</span> is of strikingly little value in regard to Babylon - her annals are so very incomplete. We retest bear in mind that the text of Daniel is in a very bad state: it has been subjected to various inter-polstions and alterations. It is, therefore, hazardous to rest any stress on single words. It is clear the writer knew perfectly well that the nation were called Chaldeans. According to the Massoretic text, <a href="../../par/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a> asserts, "In that night was Belshazzar King of the Chaldeans slain;" according to the LXX. version of the same verse it is, "And the kingdom was taken from the Chaldeans and given to the Medea and Persians." If we are sure the writer did make the Chaldeans also a class of magians, the probability is that he knew what he was talking about, and made no explanation because, as a contemporary, he took for granted everybody knew how this was. But is it absolutely certain that the writer of Daniel does make this asset-lion? It is true that in the Massoretic text the <span class="accented">Kasdeem</span> are represented as a class of magiaas coordinate with the <span class="accented">hartummeem,  ashshapheem</span>, and <span class="accented">mekashepheem</span>, but in the Septuagint we find the word <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> in the genitive. Consequently, the sentence reads, "the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers of the Chaldeans." If at the time the Massoretic recension was made the name "Chaldean" had gained its later significance of "soothsayer," one can easily understand how natural it would be to insert the copulative before the preposition. The construction of the sentence in the text before the translator of the LXX. Version is certainly irregular, but not unexampled. It is not so easy to imagine the Septuagint translator changing the nominative plural into a genitive, especially when, by the time the translation was made, the osage we have spoken of above was in full force. We may assume, then, that in the original text of Daniel the "Kasdeem" were not spoken of, in this verse at all events, as a class of magicians. As the clause appears in the LXX., Nebuchadnezzar assembled all the magicians of his nationality, the Chaldeans as distinguished from the Babylonians. Perhaps he had more confidence in them. While the change we have suggested would make only the <span class="accented">mekashshepheem</span> connected with the Chaldeans, the grammatical structure of the verse has the aspect of a freer rendering than that in Theodotion' hence it might quite well have been that the original Hebrew had the meaning represented by the Greek of the Septuagint. Lenormant   sees in the four classes here an exact representation of the four classes of Babylonian <span class="accented">soothsayers.</span> We do not feel obliged to maintain that all the different classes should be called in on the occasion of this dream. We do not know precisely the characteristics that separated one class from the other, but it seems little likely that they all devoted themselves to the interpretation of dreams. There were other omens and portents that had to be explained. <span class="accented">For to show the king his dreams.</span> The natural sense is that represented by the Greek versions, "to tell the king his dream." The usual reason for these officials being called was to declare to the king the interpretation of the dream; but here it was to declare the dream its. If. Yet if they could foretell the future, could they not much more easily tell what had happened? They professed to know what was coming; they could - so Nebuchadnezzar might argue - readily enough reason back from the future they knew to the sign of the future, the dream which had been given to him. <span class="accented">So they came and stood before the king.</span> We can imagine the long ranks of the principal <span class="accented">classes</span> of Chaldean <span class="accented">soothsayers</span> in Babylon hastening into the royal presence. All the soothsayers, we see, were not summoned, for Daniel and his friends were not, and they were not singular, else the writer would have given some reason for this omission. The writer assumes that his readers know so much about the habits of Bah;Ionian wise men and their schools, as to be aware that certain individuals might nominally be summoned to the court; and yet it might be some time before they were summoned on any critical occasion. The absence of the four Hebrews might be explained in two ways: either only the Chaldean magicians were in this case summoned, and, as Daniel and his friends were not Chaldeans, they were omitted; or they were not summoned he-cause their training was not yet complete. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-3.htm">Daniel 2:3</a></div><div class="verse">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</span> The Revised Version improves the English of the verse by putting the verb in the present, "My Spirit is troubled to know the dream." The Septuagint Version has the appearance of a paraphrase, "And the king said to them, I have seen a dream, and my spirit is troubled, and I desire to understand the dream." It is an unusual combination "to see a dream;" from its unusualness the reading of the Septuagint is to be preferred. In old Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">z</span>) are not unlike each other, nor are <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> (<span class="accented">m</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">y</span>). Yet these two, letters are the only differences between <span class="accented">halamti</span>, "I have dreamed." and <span class="accented">hazithi.</span> "I have seen." The Peshitta has <span class="accented">haloma hazith</span>, which gives the same combination, and would indicate that here too the Aramaic original is shining through It is however, difficult to see how such a word as <span class="accented">ahpatz.</span> "I wish," could drop out of the Massoretic. The must natural solution is that the translator added <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span> to complete the sense. Certainly a link is awanting as it stands in the ordinary interpretation of this verse. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, while the Vulgate paraphrases the last clause, "And the king said to them. I have seen a dream, and confused in mind I have forgot what I saw." The king has been perturbed by the dream, and his perturbation leads him to wish to knew the dream  - not necessarily what the dream actually had been, but what it meant. Thus in <a href="../../par/daniel/1-17.htm">Daniel 1:17</a> Daniel had understanding "in all visions and dreams;" this meant that he knew the meaning of dreams and visit us. The other versions give us no assistance to explain this. Archdeacon Rose says, "The king here plainly intimates that, though the dream had troubled and perplexed him. he could not remember what it was." It does not appear to us quite so plain It is certainly not impossible to imagine that, while  the king had been strongly affected by the dream, he might not remember distinctly what it was. If, however, he had no remembrance of the dream, and only the feeling of perturbation, any grandiose vision might have been brought before him, and he would not have been able to check it, or say that was not the dream he had had. If, again, he had some fragmentary remembrance, he naturally would have told what he remembered, in order that they might reconstruct his dream for him. Nebuchadnezzar's great purpose is not merely to see again his dream, but really to test these soothsayers that promised so much. If they could with such certainty as they professed tell what was about to happen, surely it was no great demand that they should know this dream of his. The king seems merely to have made the general statement, and left the soothsayers to tell at once the dream and interpretation. There sits the king with troubled brow, and there stand before him the principal adepts at interpretation of dreams. Some have found it a difficulty that God should reveal the future to a heathen monarch. But in the parallel case of Pharaoh this occurred; certainly the future revealed to him was the immediate future of the, land he ruled, whereas the dream of Nebuchadnezzar extended in its revelation to the very end of time. Archdeacon Rose refers to Pilate's wife and her mysterious dream at the trial of our Lord. The revelation as given to Nebuchadnezzar served a double purpose - it gave emphasis to it when, not an obscure Hebrew scholar got the vision, but the great conqueror; further, it gave an occasion for bringing Daniel into prominence, and gave thus to trim and to his companions an opportunity of showing their fidelity to God. This gave an occasion for miracles, the effect of which was to strengthen the Jews in their faith.

The name is simply the name of the nation, but is here used of this small portion of it that were soothsayers, in the same way as in <a href="../../par/john/9-22.htm">John 9:22</a> "Jews," the name of the nation, is used for the rulers: "For the Jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue." Hence it is needless to speak of' the Chaldeans being the principal class, and therefore "for the sake of breviloquence" (Moses Stuart) "put for the whole." So also Kliefoth ('Kom.,' p. 79), "Because the Chaldeans were the first class, they alone are named." The Chaldeans were not the inhabitants of Babylonia, but belonged to several cantons south and east of Babylon. <span class="accented">Spake.</span> The word <span class="accented">yedabberu</span> is usually followed by the verb <span class="accented">amar</span> in the infinitive. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/40-4.htm">Ezekiel 40:4</a> we have the verb <span class="accented">dibber</span> used without <span class="accented">arnar</span>, to introduce the thing said. It is not improbable that in this instance <span class="accented">Aramith</span>, "in the Syriac tongue," helped to the omission of <span class="accented">amar. In the Syriack</span> (<span class="accented">Aramith</span>). All scholars know now that there are two leading dialects of the Aramaean or Aramaic - the Eastern or Syriac, and the Western or Chaldee. The terms are very confusing; as Syria was certainly to the west of Chaldea, it seems strange that the usage should ever have sprung up to call the Western variety Chaldee, and the Eastern variety Syriac. The usage having been established, it has a certain convenience to be able to name all the Western, or, as they may be called, Palestinian dialects of Aramaic Chaldee, and all the Eastern varieties Syriac. While the English version uses the term "Syriac," as the portion of Daniel which follows has come down to us, it is not written in Syriac, but in Chaldee. We shall, however, endeavour to show that this is due to changes introduced by transcribers. As to the word <span class="accented">Aramith</span> occurring here, there is great force in the view maintained by Lenormant, that it is to be regarded as a note to the reader, indicating that st this point the Hebrew ceases and the Aramaic begins. The reason of the change from one language to another has been already dealt with in considering the question of the structure of Daniel. In the mean time it is sufficient to say that our theory is that the Hebrew in the beginning of Daniel is due to the editor, who collected the scattered fly-leaves. In the first chapter and in the three opening verses of that before us, we have the results of translation and condensation. As the previous sacred books had been written in Hebrew  - the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, not to speak of other books - it was natural that the editor, especially if he were under the influence of Ezra, would desire to see a book that had so much of holy hope and aspiration about it, in the sacred language of the patriarchs and prophets. There would be probably a considerable mass of irregular material to be gone over before a connected account could be given of the early days of Daniel. These sources would be necessarily in the main Aramaic, and hence the translation and condensation. It was formerly one of the objections urged against Daniel that the author regarded Aramaic  as the language spoken in Babylon. By this time the language engraved on the tablets had been discovered not to be any previously known toungue. It is now found that, although the inhabitants of Babylon used the cuneiform for inscriptions, the language of ordinary business and social intercourse was Aramaic. and had been for several centuries. Dr. Hugo Winckler says, in his 'History of Babylonia and Assyria,' p. 179, "Aramaic soon became the language of social intercourse (<span class="accented">ungangsprache</span>) in nearly the whole of Mesopotamia, and. expelled the Assyro-Babylonian, which continued only as a literary tongue (<span class="accented">schriftsprache</span>)." Bronze weights have been found dating back to the Sargo-nids, with the weight marked on the one side in Aramaic, while on the other the titles of the king are given in Assyrian, When Sennacherib sent Rabshakeh to Jerusalem, Eliakim and Shebna wished the conversation to be carried on in Aramaic, implying that by this time Aramaic had become the ordinary language of diplomacy. The single Aramaic verse in Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>) implies that the Jewish captives would be dwelling among a people who ordinarily spoke Aramaic. Some have deduced from the phrase, "then spake," etc., that Aramaic was not the ordinary language of the speakers - a deduction that would be plausible if it had not been that from this point till the end. of the seventh chapter the book is in Aramaic. Jephet-ibn-Ali thinks that Nebuchadnezzar had first addressed the wise men in some other language, and then betook him to Aramaic. O <span class="accented">king</span>, <span class="accented">live for ever</span>: <span class="accented">tell thy servaats the dream</span>, <span class="accented">andl we will show the interpretation.</span> The soothsayers address the king in terms of Oriental adulation. Similar phrases are found in despatches to Asshurbanipal. In the Septuagint Version the phrase is accommodated more to the Hellenic usage, and the king is addressed as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;</span>. Their language implies that they expected to be told the dream, and then, having been told the dream, they would apply the rules of their art to it, and declare to the king the interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a></div><div class="verse">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> The version of the LXX. has slight but important differences from the Massoretic text. It is as follows "And the king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if therefore ye do not tell me the dream truly and show me the interpretation thereof, ye shall be made an example of, and your goods shall be escheat to the royal treasury." Theodotion renders the last portion of the verse, "ye shall be destroyed (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), and your houses shall be plundered (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, but, like Theodotion, softens the last clause into "plundered." The Vulgate retains the fierceness of the <span class="accented">Massoretic</span>, softened merely in phrase, not in meaning. <span class="accented">The king answered and said to the Chaldeans</span>, <span class="accented">The thing is gone from me.</span> The first thing to be noticed is the difference of the Q'ri and the K'thib in the word "Chaldean;" it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, according to the Syriac usage, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> according to the Chaldee. As the Book of Daniel was copied and recopied many times, probably at least scores of' times before, on the latest assignable critic d date of Daniel, the Massoretic text was fixed, and copied mainly by those whose language was Western not Eastern Aramaic. the occurrence of Syriac forms is more likely to be survivals from a Syriac original than insertions, either accidental or intentional. When the differences are so slight as those between Eastern and Western Aramaic, the tendency is to remove them rather than to accentuate them. The older interpretation of <span class="accented">mill tha</span>, "<span class="accented">thing"</span> or "<span class="accented">word</span>," was to take it as referring to the dream - that it was the matter that had gone from him. This, however, depends to a large degree on the moaning to be attached to <span class="accented">ozda.</span> Is it to be regarded as equivalent to <span class="accented">azla</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> if it were derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, "to go;" or is <span class="accented">azda</span> to be regarded as Persian <span class="accented">azdu</span>, "sure," "diligent"? Delitzsch suggests <span class="accented">azanda.</span> "known." The two Greek versions render, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, a phrase which may either be "the word has gone from me," or "the matter has departed from me," the latter being the more natural, from the meaning of <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. The Peshitta rendering is, "Sure is the word I have spoken." The older commentators have mainly taken this sentence as asserting that Nebuchadnezzar had forgotten the dream; Calvin. however, does so only because he feels himself compelled to take ver. 8 as meaning this; while Jephet-ibn-Ali and others assume this to be the meaning of the phrase. Aben Ezra takes <span class="accented">azda</span> as meaning "firm" or sure. Berthohlt, among moderns, maintains that <span class="accented">millitha is</span> "the dream." Most others assert the sentence to mean, "The word which has gone forth from me is sure;" this is also Professor Bevan's interpretation. Hitzig's view here is peculiar: he would translate, "For the matter is important to me." This view does not suit ver. 8. The lexicons differ in this. Winer first gives <span class="accented">elapsus est</span>, <span class="accented">abiit</span>,  then adds, "unless rather it be derived from the Arabic  (<span class="accented">atzad</span>), 'strong,' or from the Rabbinic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, <span class="accented">robustus."</span> Buxtorf does give the alleged Rabbinic use of the verb, but gives reference only to occurrence in the passage before us and ver. 8, and renders <span class="accented">abire.</span> Gesenius renders, "to depart," and quotes in support of this the Rabbinic formula, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d8;&#x5e6;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "to go to one's own opinion," spoken of a rabbi who holds a view not shared by any other. At the same time, Gesenius gives a meaning to the clause as a whole which accords with that of most commentators, "The word has gone out from me." Furst takes the word as meaning "firm," "sure," "unalterable." He too quotes the Rabbinic formula, as if it confirmed his view, which really it does not. Castell gives  as <span class="accented">robur</span>, but appends no reference. Brockelmann does not give it at all, nor does Levy. Had Castell given any reference, it might have been argued to be a survival of a Syriac word through transcription; but we must remain in doubt in this, all the more so that the Peshitta does not transfer the word, which it would naturally have done had the word been extant in Syriac in A.D. . This would make it probable that it is an old word. The fact that it is used in Talmudic only in a formula, and then in a sense unsuitable to the present passage, confirms the idea of its age. It had probably a technical meaning, denoting that a certain matter was irrevocable. The Persian derivation of the word is by no means certain, though supported by Schrader and Noehleke. It may have a Shemitic root. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">azoz</span>) Assyrian (Schrader, 526), "to be <span class="accented">firm</span>," may be the <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> form of the word, which becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;</span> in Syriac, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> in <span class="accented">status emphatieus.</span> In Aramaic <span class="aramaic">&#x5d6;</span> of Hebrew becomes <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">zabab</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">dehab</span>), "gold." The Assyrian use of sibilants is more akin to Hebrew than to Aramaic. <span class="accented">Sa</span>, "this," is equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zeh</span>), Schrader, 'Keiln.,' 586. If <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d6;</span> were transferred from <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> and put in the <span class="accented">status emphaticus</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is not an unlikely form for it to assume. Even grant the word to be Persian, it is far from proving, or even rendering it probable, that Daniel was composed in the days of the Maccabees. There is no trace of Persian producing much effect on the language of the numerous peoples that were subject to the Persian empire. There is no sign that the word was known in Palestine during the time when the Targums were becoming fixed. In Alexandria, where the Septuagint version of Daniel was made, the meaning of the word was not known, and was thought to be equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>). In Asia Minor, where Theodotion made his version, it was unknown. Jerome, who made his version, if not in Palestine, yet under Pales-tinian guidance, translates it also as equivalent to <span class="accented">azal.</span> The natural conclusion is that this book must have been composed not later than the Persian period, and not far from the centre of government. As we have already said, our interpretation agrees with that of Professor Bevan; we would render the phrase, "<span class="accented">The</span> word which has gone forth from me," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, "is fixed." The reason of the king's refusal to tell the wise men his dream is that he cannot do it, net because he has forgotten it, but because he has already announced that he wishes these soothsayers to prove their ability to give the interpretation of the dream by telling him what the dream was which he had had. He has committed himself to that course; he is a king, and he may not change, <span class="accented">If ye will not make known to me the dream</span>, <span class="accented">with the interpretation thereof</span>, <span class="accented">ye shall be cut in pieces</span>, <span class="accented">and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> The king, unaccustomed to be opposed or refused anything, at once determines that it is not inability to tell him what he wishes to know that hinders the soothsayers, but unwillingness. Of course, the abruptness of the action, immediate sentence pronounced on their hesitating to satisfy his demand, seems improbable. We must, however, remember that we have the account given us in the utmost brevity. We have the substance of the dialogue between the king and his astrologers. It is put in dialogue form simply because the Shemitic tongues naturally lend themselves to this mode of presentation. The sentence, "ye shall be cut in pieces," suggests some of the punishments inflicted by Asshurbanipal on those who rebelled against him. In the Aramaic the meaning literally is, "Ye shall be made pieces of." This is considerably softened in both the Greek versions. In the LXX. the rendering <span class="accented">is</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye shall be made an example of." Theodotion renders, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, "Ye shall be for destruction." The Peshitta is stronger, if anything, from the succession of words, "Piece piece ye shall be cut." The punishment certainly was horrible, but not more so than the punishment David inflicted on the murderers of Ishbosheth. Indeed, in European countries a century and a half ago punishments yet more revolting were frequent. The punishment for treason in our own country was as horrible as anything well could be. The sentence, however, went further than merely the individuals. <span class="accented">And your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span> In the 'Records of the Past,' 1:27, 43, are references to something  like this. "houses reduced to heaps of rubbish." That the houses thus made heaps of rubbish should therefore be made dunghills, is in perfect accordance with the manners at present holding in the East. The rendering of the Septuagint is very peculiar here, "<span class="accented">And</span> your goods shall be escheat to tire royal treasury (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." This cannot be due to any desire to soften the meaning, for in the first place, in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/daniel/7.htm">Daniel 7</a>:29, where the same phrase occurs in the Aramaic, it is paraphrased, but not really changed; it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. But further, the meaning here is perfectly different from that in the Aramaic of the Masse,retie recension. Theodotion's rendering is a softening of the Massoretic, "Your houses shall be (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) torn down;" but the Septuagint quite changes the meaning. If the translator had a slightly blurred copy before him, he might read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span>; that is to say, instead of "a dunghill," he read it as the third person plural pael of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>), "<span class="accented">to go."</span> When written in Sama-titan characters, or in old Phoenican characters, the last word would not be unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5da;</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> the king." This is the only explanation of this variation that seems feasible, and it implies that the manuscript before the Septuagint translator was written in Eastern, not Western Aramaic. The pre-formative <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, used as the sign of the third person, is the peculiarity of Eastern Aramaic. The translator must have bad this generally before him in his manuscript, or he never could have made this mistake. This is another indication that the Aramaic of Daniel was originally not Chaldee, but Syriac. We can imagine the striking scene: on the one wide the haughty young conqueror, blazing in indignation at the obstinate refusal, as he counts it, of his soothsayers and augurs to tell him his dream and the meaning of it; on the other, the crouching crowd of magicians, astrologers, and oneiromantists, dispirited and nonplussed. Brought up in an absolute faith in astrology and augury, the king never doubted their ability to tell him his dream; it could only be a treasonable desire to hinder him from taking the suitable steps to avoid whatever danger might be threatened by it, or to gain whatever advantage might be promised. They would not tell him the dream, because by their rules the interpretation would be fixed, and from that they could I not escape. The king will not and cannot reverse his word, and they cannot tell him what he desires, and so they stand facing each other. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-6.htm">Daniel 2:6</a></div><div class="verse">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if ye show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof</span>. The Septuagint Version is "If ye will show me the dream, and tell me its interpretation, ye shall receive every sort (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>) of gifts, and be honoured by me: show me the dream, and judge." There are indications of differences in the text, which are considered below. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic in its rendering of this verse. The Peshitta also manifests no serious difference. All these older ver<span class="accented">sions</span> render it doubtful whether <span class="accented">nebizba</span> was part of the original text. <span class="accented">But if ye show the dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the interpretation thereof</span>, <span class="accented">ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards a</span>n<span class="accented">d great honour.</span> Ewald would conjoin with this verse the latter part of the verse preceding, with considerable justification. Like the latter part of the previous verse, it is to be taken as the summation of a long argument, in which threats and promises would bear a large part, probably both heightening as they failed to produce tire effect required of making the soothsayers reproduce to Nebuchadnezzar his dream. Now the acme is reached - on the one hand, a death of torture and infamy is threatened; on the other band, in the verse before us, "gifts, rewards, and great honour." The king is eager to have his dream interpreted, but he has taken his stand - before he will listen to the interpretation, they must afford him evidence that they can interpret correctly this dream, by reproducing it to him. One of the words here has been used by Berthohlt as evidence that the Book of Daniel originated in the days of the Maccabees, when Greek was largely spoken. The word translated "<span class="accented">reward"</span> in our version is <span class="accented">nebizba</span>; this, it was argued by Bertholdt, is <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">m</span> becoming <span class="accented">b</span> - a not infrequent commutation. In support of this, if we take <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> as meaning "coined money," this would make a distinction between this word and <span class="accented">matnan</span>, the more ordinary word for "a <span class="accented">girt."</span> Jephet-ibn-Ali translates in accordance with this meaning: "I will give you raiment and dinars," he makes Nebuchadnezzar say. Yet this view is now abandoned by all critics, and however many alleged Greek words are found in Daniel, this is never now brought forward as one of them. Lexicographers are practically unanimous in rejecting this derivation. There are two other derivations, one making it a palpel form of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;</span> with a <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> pre-formative which was Gesenius's view in his 'Thesaurus.' He later abandoned this view, and maintained that it was connected with some Persian root. Winer maintains the former of these views, and Furst the latter. As a Persian word, it  is supposed to prove the late date of Daniel. It does seem somewhat strange logic to argue, from the presence of Persian words in a document, that therefore it was written late in the Greek period. The prior question presents itself - Is the word Persian, Greek, or Aramaic, really a part of the original text of Daniel? In regard to this the Septuagint Version is of importance. Its rendering of this clause is, as we have seen, "But if ye shall show me the dream, and tell me the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive all manner of gifts, and shall be honoured by me." This interpretation implies a different text - the word <span class="accented">nebizba</span> disappears from the text altogether, for no one would translate it <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>; evidently the translator had before him some combination of <span class="accented">col</span>, "all." The combination <span class="accented">matnan nebizba</span> occurs in the Targum in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/40-5.htm">Jeremiah 40:5</a>, therefore, had it been present, the translator would have been aware of its meaning. Theodotion renders it <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c2;</span>. If the phrase occurred elsewhere, there would easily be a motive to introduce the word <span class="accented">nebizba</span>, but there seems none to substitute for it another word altogether; certainly <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unfrequently confounded, and a defective <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> might be read as a <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>. It would not be difficult to reproduce a Hebrew sentence, the rendering of which would require <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. This much is clear <span class="accented">- nebizba</span> was not before the Septuagint translator. It is further to be observed that the Septuagint translator has had before him, not the noun <span class="accented">yeqar</span>, "honour," but the verb in the passive or ethpael. These, however, are not all the points where the Septuagintal text must have differed from the text we have received from the Massoretes. The adjective <span class="accented">sagi</span>," great," occurs in the Authorized Version, but is not represented in the Septuagint. The order of the Greek words suggests a different order in the original Aramaic. Other things being equal, the strutter a reading, the more likely it is to be the original reading. It is clear that this advantage is with the Septuagint reading. If there were any likelihood of certain words being omitted from any probable cause as homoioteleuton, it would be different. On the other hand, the addition of a kind which is frequently seen, the more recent word <span class="accented">nebizba</span> is put alongside its more ancient equivalents. In the other case, the adjective <span class="accented">sagi</span>, "great," is inserted, as frequently happens, with a view of heightening the effect. Another explanation may be suggested. We know the Aramaic docquets on the back of the contract tablets are written in a script resembling Phoenician characters. If the original manuscripts were written at the date assigned by tradition, then it would be written in this style of letter. In it we find that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> were liable to be mistaken, as also; and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span>; we should then have <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">minni</span>), "from <span class="accented">me</span>," as a possible reading which had been rot,read by some Palestinian scribe into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">sagi</span>), "<span class="accented">great</span>," and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> added to complete the word. The case is only a familiar case of doublets. When we have further <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;</span>, "from me," the change of the preceding is thus in a sense necessitated. This may be regarded as an indication of age, as the square character had begun at least a century before Christ (Driver,' Samuel,' p. 21.). This leaves but little time for modifications and blunders of penmanship between this and the critical date of Daniel. The latter clause of this verse shows us another variation between the Massoretic text and that lying behind the Septuagint. The Massoretic recension is well represented in the Authorized Version. <span class="accented">Therefore show me the dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the interpretation thereof.</span> The version of the Septuagint indicates a different reading, and has a different point, "Declare to me the dream, and judge." According to the Massoretic reading, the king merely repeats his demands, the only reference to the preceding promises and threatenings being in the conjunction <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lahen</span>), "therefore." Whereas the main reference of the clause, according to the Septuagint, is to the immediately preceding promises, "Show me the dream, and judge if I will do as I have said." Another supposition possible is that there has been a transposition. In the very next verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hevah</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> represented by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;</span> - in that case it may mean "interpret," the rendering then would be, "Show me the dream and interpret," and represent some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e9;&#x5e8;</span>, only there is the awkwardness of using the same word as equivalent to two different Aramaic words in contiguous verses. The difference is not of great importance; the king is eager to get the magicians to tell him his dream and its interpretation, but, having commenced the experiment as to their powers, he will not allow himself to be driven from it. Before leaving this verse, we must note the presence of certain signs of old date in the Aramaic of the passage. First, the word <span class="accented">hen</span>, "if," is not used in the Targums; it is not in Levy's Dictionary; neither Gesenius nor Furst gives any non-Biblical reference for the use of the word In the same way, its derivative <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lahen</span>), "therefore," is equally peculiar to Biblical Aramaic.  Particles are good notes of age, as they are less liable to change than nouns substantive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-7.htm">Daniel 2:7</a></div><div class="verse">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</span> The Septuagint Version here is, "And they answered the second time, saying, O king, tell the dream, and thy servants will judge of these things." Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. The wise men are unable to satisfy the king's demands. Ewald comments on the fact that none of them had the inventiveness to make up a dream, and tell the king that had been his dream. He admits himself that there might have been risk of the king discovering the deception, if no flash of reviving memory in his mind answered to their invention. On our hypothesis that the king had not forgotten his dream, but was testing their powers, it was not only in the highest degree hazardous, but it was certain of failure. They must have known the case to be as we imagine it, or, when they were sentenced to death, they would have run the hazard, on the plea, "If we perish, we perish." There was a chance, though a faint one, of success in the attempt to palm off upon the king their own imaginings for his dream; there was a certainty of death if they did nothing. All they can do, however, is simply to repeat what they before said, "Tell us the dream, and we will find the interpretation of it." Nebuchadnezzar has often been denounced as specially foolish and tyrannical on account of this demand which he made of the wise men; but tyrannical though he was, and foolish though he seems at times, looked at from our elevation, this demand of his is not an example either of his folly or his tyranny. These soothsayers enjoyed great honour and great revenues, on the assumption that they possessed certain powers of foreseeing the future. He demands of them, instead of an enigmatical statement of what was coming on the earth, that they tell him what he had dreamed. They professed to be able to discover thefts, and where stolen property was; they professed to point out men who were devising evil against another. If their claims were true, they could surely tell the king his dream. They were thus employed and honoured in order that they should foretell to the king any fortune, good or bad, impending himself or the natron. His dream presumably foretold the future; they affirmed that they knew the future; they surely might tell the king what prophecy was made to him in his dream. Believing in the reality of their powers with all the faith of a fanatic, their refusal could only mean to him treason. They did not tell him his dream, not because they could not, but because they would not, in order that the disaster - for such he would be sure the dream portended - might not be averted by timely sacrifices. If the elaborate treatises on magic and divination which have come to us, so far as has been discovered, only in fragments, were complete, it is not impossible that we might be able to tell what interpretation these wise men would have put on the dream, had they been told it. It would be a curious exercise, for certainly Daniel's interpretation would not be the result. We must return to the versions for a little, in one respect the Septuagint is closer to the Massoretic than Theodotion, by having <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, the participle, instead of <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. We direct attention to this, with a view to the phenomenon we find in the succeeding clause. The Septuagint rendering is given above. The most noticeable thing which the reader will find about this rendering is the change of person in the last clause. As it stands in the Massoretic text, it is certainly the first person plural Imperfect pael of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>; but in Syriac the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> was the sign of the third person in the imperfect, as well as of the first person plural; hence, if there were a little uncertainty as to the end of the word, it was an easy mistake to one who was reading from a manuscript in Eastern Aramaic, but an impossible one for a scribe translating from a manuscript written in Chaldee, or Western Aramaic. It cannot be urged plausibly that the change might simply result from a free translation, for the slavish accuracy of the rest of the verse precludes that escape. As the reading of the Greek is confirmed by the version of Paulus Tel-lensis, the probability is slight of a various reading. This is another evidence that Daniel was originally written in Eastern, not Western Aramaic. It may be observed that while in the Massoretic text the verb "tell" (<span class="accented">y'emar</span>) is put in the imperfect, in the Septuagint it is translated as it' it were. imperative. The difference between the third person imperfect and the second person imperative is the presence, in the case of the former, of the preformative y (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span>), which is absent in the other. That is a thing that might easily happen, that, (<span class="accented">yodh</span>) might be dropped or inserted mistakenly; consequently, this affords no evidence that the Septuagint translator took liberties with his text. The question may be put, how tar these soothsayers knew they were impostors. Most likely they were unconscious of anything approaching imposition. We know the elaborate rules by which they determined the exact meaning of every  sign and portent. We know how prone men are to supplement such rules by a native faculty for foreseeing what is likely to happen, and how, further, explanations may be devised to save the credit of these canons of interpretation, even when most hopelessly proved to be false by events. Archdeacon Rose appeals to modern <span class="accented">spiritualists</span> as examples in point, regarding both the Chaldean soothsayers and modern spiritualists as equally impostors. We feel inclined to regard them as so far alike in this - that most of both classes imposed most on themselves. The presence of these false prophets is an evidence of the existence of the true prophets at some time, at all events; there would be no counterfeit coin were there no genuine money. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-8.htm">Daniel 2:8</a></div><div class="verse">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</span> The versions here do not differ in any essential point. The king now becomes certain of the treasonable purpose of the soothsayers. The word <span class="accented">zeban</span> means not so much "gain" as "purchase," "barter." To the king the meaning of their obstinate refusal to submit to his requirements is that they know that some great advantage may be gained by the king, or some great disaster forefended, if he only knows the meaning of this dream, and that if the king does not submit to them and yield up his decree, and, putting his pride under his feet, tell them the dream, the time when its revelation may be taken advantage of may be passed. In these matters everything was supposed to depend on the thing to be done being done precisely at the right conjunction of the planets. His last utterance seems almost to rise to agony, "Because ye see the thing is fixed away from me!" We have the same word (<span class="accented">azda</span>) translated here, as in the fifth verse, "gone." As we saw above, its real meaning is rather "fixed," "settled," "determined." His decree had gone out, and he would not - nay, so strongly had he willed at that it was as it' he could not - alter his decision. It has been regarded as bearing on this passage that St. Paul (<a href="../../par/ephesians/5-16.htm">Ephesians 5:16</a>) uses the same word as that by which the Greek versions translate <span class="accented">zeban</span>, "redeeming the time, because the days are evil." The meaning of the apostle is to some extent in contrast to that here. Believers are, as it were, to purchase the time from the evil days. Nebuchadnezzar thought the astrologers were, as it were, meaning by their delays to buy the auspicious moment for the kingdom from under his feet. It is a mistaken idea that he thought they merely wished to gain time. It would I seem, from what we read further of his treatment of Daniel's request lot time, that, had they merely asked for time, Nebuchadnezzar would have granted their request. He had staked his faith in their ability to unfold any mystery on this one test, and they seemed to him obstinately to refuse to submit to it. To believe them unable to reveal the truth that he wished, would be to overturn all the fabric of his faith in the religion of <span class="accented">his</span> fathers; therefore, with all the strength of a strong man. and all the blind faith of a fanatic, he will not acknowledge the inability of the soothsayers to tell him his dream; it must be obstinacy, he thinks, that prevents the soothsayers telling him, and that obstinacy must have a sinister purpose. There is a clause in the Septuagint completing this verse, but it is not parallel with any clause in the Massoretic text: "Then just as I have ordered, thus shall it be." This probably is an alternative rendering. <span class="accented">Azda is</span> taken in what is now regarded as its meaning - "that which is fixed," or "decreed," in which case this final clause might be rendered, "What is fixed from me is a decree;" and of this the above-mentioned clause is a somewhat free rendering. This interpretation of the clause confirms our view of the situation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9</a></div><div class="verse">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, <i>there is but</i> one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you.</span> The words translated (<span class="accented">di hen</span>) "but it'" liar, caused some difference, most translating as if the first word were not present. This is the rendering of the Septuagint. Theodotion and Jerome render the first word, which is really the relative, as "therefore," e<span class="accented">rgo</span>, "then," <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>. The Peshitta has <span class="accented">den</span>, the corresponding Syriac phrase, which has a similar <span class="accented">sense</span> to that assumed here. The rendering of the next clause, both in the Septuagint and in the version of Theodotion, differs considerably from the Massoretic text. The rendering of the Septuagint is as follows: "If ye do not truly tell me the dream, an,l show me the interpretation, ye shall die." The version of Theodotion is shorter, "It, then, ye will not tell me the dream." Theodotion thus omits the clause translated, "there is <span class="accented">but one decree for you</span>;" the only word that may be the remains of it is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5ea;</span>, or simply the participle, The Syriac is, "If ye will not declare the dream to me, one is your plan and your word." The text of the Septuagint in this case indicates that we have here additions from previous verses. The phrase, "and declare to me the interpretation," is evidently supplied from ver. 5, whereas "ye shall die." literally, "ye shall chance to (fall into) death," has a different origin. This phrase has all the appearance of a translation. It would seem applicable on the idea that in the text before the Septuagint  translator, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">datheon</span>), "your decree," there stood <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">motheon</span>), "your death," the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) being omitted, and possibly the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> (be), and <span class="accented">milch</span> being read into some part of <span class="accented">nephal</span>, "to fall," probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">tippelun</span>). The omission of this clause, as above mentioned, from Theodotion renders it a little doubtful, as it indicates that in the text used by the Jews of Asia Minor this phrase was awanting. Most commentators take <span class="accented">dath</span> in the sense more common in Eastern than in Western Aramaic, of "pica" rather than "decree" Ewald and Professor Bevan oppose this view, as also Keil, the last with great positiveness. The facts that so many commentators give this meaning, and that certain Rabbinic authorities reterred to but not named by Jephet-ibn-Ali prove it to be no impossible translation. Hitzig, Von Lengerke, Maurer, Michaelis, and Moses Stuart are not quite despicable. The main reason against this view is that in Western Aramaic <span class="accented">dath</span> means "decree," in Eastern Aramaic it means, according to Castell, <span class="accented">scopus</span>, <span class="accented">meta</span>, <span class="accented">finis</span>, <span class="accented">voluntas.</span> The only difficulty is that he gives no reference, and Brockel-mann gives only <span class="accented">lex</span>, which in this case it cannot be, though this is the only reference beside Hoffmann's 'Glossary.' It might be an individual "decree," but a "law" it cannot be. On the received renderings the succession is somewhat violent. "If ye will not tell me the dream, one is your decree," can only be made consecutive by a violent jerk away back to the fifth verse. It seems more natural to take it as meaning, "Ye have agreed together to say one thing to me." The accusation of conspiracy naturally followed from the king's firm conviction that the soothsayers could tell, if they only would, what he required of them. If there began to dawn upon him any idea that their silence was due to inability to answer, it might well move him to redoubled anger that they had been guilty of imposture in claiming such lofty powers and being so highly paid and honoured for their exercise. The king's mind had not yet abandoned the faith of his fathers in magic and divination. For ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me. It' the Septuagint is to be taken as our guide, the word <span class="accented">shheethah</span> is a doubtful addition to the Massoretic text It is, however, in the other later versions. According to the rendering of both the Greek versions, the meaning here is stronger than that which is expressed in the Authorized Version; <span class="accented">hizdaminton</span> really means "to conspire." He will not admit the plea of inability to satisfy his demands - the vague suspicion may be floating before his mind - as, if he were to admit their inability to satisfy what he wished to learn, then, according to his logic, all their claims were false. Hence the accusation of "lying and corrupt words" would still stand, and have all the greater emphasis. Waiving the question of the authenticity of "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," the distinction between the two words "<span class="accented">lying"</span> and "corrupt" seems to be in this: the first refers to the person addressed  - to Nebuchadnezzar, - the words are untrue, they are lies - as coming from the soothsayers they are "<span class="accented">corrupt</span>," because they are symptomatic of a corrupt disposition, probably traitor, us. Till the time be changed. Theodotion renders here. "till the time be passed." The Septuagint follows a similar reading to that in the Massoretic text. The Peshitta rendering is akin to that of Theodotion. While in all forms of magic and soothsaying, time was an element not to be neglected, it was doubly important in regard to astrology, and an hour or two changed the position of the moon in relation to the constellations. If something required to be clone in consequence of this dream, then most likely it would require to be done in a certain relation of the heavenly bodies to each other. Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me the interpretation thereof. The Septuagint rendering is paraphrastic, "Now then, if ye tell me the thing which I saw in the night, I shall know that ye can also show the interpretation." While we have called it a paraphrase as regards the Massoretic text, the rendering in the Septuagint may represent the Egyptian recension of the text of Daniel. The use of <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> or "thing" suggests translation, and assumes <span class="accented">millah</span> or <span class="accented">mill'tha</span>, which has the same double suggestion of "word spoken" and "thing spoken about." If the Septuagint text were assumed here, we should have confirmation of our view that Nebuchadnezzar remembered his vision, but was determined to experiment on the soothsayers of his court. This view is certainly implied in the following clause. The first word of this clause is peculiar grammatically: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">in'd'a</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;</span> ('<span class="accented">iyda</span>) or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> ('idda). This form of compensating for a dropped consonant by inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> (<span class="accented">nun</span>) instead of doubling occurs elsewhere in Biblical Aramaic (see ver. 30). This is rare in Syriac, and in the Targums found only in those later, especially those of the Megilloth, which have affinities with the form of Aramaic seen in the Babylonian Talmud. This peculiarity is common in the Maudaitic dialect. It is thus a distinctively Eastern form of Aramaic that is indicated here. When we pass beyond the grammatical elements, we find that Nebuchadnezzar would take correct information  as to what he had dreamed a guarantee of the correctness of the interpretation of the dream which the soothsayers might afterwards give him. His attitude was purely and truly scientific, as it is stated. In his own mind he was warped and confused by his overmastering belief in omens and auguries, in gods and demons, in magicians and astrologers. With this faith in his heart, his only explanation of the silence of these soothsayers was treason. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-10.htm">Daniel 2:10</a></div><div class="verse">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore <i>there is</i> no king, lord, nor ruler, <i>that</i> asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean.</span> It is to be noted, in the first place, that we have the same Syriac form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>. This seems to us a survival from an earlier condition of the text, when the Syriac forms were predominant, if not universal, in it. Scribes accustomed to speak and write in Chaldee would naturally harmonize the text to the language they were accustomed to use. The word "saying" ("and said," Authorized Version) is omitted from the. Septuagint, but it is found in all other versions: its omission in the Septuagint may have been due to error - the Aramaic is not complete without it. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">la-'itha</span>), "there is not." The ordinary Targumic and Talmudic usage is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">layith</span>), "is not." one word. This full way of writing this negative form is an undeniable proof of antiquity. Neither Levy nor Castell gives any example of the full writing which is the regular practice in Biblical Aramaic. Merx, 'Chrestomath. Targ.,' 168, 225, also gives only <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>. As a rule, the fuller a form is, the older it is. <span class="accented">Earth</span>; literally, <span class="accented">dry groined-</span> the same word as is used in the Targum of Genesis, "Let the <span class="accented">dry land</span> appear," but not the usual word for "the world." Theodotion, in accordance, translates <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; the LXX. renders merely, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta has  (<span class="accented">ar'a</span>). The <span class="accented">king's matter</span> (<span class="accented">mil-lath malea</span>); literally, <span class="accented">the king's word</span>, which, consequently, Theodotion translates <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. The LXX renders, "to tell the king that which he has seen." It is evident that he read <span class="accented">milbdh</span>, as it' derived from <span class="accented">melal</span>, "to speak," as <span class="accented">lemallala.</span> The rendering, "that which he has seen," is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">l</span>) into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">d</span>); the verb <span class="accented">heva</span> was read <span class="accented">heza</span>, and then the change in meaning be. conies intelligible. <span class="accented">Therefore there is no king</span>, <span class="accented">lord</span>, <span class="accented">nor ruler.</span> The mote natural interpretation of the Aramaic is, "There is no king great and powerful." Some have regarded <span class="accented">ral</span>, <span class="accented">ushlat</span> as a title of the King of Babylon, but this does not seem to be borne out by inscriptions. The sense is rather that of 1he marginal rendering, "There is no king be he never so great and powerful." Then-dotion has this reading. The Septuagint renders, "<span class="accented">no</span> king and no ruler (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x2e;&#x2e;&#x2e;</span><span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span>)," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">eol</span>) for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">rab</span>). The Peshitta follows the Massoretic closely here. In this connection, it may be observed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shaleet</span>) is not frequent in the Targums, but it occurs in the Peshitta. <span class="accented">That asked such things. Kidnah</span>, "like this." This form of the demonstration, ending with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">h</span>), instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, is regarded as older than the Targumic form. Theodotion inserts <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> here. A<span class="accented">t any magician</span>, <span class="accented">or astrologer</span>, <span class="accented">or Chaldean.</span> The first thing that strikes the reader of the Aramaic, and for that matter the other versions, is the omission of one of the classes of soothsayers - that called "sorcerers" in our Authorized Version. We saw that, according to the Septuagint, the" Chaldeans" were not a separate college of augurs or soothsayers. When we look atlentively at the Aramaic, the reason of the presence of "Chaldeans" here, and the absence of "sorcerers" becomes probable. In the first place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e9;&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is written without the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, as singular. When so written, its resemblance to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">mekashshaph</span>) suggests the question whether there might not be, occupying this place, an Aramaic noun equivalent to <span class="accented">ashshaph</span>, which we see is really Assyrian, and, interpreting it we find <span class="accented">mekashshaph</span> put thus after <span class="accented">ashshaph</span> elsewhere, but omitted here. The solution of' the omission of <span class="accented">mekashshaph is</span> the likeness the latter part of the word bears to <span class="accented">Kusdt</span>, especially in the script of Egypt, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> were very like each other. These assembled wise men protest against the test to which the king would put them as essentially unfair. They had been trained to divine the future from dreams, but never to find out dreams by what they had learned from their airs the future would be; and in proof of this they urge that no king, however great, had made such a demand of any astrologer or soothsayer. Nay, they go further, and say that no man upon the earth is able to tell the king what he wishes. They endeavour to make the king see that what he asks is an impossibility. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-11.htm">Daniel 2:11</a></div><div class="verse">And <i>it is</i> a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it is a rare thing that the king requireth</span>. The Septuagint Version of this passage is, "The thing which thou requirest, O king, is hard and strange." The last two winds are most likely a case of doublet - two different renderings of the same Aramaic wind, <span class="accented">yakkirah.</span> The primary meaning of this word is "heavy," and by transference it becomes "difficult," and then, "strange" or "rare." There may  have been a slight difference of reading to account for the sentence taking the vocative term it does. It may be due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d3;&#x5e8;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e8;</span> in the following clause. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. and translates <span class="accented">yakkirah</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta does not differ here from the Massoretic text. The soothsayers still pursue their line of defence, which they had adopted in the preceding verse. The king cannot get the answer he demands - his demand is so difficult and strange. And there is none ether that can show it before the king except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. The Septuagint rendering (lifters somewhat, though slightly, from the Massoretic text: "And there is no one who will show these things to the king, unless some (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) angel, whose dwelling is not at all with flesh." The omission <span class="accented">of ahoran</span>, "other," gives some slight confirmation of the suggestion that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "strange" or "peculiar," represents it. It is very characteristic of the time when the Septuagint translation was made, and of the opinions then current, that the, word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">elohin</span>), "gods," should be rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "angels" By this time there was an avoidance of the use of the Divine name, and anything that suggested it; further, there was an avoidance of the names of heathen deities. The same feeling that makes the historian of the Book of Samuel represent (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>) Achish swearing by Jehovah rather than by his own gods, as would certainly be the case, makes the translator here represent the soothsayers referring to "angels." The idea of angels of the nations, which we find later in this book, was generally adopted by the Jews in Egypt (as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, LXX.). A question has been raised here as to whether the statement, "whose dwelling is not with flesh," is to be regarded as distinguishing all gods from human beings, or as distinguishing certain of the higher gods from the others. The first view is that of Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Bevan, and others; Professor Fuller and Von Lengerke and others maintain the latter opinion. There is one thing certain - that the soothsayers and interpreters of dreams and auguries believed, or, at all events, pretended they believed, themselves each under the guidance of a special <span class="accented">genius</span> or subordinate god. Such a god had his dwelling with flesh - that is to say, with humanity; but there were in their pantheon higher gods, whose dwelling was not with flesh. In some of the incantations and magical formulas which Lenormant has collected in his 'La Magie,' we find (p. 21) Selek-Moulou-ki coming to Ea his father for information as to the causes of disease, etc. Marduk is the Babylonian name for Selek-Moulou-ki, and Marduk was the great revealer; but by this his dwelling was with flesh. As we see, however, there were gods whose dwelling was not with flesh, who knew secrets hid even from Marduk. This excuse of the wise men is a preparation for Daniel's claim to raveal the secret of the king by the power of a higher God than any that communicated with the Babylonian soothsayers. Hitzig regards this as an artistic device of the author. We regard it as the providential intervention of God himself, that raise heathen soothsayers should shelter themselves under an excuse that forced into clearer light the supremacy of Jehovah. It <span class="accented">indicates a</span> special knowledge of Babylonian worship thus to lay stress on this distinction between higher and lower gods. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-12.htm">Daniel 2:12</a></div><div class="verse">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon</span>. The Septuagint rendering differs little in sense from the above, but in words it does considerably, "Then the king, becoming gloomy and very grieved, commanded that they lead out all the wise men of Babylonia." The main thing to be observed is the softening of the meaning in the hands of the Septuagint translator. This is so great as to suggest that he read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. The aphel of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> is not used in Chaldee, but is used in Syriac. Theodotion's rendering is, "Then the king in anger and wrath commanded to destroy all the wise meal of Babylon." The Syriac has a shade of difference, "Then was the king vehemently enraged, and in great fury commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon." It is evident that Theodotion read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">benas</span>), "was angry," as if it were the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> and the Syriac noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> (has), "anger." He also must have inserted the preposition before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">qetzaph</span>), "wrath;" in this he is followed by the Peshitta. The Septuagint is freer in its rendering in this <span class="accented">verse</span>, and one cannot argue anything from it. The probability seems to be that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span>; (<span class="accented">nas</span>) is used as a noun, and that the Targamic verb was formed from the mistake of a scribe dropping the preposition before <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">qetzaph</span>). If we are correct in this, we have an additional evidence that the original languagge of Daniel was not Chaldee, but Syriac, or, at all events, Eastern Aramaic. As a grammatical note, we direct attention to the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, where the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> of the root has totally disappeared before the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> of the haphel, the equivalent in Biblical Aramaic of the Chaldee and Syriac aphel with its preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x20;</span>. Professor Bevan says that  this distinction is only a matter of orthography. Are we to deduce that Professor Bevan has a cockney disregard for <span class="accented">h</span>s? The writer now drops reference to special classes of wise men, and names them generally <span class="accented">hakeemin.</span> The king is unconvinced of the truth of these wise men (<span class="accented">hakeemin</span>), or rather he is convinced that they are traitors and deceivers. They are either concealing from him the knowledge they have, and are, therefore, traitors to him; or the gods have withdrawn from them, and therefore they must have been untrue to the gods. On both these grounds Nebuchadnezzar thinks them worthy of death. He at once issues the decree that all the wise men in the city of Babylon should be slain. If the LXX. reading of <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a> be correct, he had only summoned the Chaldean wise men. If all the wise men of Babylon were ordered to be slain, the punishment is extended beyond the offence. Possibly he argued, "If even my fellow-countrymen, the Chaldeans, are traitors, much more will the Babylonians be so." So far as words go, it is doubtful whether this decree applies to the province of Babylonia, as the Septuagint translator thinks, or merely to those in the city. But cruel and furious as was the young conqueror, he was scarcely likely to order the wholesale massacre of those who, in Sippara and Borsippa, had neither refused to do what he wished, nor by implication called him an unreasonable tyrant, as had the wise men in Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-13.htm">Daniel 2:13</a></div><div class="verse">And the decree went forth that the wise <i>men</i> should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain.</span> As the Aramaic stands, it might be translated as does Professor Fuller, "And the decree went forth, and the wise men were being slain;" the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> of co-ordination maybe regarded as here used of Subordination. Further, the use of the participle for the preterite is not by any means uncommon in Daniel, certainly mainly in the principal clause, as in ver. 5 of the present chapter. Noldeke, in his 'Syriac Grammar,' 278<span class="accented">a</span>, gives examples of the passive participle being used as here in the subordinate clause. The Septuagint is very condensed, but possibly drawn from a similar text, only such extreme condensation is unlike the translator elsewhere. It is possible that some part of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>. (<span class="accented">peqad</span>), "to decree," was used, perhaps the participle hithpael. It is possible that the verb <span class="accented">qetal</span> was in the infinitive. Theodotion renders, "And the decree went forth, and the wise men were slain." This, though a possible translation, does not fit what we find represented to be the circumstances, as ver. 24 seems to assume that the wise men were not yet destroyed. On the other hand, it would be hardly possible to imagine the king allowing these wise men who had refused to answer his question, to go out of his presence in safety and unbound. It would seem more natural to imagine that they were carried off to prison, and that all the soothsaying class were intended to be gathered together in prison, in order that the vengeance of the king might be more appallingly manifest. The sentence looks at first sight to us as too savage to be true, but just as savage proofs of vengeance were given by Asshurbanipal. <span class="cmt_word">And they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain</span>. The Septuagint translation of this clause is somewhat paraphrastic, "And Daniel was sought for and all those with him in order to be put to death." The want of an antecedent to fix the nominative of the verb probably led to the sentence assuming its present mould; but "all" seems to have no word to occasion it. Theodotion follows the Massoretic text closely; so also does the Peshitta. It is clear from this that Daniel and his companions had not been summoned into the royal presence when the question concerning the dream was put to the wise men. This would seem to contradict the statement of <a href="../../par/daniel/1-19.htm">Daniel 1:19</a>, "Therefore stood they"  - to wit these Hebrew youths <span class="accented">-</span> "before the king." Their position was probably like those who had passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service - they are accepted, but they have still a season of study, and then, after they go out to India, they occupy only subordinate situations at first. While permited to enter the ranks of the soothsayers and astrologers to the court, they were placed at first only in the lower grades, and would have to rise by degrees, and in ordinary circumstances a long time would elapse before they would be summoned into the immediate presence of the sovereign. On the reading of the LXX., Daniel and his friends would not, because they were Jews, and not Chaldeans. One has only to turn to the Talumdic tales to see how unlike this reasonable position is to the ordinary Jewish fictitious narrative. The Book of Daniel is not nearly prodigal enough in wonders to be a representative of the Jewish Midrash. It is further clear that the decree of the king went beyond those who had actually been in his council-chamber on that merest-able day. The idea of the king probably was that the treason which he had found in the heads of the various classes of Chaldean soothsayers would have permeated all the members. Babylonian and foreign, as well; therefore he orders them all to suffer a common fate. Wieseler's hypothesis, that this event took place close to the end of the three years of study which had been assigned to these youths, would suit the  statement of events which we find here; although it is not necessary, yet on this assumption, the succession of events as narrated in this chapter becomes perfectly natural. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-14.htm">Daniel 2:14</a></div><div class="verse">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.</span> The text here does not seem to have differed much from the Egyptian recension, the translation of which we have in the Septuagint Version. "Then Daniel spake with the counsel and knowledge which were his to Arioch the chief executioner [<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;</span>, 'chief butcher,' used by Plutarch for 'chief cook'] of the king, to whom it was appointed to lead out the wise men (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>) of Babylonia." The text before the Septuagint translators seems to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">deeleh</span>), "which to him," equivalent to "which he had." The LXX. text had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e4;&#x5e7;</span>. Something may be said for this reading, as the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> of the succeeding word may have occasioned the disappearance of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>, which might be regarded as a <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> defectively written. Theodotion agrees perfectly with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is somewhat of a paraphrase in regard to the first clause, "Then Daniel pacified and consulted, and said to Arioch the chief of the king's guard, who had gone out to slay the wise men of Babylon." It would seem as if there had been some confusion of the words here, though the meaning is not far from that of the other version. The Vulgate Version differs, "Then Daniel asked about the law and sentence (<span class="accented">sentientia</span>) at Arioch, who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon." The slate of matters implied here reveals to us the fact that several links of the story are awanting. There seems to have been absolute secrecy as to what had taken place in the royal council-chamber, and how absolute had been the failure of the Chaldean wise men to satisfy the demands of the king. We could imagine the strange turmoil that this would have caused in the college of young cadets of the various guilds of soothsayers and augurs, had it been announced that these great heads of their various orders had failed. News may have come of the wrath of the king, and close behind the angry sentence of extirpation, passed not only on those who had been the immediate occasions of the king's wrath, but on all the gull, is of wise men in Babylon. This must have filled those who belonged to the various guilds implicated, not only with terror, but with amazement. It was next brought to them that they, though only in the lower stages of these famous guilds, were doomed to a common destruction with the past masters of the craft. That this was allowed to reach these subalterns proves that popular opinion had not gone with the fiery edict of the king. Above all, Arioch, captain "of the guard" - "of the cut-throats," as the Spanish translators have rendered it; "chief butcher," as both Theodotion and the Septuagint render his title - acts as if he is not in favour of it. lie is compelled to do the king's bidding; but he is evidently bent on going about the realtor in such a leisurely fashion that the great body of the condemned may escape. We may stay to notice that the name Arioch is a genuine Babylonian name, <span class="accented">Eri Aku</span>, "Servant of the moon-god." Professor Bevan declares it is borrowed from <a href="../../par/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>, as his title is from <a href="../../par/genesis/37-36.htm">Genesis 37:36</a>. It is singular that when the author's acquaintance with the earlier Scriptures was so full and accurate, he should drop into the blunders he is accused cf. In Genesis the executioner does not execute anybody; in Daniel he is represented as engaged in organizing the massacre. Daniel seems not to have waited till the terrible band of guardsmen-executioners arrived at the college where he and his friends were living, he goes direct to the chief of the band. The fact that he is not cut down immediately on his approach seems to argue that even the common guardsmen shrank from the duty imposed on them. Their horror and shrinking were perfectly natural. Let us suppose a company in a regiment of Irish Roman Catholics ordered to shoot down their own priests, and we may have some idea of the feelings of these soldiers. These augurs and soothsayers, these astrologers and magicians, had been their counsellors; they had been their intercessors with their deities. If they were all slaughtered, would not the sheer blank in their own lives be immense? There would be no one now to tell them, however falsely, of the future: no one to tell them what to do to propitiate the gods. But more, the gods might well be supposed to be enraged by the slaughter of so many of their special servants, and might be expected to pour down vengeance on the whole nation as well as on the king who had commanded it, but most of all on those who, under whatever compulsion, raised their sacrilegious hands against the priests of the holy gods. It is even not improbable that, once the immediate paroxysm of his fury had passed, Nebuchadnezzar would be appalled at what he had himself ordered, and would connive at delay, in the hope that, though late, these wise men might come to reason and tell him what he wished. Daniel seems to find  no difficulty in gaining access to the presence of Arioch. There are men who have a magnetic power over their fellows, and bend every one to their way, and still gain their affection. And Daniel seems pre-eminently to have been a man of this type. Personal good looks and suave manners had their own share, but something more was needed to carry a condemned man through the ranks of guards right into the presence of their chief. This is made all the more striking when we bear in mind that preparations were being made for the great massacre. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-15.htm">Daniel 2:15</a></div><div class="verse">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why <i>is</i> the decree <i>so</i> hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel</span>. The opening clause in this verse is doubtful. In the Septuagint the verse is rendered, "And he asked him saying, Ruler, why is it decreed so bitterly by the king? And he showed him the warrant." Theodotion is yet briefer, "Ruler of the king, why has so harsh a sentence come forth from the king? And he declared (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) to him his orders." But briefest of all is the Peshitta. It begins at once without any address, "Why is this harsh decree from the king? And Arioch showed the matter (<span class="accented">miltha</span>) to Daniel." As a rule, the shorter a reading is the better it is. Therefore we are inclined to prefer the Peshitta rendering. "Answered and said" is a formula that might easily be stuck in where anything of the kind seemed needed. Here it is not suitable, as Daniel is already said to have "answered Arioch with counsel and prudence." The addition of the Septuagint is more reasonable, "He asked him saying, Ruler." Theodotion feels some title is necessary, so he calls Arioch "ruler of the king." It appears to us that the brief Peshitta represents the best text. <span class="accented">Hasty</span> repesents to some extent, though not fully, the clement of blame implied in the word <span class="accented">mehahetzpah</span> in greater degree than our English word would indicate. It means" rough," "raging," "shameless;" it might be too strong to say that "scandalous" represents Daniel's meaning. Some commentators cannot imagine a man thus criticizing a royal decree to one of the court officials. Much, however, is permitted to a man speaking about a decree which has condemned him to death without his having an opportunity to defend himself It is possible that he might be able to use all the more freedom by seeing that Arioch had no favour for the business to which he was ordered. The Greek versions represent that Arioch showed the warrant, the king's order for the execution. As that would not be considered an answer to Daniel's question, on the one hand, so on the other, it would not be an occasion for the step Daniel immediately thereafter took. We think, on the whole, that the Massoretic reading amended here by the Peshitta is the better. As leader of the royal bodyguard, the place of Arioch would be beside Nebuchadnezzar, even in the council-chamber. He would thus be quite cognizant of everything that took place the demands of the king, the arguments of the wise men. All this scene he could portray for the information of Daniel. The mere exhibition of a warrant would tell nothing more than the fact that the action of Arioch was in obedience to orders. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-16.htm">Daniel 2:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation</span>. The version of Theodotion omits all mention of Daniel's going into the palace, "And Daniel petitioned the king that he should give him time, and he would tell his interpretation to the king." The rendering of the Peshitta agrees with this, "And Daniel petitioned the king for time, and he would show the interpretation to the king." The version of the Septuagint is longer, "And Daniel went in quickly to the king, and petitioned that time should be given him from the king, and he would show all things to the king." Jerome gives a rendering of the Massoretic text in Latin condensation. The question of reading here is of some importance in the light of the apparent contradiction implied in the twenty-fifth verse. There Arioch declares that he "had found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation" <span class="accented">-</span> as if Nebuchadnezzar had never seen him before, whereas, if the Massoretic recension is correct, Nebuchadnezzar had seen Daniel but a little while before. According to the reading of Theodotion and the Peshitta, Daniel pet:tinned the king for time, but that petition does not imply necessarily that he was admitted into the king's presence; the petition would pass through court officials, and reach the king in due course. We may note the ease with which he granted this request, and look upon it as confirmatory of our notion that the king, now that his rage had gone down, repented of his harsh decree, and was hoping against hope that the catastrophe would be averted. The only other explanation that would save the authenticity of both passages is that Daniel's entrance into the palace and his petition to the king happened without Arioch being aware. The most natural explanation of Arioch's conduct in post-poning the execution of the royal decree is that the postponement was during the  interval the petition for time was being presented, but still not decided on. This seems not unlikely. Of course, it is always open to us to declare the verses from this to the twenty-fourth inclusive an interpolation; Daniel has suffered so much from this, that an additional case has no <span class="accented">prima facie</span> probability against it. Moreover, the prayer or hymn has strong resemblance to the prayer of Azarias, which is acknowledged to be an interpolation. Still, one ought to be slow to cut a knot in this way, unless there is some clear ground of suspicion. It may be observed also that the Massoretic text does not necessarily assert entrance into the palace or into the king's presence. Certainly <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>: ('<span class="accented">alal</span>) means "entered," and in the connection this would suggest the palace as the place entered, but it may have been the house of Arioch, though this is not likely. We have no means of knowing whether any others of those implicated in the sentence of the king petitioned also for time. Not impossibly they did. The king, who was so suspicious that the wise men wished to delay till the auspicious time was passed, is willing to grant time when it is asked. This is explicable on the idea that Nebuchadnezzar was anxious to be delivered from the horrible slaughter which his decree involved. Another thing to be observed is that in the Massoretic text, Theodotion, and the Peshitta, there is no word of the dream being told. Of course, this interpretation implied a knowledge of the dream also, but it would appear to be another evidence that the king was relenting, when a petition that omitted the crucial point of the question between him and the wise men should be granted without difficulty. We are not told the amount of time requested, the word used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">zeman</span>), is, "a fixed time," from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>, "to determine." It occurs again frequently in Daniel, as in ver. 21. It is generally of a fixed point of time, but sometimes, as <a href="../../par/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a>, their lives were prolonged for a season (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>). There being only one instance among the other passages where this word occurs, in which it means a space of time, we are inclined to think that here Daniel petitioned that a time be appointed him when he too should have an audience of the king in regard to the matter of the dream, as the other wise men had. There certainly is implied a space of time in this request. The space must have involved at least twenty-four hours, as the matter is revealed to Daniel in "a night vision." It is unlikely it would be much longer, for fear the planetary collocation would change - certainly not more than a week. Tertullian ('Adv. Psychicos,' 7) says, "Daniel <span class="accented">Deo fidens</span>...  spatium tridui <span class="accented">poslulat."</span> We learn from what follows that Daniel acted tamely from his general faith in God, and was confident that God would not suffer his saints to be destroyed causelessly, it is noted by Calvin that Daniel (lees not tell the king the reasons of his confidence. <span class="accented">A falsarius</span> would have taken the opportunity of making Daniel declare his confidence in the God of heaven from the very first. The real Daniel acts as any wise saint would do, confident that God would do justly, hopeful that he would reveal to him the secret, yet too careful of the honour of Jehovah to put it in pledge; he knew God could and would defend his own honour, and his plan might not involve the saving of their lives. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-17.htm">Daniel 2:17</a></div><div class="verse">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions</span>. There is nothing in the versions that calls for remark here, save that the Septuagint seems to have had <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, "all," or some such word, instead of <span class="accented">mill'tha.</span> Alter having got his petition granted, to all appearance easily, Daniel now proceeds to his own house. As during the period of their education the four friends had formed one "mess" in the hall of Nebuchadnezzar, and it is probable had one table set apart to them, so when in college - if we may use the phrase - they occupied one apartment or set of apartments. Their life in the matter of food was simple and abstemious, and it is little likely that they would require extensive accommodation. Having got the reprieve he had petitioned for, Daniel now informs his friends of it. We have assumed that the news of the royal decree had reached the college where, among other students and soothsayers of as yet lesser grade, Daniel and his friends abode; in that case, he would merely have to inform them how he had sped with Arioch. and how he had further presented a petition to the king tbr a time to be set when he should answer the king's request, and how he got what he desired. It may, however, have been that Daniel had alone heard the dreadful news, and then acted so that his companions heard only of the threatened disaster when they heard of the mode of escape. It is to be observed, in passing, that the names of the friends are given in the Hebrew, not in the Babylonian form. Alone with each other, we may imagine they  used the old Hebrew names of their childhood. Now especially would the sacred tongue be present to their lips and their thoughts when the cloud of a great danger hung over them. It was as Jews, members of the holy people, that they could appeal for help and deliverance to Jehovah the God of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-18.htm">Daniel 2:18</a></div><div class="verse">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span> The Septuagint has as close a connection between the preceding verse and that before us as has the Massoretie, only it is slightly different in its rendering, "And he told them to fast and pray [urged them to fasting and prayer], and to seek help from the Lord the Highest, concerning this mystery, in order that Daniel with his companions might not be given over to destruction with the wise men of Babylon." It is, certainly, possible that the Septuagint translator had a different reading here. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, "to fast," in the infinitive, might have begun the verse. Still there would be the difficulty of finding anything to correspond to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>. It, however, was probably added to bring the sentence into Greek regimen. The Septuagint translator read the words as nouns in the accusative, and of this case <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> was a frequent sign. Thus what they had was <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>. The Hebrew word corresponding to the Aramaic word here translated "mercies," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">rahamin</span>), "bowels," "mercies," is common enough in Biblical language; but the phrase, "to desire mercies," is not found elsewhere in Scripture. It occurs in the later Targums, as <a href="../../par/numbers/12-13.htm">Numbers 12:13</a>, as a paraphrastic addition to the simple statement of Onkelos, that Moses prayed before the Lord; only in the case quoted, as generally, the order is not, as here, the object before the verb - a construction more frequent in Assyrian than in Aramaic, save in poetry. The phrase is elliptical; the ruling verb is omitted. One is tempted to wonder whether the word had not originally been <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, making it a case of the Babylonian or Eastern Aramaic, third person plural imperfect; then the preceding word would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, with the <span class="accented">vav</span> dropped as unnecessary, and the mere inserted to make the word a regular infinitive. Confirmatory of our view is Theodotion, whose rendering, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;</span>, implies that he had a third person plural imperfect here. We do not maintain that it is necessary that he should have had such a reading, but there is at least a high probability that he had. The Peshitta reverses the order of the words, and omits the conjunction <span class="accented">vav</span>, and, inserting the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, as sign of subordination, proceeds, "that they entreat mercies from before God." Here, also, the third person plural imperfect is used. From the greater freedom that Jerome allowed himself in his translation, and from the wide difference between the grammatical construction of a Latin and an Aramaic sentence, no stress can be laid on the fact that he too translates by the third plural imperfect - <span class="accented">ut quaerrent misericordiam.</span> The balance of probability is that here we have to do with one of those indications of the Eastern origin of the Aramaic of Daniel. There is an instance of doublet in the LXX. here in the case of the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to seek succour." Tertullian, in his reference to this passage, to which we have referred above (ver. 16), adds to what we quoted above, <span class="accented">cum sua fraternitate jejunat</span>, and thus shows that, though differing somewhat from the Septuagint text as we have it, the African Latin Version agreed with it in inserting something about "fasting" here. <span class="accented">The God of heaven.</span> This is rendered by the Septuagint here, as generally, <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> The probability here is that we have to do with no difference of reading, but rather with an objection to applying to God a title used for heathen deities. The title has a peculiar significance in the lips of those who, as Daniel, were educated as astrologers, and taught by those who regarded the sun, the moon, and the various planets as deities. Daniel and his fellows might thus believe in astrology, but maintain that the God of heaven, their God, used heavenly bodies as messengers to proclaim to those who could read the writing, the things that were coming on the earth. They might thus even give a certain limited subordinate power to the deities of Babylon; these deities were the servants of the God of heaven, who was also the God of Israel. There may be a reference to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-11.htm">Jeremiah 10:11</a>. <span class="accented">The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth</span>, <span class="accented">even they shall perish from the earth</span>, <span class="accented">and from under these heavens.</span> The God of Israel is called the God of heaven because he has made the heavens. This title is used before - in <a href="../../par/genesis/24-7.htm">Genesis 24:7</a>, where Abraham uses it. It is characteristic of Biblical Aramaic, that the covenant title of God, "Jehovah," is never used, Before we leave this, we would observe that the Peshitta inserts <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>, d, the sign of the genitive, before <span class="accented">shemayyaa</span>, whereas the text before us uses the older form of construct state in the word for "God." <span class="accented">Concerning this secret. A</span> parallel passage illustrative of this is <a href="../../par/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord God will do  nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets; "also <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>, "Secret <span class="accented">things</span> belong unto the Lord our God." Whatever was about to happen, Daniel and his friends knew it could only happen according to the purpose and plan of God. He, as he was the real actor, knew what he was about to do, and whatever revelation of that future had been given to Nebuchadnezzar in his dream, it must have come from the God of heaven; therefore to him do Daniel and his friends make their entreaty. Professor Bevan declares <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;</span> (<span class="accented">raz</span>) to be a Persian word. Neither Winer, Furst, nor Gesenius recognizes it to be such. Granted that it is Persian, is it not a possible supposition that it is derived from the Aramaic; not that the Aramaic word is derived from the Persian? Even on the supposition that this word was derived from the Persian, this is not extraordinary, when we learn the intimate relationship between the Median court and the Babylonian. <span class="accented">That Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span> Does this mean that certain of the wise men had already perished? It seems almost necessary to maintain this from the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shear</span>), "remnant." It seems at first scarcely natural to take this word as meaning merely "the other," yet the usage in Ezra is in accordance with this: <a href="../../par/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a>, "Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>) of their companions." A further question may be raised - Does this prayer mean that the desire of Daniel and his friends was that, when the wise men of Babylon, under whose superintendence they had been taught, were slain, they should escape? Or does it mean that they prayed that "they with the wise men of Babylon should not be destroyed"? This wholly depends on the meaning to be attached to the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> ('<span class="accented">im</span>), "with." As in English, this word admits of both meanings. As the word is common to Hebrew and Aramaic, we shall take our examples from Hebrew. Thus <a href="../../par/genesis/18-24.htm">Genesis 18:24</a>, "That be far from thee, Lord, to slay the righteous <span class="accented">with</span> the wicked." As example of the other use of the word, <a href="../../par/genesis/32-6.htm">Genesis 32:6</a>, "Esau and four hundred men <span class="accented">with</span> him." Usage thus permits us to regard this prayer as intercessory, that these Hebrew youths prayed not only to be preserved themselves, but also that all the other wise men who shared their condemnation should also be preserved. This is the first record of concerted prayer. Of course, in heathen worship there was the caricature of this concert of prayer in the united shouting of the priests, say, of Baal. This is the earliest instance of that practice that has received such a gracious promise from our Lord (<a href="../../par/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19</a>), "If two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven." We would not maintain, even in appearance, that multitude adds to efficacy with God. But when two or three are gathered together, there is an infection of earnestness, a community of enthusiasm generated, that makes each individual fitter to receive the answer. Yet, again, the more that join in a petition, the more it must be raised out of the grovelling region of selfishness. A man who has a purely selfish desire rising in his heart cannot ask his fellows to join him in supplicating God to grant his request. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a></div><div class="verse">Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.

This may be held to be implied in the Aramaic, but it is here explicitly stated. Further, the Septuagint speaks of the secret as "the, mystery of the king." At the end of the clause the LXX. adds the word <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "evidently." All these alterations imply additions to the text made by the translator. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and Jerome agree with the Massoretic text There has been considerable discussion as to whether this revelation was made to Daniel by a dream. Hitzig assumes that the night-vision to Daniel was a repetition of that which had appeared to Nebuchadnezzar, and then pro-coeds to brand this as a psychological impossibility. Keil, Kliefoth, Kraniehfeld, and Zockler all declare against the identification of a night-vision with a dream. Keil and Kliefoth say in the same words, "A vision of the night is simply a vision which any one receives during the night whilst he is awake." And Kranichfeld says, "Of a dream of Daniel, in our present case there is not one word." Zockler says, "Not a dream-vision, but an appearance (<span class="accented">Gesicht</span>) vision, which appeared during the night." They maintain that, though all "<span class="accented">dreams"</span> may be called "<span class="accented">night-visions</span>," all "night-visions" are not "<span class="accented">dreams."</span> It would be difficult to prove that this is the usage of <span class="accented">Scripture.</span> It is quite true that the distinction between a dream and a vision is that in the former the subject is asleep, while in the latter he is awake. It may, however, be doubted whether this distinction is always maintained by the Hebrew and Aramaic writers, even in regard to "visions" and "dreams" generally; and it seems to us impossible to prove it in regard to "visions of the night" and "dreams." In ver. 28 of the chapter before us, there seems no doubt that Daniel uses these words  as equivalent to each other; "Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these." While we agree with Hitzig that the revelation was to Daniel in a dream, we do not admit the <span class="accented">psychological</span> impossibility, save only in the pedantic sense in which it is said that no two people, however close they may stand to each other, see the same rainbow Dreams are very generally the product of what the subject has experienced during his waking hours. Surely Hitzig never meant to assert that it was a psychological impossibility for two individuals to witness the same event. Certainly the improbability is very great that the sight of the same physical event should meet the eyes of two people in similar states of body, and produce on them precisely the some sort and degree of impression. That, however, is akin to the Hegelian pedantic statement, which asserts that we cannot go twice down the same street. Though it might even be admitted to be an impossibility in the only sense in which it can at all be admitted, yet still it is not self-contradictory. The self-contradictory is the only impossibility we can assert in the presence of the miraculous. Hitzig's objection to this is really that it was a miracle, and all the parade of giving the statement a new face by calling it, not a miracle, but a psychological impossibility, is only throwing dust in the eyes of others, perhaps of himself. Ewald does not see any psychological impossibility, and declares that the author meant to represent this at all events. Up, then, before the mind of Daniel rose the gigantic statue of the monarch's vision, and with the vision came also the divinely given certainty that this was what the king had seen. He needs, however, more than the vision: the interpretation of the vision is vouchsafed to him also. <span class="accented">Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</span> The LXX. rendering here joins the first clause of ver. 20 to this, "Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven, and having cried aloud, said." Theodotion, the Peshitta, and Jerome agree with the Massoretic text. As we have said above, Daniel returned thanks to God for his great goodness to him and his friends. Our blessing God does not increase Divine felicity, but it expresses our sense of this felicity, and we recognize it all the more readily when, as in the case of these Jews, it is exhibited in making us partakers of it. Hence blessing God and giving God thanks become in such cases one and the mine thing.

Probably there was a transposition of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5da;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d0;</span> and the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5df;</span> omitted.

Theodotion differs somewhat more from the Massoretic text than is his custom, "And he said, Be the Name of God blessed from eternity to eternity, for (the) wisdom and (the) understanding are his." This is shorter; the omission of the pleonastic formula, "answered and said," has an appearance of genuineness that is impressive. It would seem as if Theodotion had <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">beenetha</span>), "<span class="accented">understanding</span>," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">geboorah</span>), "might." The Peshitta and the Vulgate do not differ from the Massoretic text. The first, word of the Hebrew text of this song of thanksgiving has an interest for us, as throwing light on the question of the original language, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> has the appearance of an infinitive, but it is the third person plural of the imperfect; <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> is here the preformative of the third person singular and plural as in Eastern Aramaic as distinct from Western. This preformative is found occasionally in the Aramaic of the Babylonian Talmud, along with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, the preformative we find regularly in Syriac. In Biblical Aramaic this pre-formative is found only with the substantive verb; the reason of this, however, we have considered in regard to the language (see Introduction, p. 23.). Suffice it that we regard this as an evidence that Daniel was originally written in Eastern Aramaic. Professor Bevan's explanation, that the phenomenon is due to the likeness these parts of this verb have to the Divine Name, is of force to afford a reason why, in the midst of the general process of Occidentalizing the Aramaic, they shrank from applying it to this verb. That they had no scruple in writing it first hand, we find in the Targums; thus Onkelos, <a href="../../par/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span>. We might refer to ether examples in the later Aramaic of the Talmud and other Rabbinic works. <span class="accented">The Name of God.</span> Later Judaism, to avoid using the sacred covenant name of God, was accustomed to use the "Name," in this sense. This may be noted that throughout this whole book, "Jehovah" occurs only in ch. 9. This may  be due to something of that reverence which has led the Jews for centuries to avoid pronouncing the sacred name, and to use instead, <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, "Lord." It is to be observed that all through Daniel the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the Greek equivalent for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, while Theodotion follows the Massoretic in having <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. For <span class="accented">ever and ever.</span> This is not an accurate translation, although it appears not only in the Authorized, but also in the Revised Version. The sound of the phrase impresses us with a sense of grandeur, perhaps due to the music with which it has been associated. When we think of the meaning we really give to the phrase, or of its actual grammatical sense, it only conveys to us the idea of unending future duration; it does not at all imply unbeginning duration. More correct is Luther's "veto Ewigkeit zu Ewigkeit." The Greek of Theodotion conveys this also, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Jerome renders, "a saeculo et usque in saeculum." The true rendering is, "from eternity to eternity." It is quite true that the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> means primarily "an age," as does also <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="accented">saculum</span>: it is also quite true that it is improbable that in ancient days man had definite ideas of eternity; even at the present time, when men strive after definiteness, they have no real conception of unending existence, still less of existence unbeginning. Still, it was used as having that meaning so far as men were able to apprehend it. As <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, it is used for "world." <span class="accented">For wisdom and wight are his.</span> Wisdom is the Divine quality of which they have had proof now, but "might" is united with it as really one in thought. The fact that the usual combination is "wisdom and understanding" (see <a href="../../par/exodus/31-3.htm">Exodus 31:3</a>; <a href="../../par/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-4.htm">Ezekiel 28:4</a>) has led the scribe, whose text Theodotion used, to replace "might" by "understanding." He might feel himself confirmed in his emendation by the fact that, while God's wisdom and, it might be said, his understanding were exhibited in thus revealing to Daniel the royal dream, there was no place for "might." What was in the mind of Daniel and his friends was that they were in the hands of a great Monarch, who was practically omnipotent. They now make known their recognition of the glorious truth that not only does the wisdom of the wise belong to God, but also the might of the strong. Further, there is another thought here which is present in all Scripture - that wisdom and might are really two sides of one and the same thing; hence a truth is proved by a miracle, a work of power. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a></div><div class="verse">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding</span>. In regard to this verse, Theodotion and the Septuagint only differ in this from the Massoretic text, that they omit the repetition of the word "kings." The Peshitta has a different sense in the middle clause. "He maketh (Peshitta, <span class="accented">ma'bed</span>) kings and confirmeth (Peshitta, <span class="accented">maqeem</span>) kings" The Syriac translators have evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">meh</span> '<span class="accented">deh</span>), "to remove," as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">meha'bed</span>), "<span class="accented">to</span> make" The utter want of contrast in this reading condemns it. In regard to the Aramaic of this passage, the carrying on of the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>, the sign of the haphel conjugation, is a proof of the early date of the Aramaic. In later Aramaic, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> gives place to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> disappears after the other preformative as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. <span class="accented">Changeth times and seasons.</span> Nebuchadnezzar was anxious lest the time in which he might make advantageous use of the information conveyed by the dream should pass away, and a new "time" be established. Not improbably Nebuchadnezzar, like most heathens, imagined that his gods were limited by some unseen power like the Greek Fate, and, however wishful they might be to be propitious to their worshippers only in certain collocations of the heavenly bodies could they carry out their wish. God, the God of heaven, the God of the despised Hebrews, he it was who arranged the times and the seasons, he made the sun to rise, he makes summer and winter, he leads out the host of the stars, alike the star of Nebo and the star of Marduk. The two words "time" and "season" are nearly synonymous. Perhaps the first is more indefinite than the other. Our own opinion is that the first has more the idea of space of time, and the latter more of point of time; but really they are almost synonymous. <span class="accented">He removeth kings</span>, <span class="accented">and setteth up kings.</span> In this there seems to be a special reference to the contents of the vision, which showed that in the time to come, not only kings but dynasties were to be set up and overthrown. The former clause regarded God as the God of nature. This looks u pen him as the God of providence, by whom "kings reign, and princes decree justice." <span class="accented">He giveth wisdom unto the wise</span>, <span class="accented">and knowledge to them that know understand-lag.</span> This address to God goes further. Daniel sees in the faculties and mental acquirements of men the manifestation of God. It is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding. All the power man has of acquiring knowledge, all the faculty he has for using that knowledge aright, all come from God. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a></div><div class="verse">He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what <i>is</i> in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He revealeth the deep and secret things; he knoweth what is in the darkness,</span>  <span class="cmt_word">and the light dwelleth with him</span>. The rendering of the Septuagint as it stands differs somewhat from the Massoretic text, "Revealing deep things and dark, and knowing the things which are in the darkness and the things which are in the light, and with him is a dwelling-place (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." There is doubt as to the exact force of this last word; the last element in it suggests "solution." This meaning seems to have been given to it generally; for Paulus Tellensis renders it <span class="accented">shari</span>, which means a "solution," but as it is derived from <span class="accented">shera</span>, which means "to dwell," he retains the double meaning The reading of Kreysig is decidedly to be preferred, omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> ("the things which") before "in the light," and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, "and," after. The rendering then would be, "in light is with him the dwelling-place." This rendering harmonizes the LXX. completely with the Massoretic. The other versions call for no remark. There is difference here between the Q'rl and K'thib. The Q'ri reads <span class="accented">nehora</span>, "light," a Chaldee or Western Aramaic form; the K'thib again is, <span class="accented">neheera</span>, the Eastern Aramaic form. God is not only the God of nature, of providence, and of man, but also of revelation. He can make known to man what otherwise man could never know. He is the very Source of all light and enlightenment. We may compare this statement with that of Paul in <a href="../../par/1_timothy/6-16.htm">1 Timothy 6:16</a>; he speaks of God as "dwelling in light which no man can approach unto." It seems to us the words of the Old Testament song convey a loftier idea of God than does the Pauline statement - perhaps it is even loftier than the cognate phrase of the Apostle John (<a href="../../par/1_john/1-5.htm">1 John 1:5</a>), "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all." We may compare, in regard to this whole verse, <a href="../../par/psalms/139-12.htm">Psalm 139:12</a>, "The darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the tight are both alike to thee," where <span class="accented">neheera</span> is used as in the passage before us. Daniel ascribes to Jehovah all the powers of all the gods of Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-23.htm">Daniel 2:23</a></div><div class="verse">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast <i>now</i> made known unto us the king's matter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee; for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.</span> The Septuagint renders, "Thee, O Lord of my fathers, i thank and praise, because thou gavest wisdom and knowledge to me, and now thou hast revealed to me what I entreated, in order to show the king concerning these things." There seems a slight difference of reading implied here. Theodotion and the Peshitta are practically at one with the Massoretic. Theodotion translates the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> as if it were "and," not, as in our version, "for;" and the Peshitta repeats the first personal pronoun. Daniel now particularizes his reasons for praise and thanksgiving. He addresses God as the God of his fathers. He appeals to him as the covenant God of Israel, who had led their fathers through the wilderness. God revealed himself to Jacob at Bethel as "the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac." So to Moses at the burning bush he declared himself "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God. of Jacob." On the other hand, when Jacob approached God in prayer, he addressed him as "the God of my father Abraham, and the God of my father Isaac." God had shown kindness to his fathers: would he not also show kindness to their seed after them? <span class="accented">Who hast given me wisdom and might.</span> As <span class="accented">Jacob</span> in his prayer at Mahanaim (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-9.htm">Genesis 32:9</a>) not only pleads with God as the God of his fathers, but also as the God who had blessed him with his guidance before, so Daniel now further addresses God who had bestowed upon him "wisdom and might." When God has bestowed upon any one special faculties, he must presumably have a special work for him, rid it is therefore reasonable to plead with God to give an opportunity for the exercise of these special powers. Here it forms an occasion of thanksgiving. We are apt to forget that our powers, mental and physical, our <span class="accented">possessions</span> and acquirements, are gifts of God's grace for which we owe thanks. The special reason for gratitude, however, follows - God has answered the prayer of his servants. <span class="accented">Hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee.</span> It is to be noted that Daniel attributes the answer not merely to his own prayer, but to the united prayer of his three friends as well. Their earnest desire had gone along with his own in calling down the Divine answer. Daniel, while giving thanks for the knowledge vouchsafed to him, recognizes the help his friends had afforded. <span class="accented">For</span> <span class="accented">thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</span> Daniel assigns the reason here for his thanksgiving  yet more definitely. God had made known to him what the king had required. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-24.htm">Daniel 2:24</a></div><div class="verse">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise <i>men</i> of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch. whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation</span>. The differences in the versions from this are slight. The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, an emendation due to the fact that the king had demanded from the wise men, not merely the interpretation, which, given the dream, they were willing enough to give, but the dream itself; only the more natural emendation would have been to have interpolated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, (<span class="accented">hel'ma</span>), "dream," be fore "interpretation." Both the Septuagint and Theodotion omit the word representing the second "went." It is to be observed that "went in" and "went" are different words in the original, as in the Peshitta Version. The verbs <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">alal</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">azal</span>) have different ideas connected with them. The first means "to enter," of a place with a preposition; the latter has the notion of simple going. If we can imagine the body-guard of the king quartered in some part of the huge palace, then Daniel "went in" first to the quarters of the guard, and then, having got a mission, "went" up to Arioch, who was probably endeavouring to occupy as much time as possible to delay the horrible exe cution, or perhaps escape the necessity altogether. It would seem as if Arioch had heard nothing of the petition which Daniel had presented to the king, and only knew that his delay had not been found fault with. It might seem by the introductory word "therefore" (<span class="accented">kol-qebe-denah</span>) that the hymn has been an interpolation. It is quite true that it would most naturally immediately follow ver. 19. Yet we must bear in mind that the consecution of one part to another, which we have in our Western languages, is not so carefully observed in Eastern tongues. It may be doubted, more over, whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kol-qebel-denah</span>) has so much a logical , as a local or temporal significance. "'Thereupon" would, perhaps, more correctly render this connective here. After he had finished offering up his praise and thanks to God, Daniel went to Arioch. As we have already said, it would seem that Arioch had a reluctance to set about the fulfilment of this horrible order, not that mere slaughter was a thing specially repugnant to him - he had taken part in too many campaigns for that to impress him much; but this was a massacre of the priests. All the reverence of his nature that during his lifetime had associated itself with those who had solemnly sacrificed before each campaign, and taken the auguries, protested against this sudden and wholesale massacre. He has determined to fritter away time, in order to give his master opportunity to bethink himself The mere political ill will that would be roused by such an attempt was formidable. We know that the Babylonian monarch Nabunahid really rather fell before the intrigines of the priests and augurs than before the arms of Cyrus. To him, thus waiting and procrastinating, comes Daniel. Although there is nothing said of it in the narrative, Daniel may have given him to understand that he hoped to be able to satisfy the demands of the king. The power Daniel had of gaining the favour and confidence of those with whom he came in contacts led to his being buoyed up by a certain hope in his procrastination, which would be strengthened by the fact that the fiery young king made no inquiry whether his order was being fulfilled. Still, it must have been with joy he saw Daniel appearing, and heard him say, "Destroy not the wise men of Babylon," especially when followed by the request to be brought into the presence of the king; thus he knew that Daniel could answer the king's question and tell him his dream, as well as the promised interpretation. If we take the Septuagint rendering as representing the original text, Daniel promised to tell the king "everything." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-25.htm">Daniel 2:25</a></div><div class="verse">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation</span>. Save that the Septuagint has again <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and Paulus Tellensis adds the adjective "wise" as a description of the man who had thus professed to satisfy the king, the versions agree with the Massoretic text. In regard to the Aramaic here, the use of the Eastern form of the haphel is to be <span class="accented">noted - hanel</span> instead of <span class="accented">ha'el.</span> These are to be looked upon as archaisms or Orientalisms, that have survived modernizing efforts of the pre-Massoretic scribes. We have already remarked on this as an Eastern peculiarity which survives in the Mandaitic and in the Babylonian Talmud. The careful way in which the Septuagint renders the particular <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, omitted in the other old versions save the Peshitta, ought to be noted as a sign of the extreme carefulness of the Septuagint translator, and a reason why we should regard divergences from the Massoretic as generally evidences of a different text. It has been remarked by Archdeacon Rose that Arioch claims too much when he  asserts that he had "found Daniel." This is not exactly met by Professor Fuller's assertion that it was a mode of the court to ignore all "these captives," with something of the contempt with which the European in India regards those whom he without qualification denotes as "niggers." This, however, does not meet the case if the ordinary interpretation of the circumstances is right; then Nebuchadnezzar had not only seen Daniel in connection with this matter, but further, Arioch knew of it. The case of Abner and David before Saul, in <a href="../../par/1_samuel/17-35.htm">1 Samuel 17:35</a> should not be brought in in comparison with <a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>, as the latter does not occur in the Septuagint. Unless there has been interpolation, the explanation seems to be that Arioch was not aware that Daniel had petitioned. It may be that Arioch wishes to disarm the king's wrath by not saying anything of Daniel being one of "the wise men" against whom the king's sentence had gone out; but it may also be regarded as a proof that Daniel and his companions had not yet passed out of the class of pupils into that of wise men. He says he is "of the sons of the captivity of Judah." The haste with which Arioch brings Daniel into the king's presence may be due to his own delight at having escaped a piece of employment he had no heart for. There may have been an element of anxiety - he had procrastinated, and the young king had made no inquiries; but it was not the custom of the conqueror to give orders and not to see that they were carried out, and disobedience to the orders of Nebuchadnezzar would mean instant death, possibly with torture. Every moment was fraught with danger, so Arioch's hastening of Daniel may have been due to his own sense of relief at escape from an impending danger. But more, this haste would give the appearance of eager diligence, if not in slaughtering the wise men of Babylon, at least in searching for one who could make good to the king their lack of service toward him. His haste might be intended to give the look at once of eagerness and diligence. All the motives may have combined. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-26.htm">Daniel 2:26</a></div><div class="verse">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name <i>was</i> Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span> The variations in the versions are here unimportant, save that the Septuagint interpolates "in the Chaldee tongue" before the Babylonian name of Daniel. It is also to be noted that here, as throughout, the Babylonian name of Daniel, in beth the Greek versions, appears as <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;</span>, the same form in which they give Belshazzar. When Daniel is brought in before the king, Nebuchadnezzar demands if he can fulfil his promise, and tell the dream as well as the interpretation. There is no indication that Nebuchadnezzar remembered anything of the youth who had done well in the examination held in his presence some months before. This certainly is confirmatory of Wieseler's hypothesis. That the king should have forgotten, however, is nothing extraordinary, for the occasions of this kind would be many. Nebuchadnezzar, in the case of the young Hebrew, does not question his willingness to tell him what he wishes, but only his ability. With regard to the wise men, he believed, or professed to believe, in their ability to do what he wished, and reckoned their refusal to answer him as due to obstinacy or treason. It may be that he has moderated somewhat the rancour of his ire, and is willing to recognize their ignorance as to dreams and such light furniture of the mind as not militating against their claim to knowledge in other directions, only for his oath's sake he must demand that the dream be told him by at least some one. It may be that there was a certain emphasis on the pronoun when Nebuchadnezzar demanded of Daniel, "Is there to thee the power to declare to me the dream which I have seen, and its interpretation?" Is there to thee, mere student of the sacred mysteries as thou art, alien as thou art, a hostage from a city whose king I overthrew easily? It certainly must have been strange to Nebuchadnezzar that what the soothsayers, astrologers, and magicians of the court, the highest, and reputed to be the most skilful of their respective guilds, could not do, this young Hebrew proclaimed himself able to perform. It may be observed that while in the narrative the author calls the prophet by his sacred name Daniel, "the Divine judge," here in the presence of Nebuchadnezzar, the court name he had received is introduced. To his friends, to his fellow-countrymen, he is Daniel; but as a court official he is Belteshazzar, or perhaps Belshazzar. It may be that there is intended to be conveyed to us that not only was he introduced into the royal presence as Belshazzar, but that the king addressed him," Belteshazzar (Belshazzar), art thou able?"

The change from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d6;&#x5d4;</span> is unlikely to have been the result of any mistake in the writing of the original. It may have been the Greek scribe who misread <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> into <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta present no peculiarities worthy of notice. Jerome translates <span class="accented">asbshaphim</span> by magi, as usual, following the Peshitta. It is to be observed that here again we have a list of the different <span class="accented">classes</span> of <span class="accented">soothsayers</span>, and the class of Chaldeans is omitted, as also those marked as <span class="accented">mecashphim</span> in ver. 2; instead, occupying the same place in the catalogue, is <span class="accented">gazrin.</span> This may have been the original word, as evidently the real meaning was not known either in Egypt or Asia Minor, as both the LXX. and Theodotion transfer the word. The Peshitta translates this word by <span class="accented">asuphe</span>, in reality the corresponding one to the second word in the Chaldee. This would seem to show that the word had disappeared from Eastern as well as Western Aramaic. It is derived from <span class="accented">gezar</span>, "to eat." Behrmann ('Das Buch Daniel') derives it thus, and <span class="accented">says</span> that it refers to the fact that those who studied nativities divided the heavens into <span class="accented">sectiones</span> or <span class="accented">segmenta.</span> This was precisely what the "Chaldeans" of classic times did; hence it is quite a possible thing that Chaldeans was inserted in some Greek translations, and got into the Aramaic from the Greek. The word does not seem to be used for , astrologers" in the Talmud. The occasion of Daniel's narrating the impotence of the other wise men in presence of the task set them by the king is that probably he recognized the accent of surprise in the king's tone. As if he said, "Yes, it is perfectly true, what none of these wise men could do, I, a mere youth, undertake to do." There is nothing of contempt for them in this, as is seen in the following verse. There may be a shade of rebuke implied to the king, who had demanded from men what they could not do. They had declared that only the gods could reveal this to the king. And what Daniel says is not in opposition to this, but confirmatory of it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-28.htm">Daniel 2:28</a></div><div class="verse">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these</span>. All the versions are at one with the Massoretic text to the beginning of the last clause, which begins a new sentence. This last clause is omitted in the Septuagint. The clause is pleonastic; therefore, seeing it is omitted by the Septuagint, we may consider it not genuine, but due to a case of doublet in the Aramaic copies. Some copies have the present clause here, without the opening clause of the next, and others without this, but having the opening clause of ver. 29. Then came a copyist, who, unable to settle which was the better reading, inserted both. <span class="accented">There is a God in heaven.</span> No nation in ancient times was so addicted to the study of the stars of heaven and to the future as were the Chaldeans. Here Daniel announces that the God of heaven, Jehovah, the God of oppressed Judah and conquered Jerusalem, was the God who ruled all the stars from which the Chaldeans derived the knowledge of the future they thought they had, and arranged for his own purposes all things that were coming upon the earth, and he could tell what no one on earth could do. And the reason of this he also makes plain - God had expressly sent the dream to Nebuchadnezzar in order that he might know what was to "be in the latter days." He, Nebuchadnezzar, was the first of the great imperial powers who ruled after Israel ceased to be so much a nation as a faith. After the Babylonian Captivity Judaism became a Church over against a heathen state. Hence to him with whom this new state of things began was this message given. It has exercised many why this revelation of the future was made to this heathen monarch. Yet we must remember that, though made directly to him, through his obstinacy, it arrived at the Prophet Daniel, for whom it was meant. Yet again, no one can read the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar and fail to observe how deep and unfeigned was his piety according to his light. He worshipped Merodach, and if, in his ascriptions of praise, we were to place "Jehovah" instead of "Merodach," these prayers and thanksgivings would appear almost as if borrowed from the Hebrew Psalter. God, who readeth the hearts of men, might well have seen such a heart in this conqueror that he might be honoured with a revelation. The phrase, "latter days," had a special reference in Jewish prophetic language to the times of the Messiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>); hence we may assume that this vision would stretch in its revelations on to the times of the kingdom which the Lord would set up. It is unscientific to press this as meaning the absolute last time, as does Hitzig. It is not the future generally, as Havernick. We must be led by the usage of prophetic literature. <span class="accented">Thy dream</span>, <span class="accented">and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these.</span> This clause, as we have indicated, is probably one of two parallel readings. There is probably no distinction intended between "dream"  and "visions of the head upon the bed." This is really to be regarded as a case of parallelism, in which one portion of the verse was balanced by the other. What shade of difference there is, is between the dream as a totality and the portions of it as seen. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-29.htm">Daniel 2:29</a></div><div class="verse">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came <i>into thy mind</i> upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="accented">As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind m on thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass</span>. This verse is of somewhat suspicious authenticity, the renderings of the different versions show such a diversity of text. The Septuagint rendering is very brief, being merely a version of the last clause, "He that revealeth secrets (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) showed that which behoveth to be." This has the appearance as if the translators here rendered the last word as an infinitive, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> as not the preformatvre of the third person future, but as the sign of the infinitive. It is not necessarily so, because it may be that <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>' is regarded as included in <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lehave</span>). Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic, "O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed raised up what behoved to be after these things; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what behoveth to be." The Peshitta renders slightly differently, Thou, O king, thy thoughts arose in thy heart on account of what should be in the latter days, and he that revealeth secrets made known to thee what shall be." Even Jerome, who is usually pretty close to the Massoretic text, differs a little here. "Thou, O king, didst begin to think upon thy couch what would be after these things; and he who reveal-eth mysteries showeth thee what shall be." Paulus Tellensis has broken away from the Septuagint, supplying the clause omitted, not improbably from Theodotion, "Thou, O king, when. thou layest upon thy couch, sawest all things which behoved to happen in the last days; and he who revealeth secrets hath showed to thee what behoved to be." Altogether, with the exception of the last clause, which is evidenced by all the versions, we doubt the authenticity of this verse. However, the interpolation, if we have a case of it here, must have been of old date, as is indicated by the archaic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">an'tah</span>), which becomes in the Q'ri <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">an't</span>). Whether an interpolation or part of the original text, the picture suggested is very natural. The young conqueror, who had already secured the whole of South-Western Asia to the river of Egypt, was occupying his thoughts in speculating what should come after him. He falls asleep, and the subject of his waking thoughts becomes the subject of his dreams. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-30.htm">Daniel 2:30</a></div><div class="verse">But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for <i>any</i> wisdom that I have more than any living, but for <i>their</i> sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But as for me, this secret was not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart</span>. The Septuagint Version is simpler, "But as for me, not on account of any wisdom in me above all men is this mystery revealed, but in order that it should be shown to the king it is revealed to me what thou thoughtest in thy heart in knowledge." The translator has read the preformative <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>. There is no reference to "those who shall show the interpretation." The text before him may have omitted the plural termination; consequently, the huphal was supplied. Theodotion, the Peshitta, and Jerome all agree pretty closely with the Massoretic text, but all make the verb translated "<span class="accented">shows"</span> singular, not plural, as does the Massoretic. Of course, it may be that this was due to rendering the sense, not the words, of the original; but Theodotion especially is more prone in any difficulty to slavish adherence to his original. His rendering is, "But as for me, not for wisdom which is in me beyond all living is the mystery revealed, but that the interpretation be made known to the king in order that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart." The Pe-shitta renders the latter clauses thus: "But that the interpretation may be made known to the king, and that thou mayest know what thou didst meditate on in thy heart." Jerome, after rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">raza</span>, "secret") <span class="accented">sacra-mentum</span>, proceeds," Sed ut interpretatio regi manifesta fieret et cogitationes mentis tuae seires." The fact that the last word takes the Mandaitic form <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tin'dae</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> (<span class="accented">tidda</span>') indicates on the whole an Oriental origin. The use of the plural form, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yehod'un</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> wrongly rendered, "for their sakes who shall make known the interpretation." The Revised Version is more accurate, "but to the intent that the interpretation may be made known;" and Luther translates, "Dass dem Konige die Deutung augezeiget warde." The use of the plural for the indefinite occurs elsewhere (Wirier, &sect; 49). The position Daniel takes up is one which does not separate him from the other <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> of the court. He in effect says, "I am no wiser than the other sages who have been condemned to death, only the God of heaven can reveal what the king demands, and he has revealed it to me." The purpose of the revelation, "that thou mightest know the interpretation," is fitted to soothe his pride. The humility of Daniel has been remarked in reference to this verse. He puts himself behind the impersonal form, "in order that people may show the king  the interpretation." The reason why the interpretation was shown to Nebuchadnezzar might be really to humble him, to show him that his empire, splendid as it was, was only one in a succession, and that the whole system of world-empires would be overthrown before a kingdom set up by the God of the Jews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-31.htm">Daniel 2:31</a></div><div class="verse">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness <i>was</i> excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof <i>was</i> terrible.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof was terrible</span>. The Greek versions do not require notice, as they do not imply any difference in reading from the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is shorter, "Thou, O king, wert seeing, and, lo! a great image of beauty exceeding excellent, and it stood before thee." The opening clause of the next verse may be regarded as taking up the last clause of the verse before us. As to the Aramaic of the passage, it is to be observed that the s, me long form of the second person is used in ver. 29. The numeral <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">had</span>) is used in this verse very much in the sense of the English indefinite article which is used to translate it in the English versions. It is represented in the Greek Version by <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The particle <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">ulu</span>)," behold," does not occur in the Targums; a cognate form occurs in Samaritan, <span class="accented">hala.</span> In Talmudic it occurs in a form like the Samaritan. This word occurs in ch. 7, varied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> ('<span class="accented">aru</span>), which is regarded as a phonetic variation. It may, however, be due to defective penmanship, having the top of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> too faintly written. Its etymology is doubtful. No Assyrian root has been found from which it may be derived. The word for "image," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">tzelem</span>), occurs in the Palmyrene inscriptions, as the regular term for a memorial statue. Hence, unless reason can be shown to the contrary, we could assume, even though there had been no more, that the figure was like a statue of a man. The word for this, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>), occurs only in Daniel; the corresponding word in Ezra is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The n sound is one that so readily slips away, that its presence as a final letter is a sign that the form of a word possessing it is in an older stage than that without it; hence we would argue that as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>) is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">da</span>) of the Targums, so <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">diccen</span>) of Daniel is older than <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">dec</span>). The word that is most interesting is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">ziveh</span>); it is rendered "brightness" in our version. It is recognized by Professor Bevan, on the authority of Delitzsch, as an Assyrio-Babylonian word, therefore affording an additional evidence of the Eastern origin of Daniel. Noldeke would derive it from the Persian <span class="accented">zeb</span> (quoted by Behrmann, but there is some mistake in his reference). This tendency to derive everything from the Persian is to be suspected. The long political connection between Babylon and the Aryan nations north and east of it might easily introduce words of such an origin into the writings of a Babylonian diplomat. Another derivation is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">zahah</span>), but seems doubtful, as, although in Hebrew, there is no trace of such a verb in Aramaic. The only other word that merits note is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">reve</span>), "appearance." Professor Bevan <span class="accented">says</span> it is the only appearance in Aramaic of a corresponding root to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">ra'ah</span>), "to see." Daniel, it will be seen, lays <span class="accented">stress</span> on the emotions which each feature excited, in order to recall, not only the dream, but something of the feelings with which Nebuchadnezzar had beheld it. With this dream of Nebuchadnezzar we might compare the dream of the seer of Asshurbanipal, given by Lenormant ('La Divination,' p. 137), "The seer (<span class="accented">voyant</span>) narrated to Asshurbanipal how the goddess Istar had stood before him seated in her chariot, surrounded by flame, with a bow in her hand" (see also Smith's 'Assurbanipal,' pp. 123. 124). It is unlikely that the colossal image was identified by Nebuchadnezzar with any one of the Babylonian gods; perhaps this was one of the elements of the terror excited by the vision, that he could not identify him. If he did make any identification, Daniel does not do anything to justify him in any such identification. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-32.htm">Daniel 2:32</a></div><div class="verse">This image's head <i>was</i> of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32, 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This image's head was of fine gold, his breasts and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay</span>. The versions present no occasion of r,-mark, save that Theodotion has a doublet, <span class="accented">a</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, translating, "the hands, the breast, and the arms." The word rendered "fine" is really "good" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;</span>, <span class="accented">tab</span>). Naturally, there have not been preserved to us any composite images of this kind; gold and silver would certainly soon have found their way to the melting-pot after the fall of the Babylonian empire, had such a statue been erected in Babylon. Brass and iron were too precious not to follow in the same road. Among the Greeks, as we know, there were what were called "chryselephantine" statues, partly gold and partly ivory. In the description given of the Temple of Belus, we see a succession something akin to that in the statue, but it may be doubted whether we may deduce any connection between the two on that account. In the Book of Enoch the apocalyptist <span class="accented">sees</span> mountains of different kinds of metal - of gold, silver, brass, iron,  tin, and mercury, the first four coinciding with the metals in Daniel's vision. Ewald refers in a note to the possibility that this idea might be borrowed from Hesiod, but rightly dismisses it as improbable. As to the metals used, gold and silver were well known in ancient times, as also iron, though, from the difficulty of working it, later. What is here translated "brass" ought to be rendered "copper;" "bronze" certainly was known very early, but the whole use of the word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (Aramaic), or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span> (Hebrew), implies that it is a simple metal; thus <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/8-9.htm">Deuteronomy 8:9</a>, "Out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;</span>; Onkelos, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>). In this statue the progressive degradation of the material and situation is to be observed. The head, the highest part, gold; the shoulders, lower, silver; the belly and thighs, lower still, brass; the legs, lower yet, iron; and the feet and toes, lowest of all, a mixture of iron and clay. It is observed by Kliefoth that there is further a growing division. The head is one, without any appearance of division; the portion consisting of the breast and arms is divided, though slightly, for the chest is more important and bulky than the arms; the belly and thighs form a portion which from the plural form given to the word translated "belly," <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">m'ohi</span>), suggests more of dividedness than does that above. The lowest portion, that forming the legs and toes, has the greatest amount of division. Kliefoth also refers to another point - that while there is a progressive degradation of the metal, there is also progression in degrees of hardness, silver being harder than gold, copper harder than silver, and iron hardest of all; then suddenly the iron is mingled with clay. There is not a new, softer material added to form a new fifth part; but there is a mingling of "clay " - clay suitable for the potter, or rather that has already been baked in the kiln, and therefore in the last degree brittle. In fact, there is a progress in frangibility - gold the most ductile of metals, and iron the least so, then clay, when baked, more brittle still. There are many other successions that might be followed, which are at least ingenious. The idea suggested by the phrase, "part of iron and part of clay," is that there was not a complete mingling, but that portions were seen that were clearly clay, and other portions as clearly still iron; there was therefore the superadded notion of the imperfect union of the parts with the necessary additional weakness which follows.

The king saw this gigantic statue, not possessing the attributes of any of his national gods, and he looks on in his dream in wonder and awe. <span class="accented">Till a stone cut out without hands.</span> The Greek versions make an addition which seems necessary to the sense - "out of the mountain." This addition may certainly have been made from the later verse (ver. 45). The logical necessity, however, may have prompted this addition. On the other hand, the evidence of both the Greek versions agreeing in one addition ha. very considerable weight. It is not impossible that the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">mitturah</span>), "from the mountain," had dropped from the manuscripts used by the Massoretes. In favour of the Massoretic text is the fact that the Peshitta omits the word. On the other band, Jerome adds de monte. It may be noted, as at least a curiosity, that the Peshitta, instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">aben</span>)," a stone," gives <span class="accented">kepha</span>, from which Cephas, the name of the Apostle Peter, is derived. As the monarch gazes at the huge image, he <span class="accented">sees</span> behind the image a mountain towering above the image, huge as it is. From this mountain he sees a boulder detach itself, as if it were being cut with chisel and wedge, but no hands are risible. Once set loose from the mountain's side, it came by bounds and leaps down the declivity, "<span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">smote the image</span> upon <span class="accented">his feet that were of iron and clay."</span> Every bound that the stone makes down the mountain is larger, and raises it higher and makes it strike the earth with more of force, till with a bound greater than any it had made before, it strikes the feet of the image, "which were of iron <span class="accented">and</span> clay" mingled, yet separate - and at once they are broken in pieces: "utterly crushed" is the meaning of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">duq</span>). The Septuagint tendering is <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "ground;" it occurs in <a href="../../par/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>, of Moses grinding the golden calf to powder. Theodotion's word is not a correct rendering of the word; it is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, "beat into thin scales;" comp. <a href="../../par/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>:(42) 45 ("the stone which the builders rejected"), "on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder." It is to be observed that this cutting of the stone out of the mountain took place after the fourth portion of the image was clearly visible. In the dream the catastrophe took place after the stone had been cut from the mountain and had bounded down its side.  A similar chronological succession may be expected in the events foreshadowed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-35.htm">Daniel 2:35</a></div><div class="verse">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors</span>. The versions arc closer to the Massoretic than our Authorized Version, as they all give more prominence to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kahadah</span>), "at once." It is rendered "together." The LXX. renders <span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;</span> the Peshitta repeats the word; and Jerome renders <span class="accented">pariter.</span> Theedotion changes the order somewhat, for the sake of making it more symmetrical. The rendering of the LXX. is in some respects different from the natural sense of the Massoretic text, but not so much so as to require us to presume a radically different text: "Then the iron, and the clay, etc., became fragments, and they were smaller than the chaff of the threshing-floor." We have this verse also in the Itala, preserved to us in Tertullian, but it does not differ from Jerome seriously. It would follow naturally enough if the mighty image were so smitten on its weak and fragile feet, that it would come crashing to the earth; but more happened than this. As the monarch looked, in falling, the various parts of the image, as they fell in a heap, became broken, nay, triturated - they became as the dust or chaff of the summer threshing-floor. Summer is the dead time in the East; harvest is over by the end of June, and the threshing of corn then commences. All this huge statue was reduced to particles as small and light as the chaff that is beaten off the grain by the threshing instruments of those days - feet of oxen or wheel of cart. Chaff is a favourite symbol for lightness and worthlessness. In the first psalm the wicked are compared to chaff; so in <a href="../../par/psalms/28.htm">Psalm 28</a>. In Hosea, where he speaks (<a href="../../par/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>) of Israel's <span class="accented">sins</span>, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "Ephraim shall be like the chaff of the threshing-floor." Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15, 16</a>) speaks of Jacob getting new threshing instruments to thresh the mountains, and make them small as chaff. It may be noted that the word here translated "chaff" only occurs here. The word does not appear in the Targums, instead of which is used <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">motz</span>), the Hebrew word. In Syriac, again, in the Peshitta, it occurs frequently, as <a href="../../par/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/40-15.htm">Isaiah 40:15</a> - another sign, slight in itself, of the Eastern origin of the Book of Daniel. The fact that the word occurred in Daniel would have a tendency to preserve it if in use when Daniel was published, or introduce it if it were not. Yet, as we have said, it does not appear in the Targums. It does appear in Syriac, the language of a people who, as not Jews, would presumably not be familiar with Daniel. The word for "threshing-floor," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">iddrei</span>), is also one that does not appear in the Targums, but it does appear in the Peshitta. Jensen suggests an Assyrian etymology, but Brockelmann marks this doubtful; Lagarde suggests a Persian etymology, also marked doubtful. Whichever etymology holds bears out the Eastern origin of the book. The Targums represent the older Aramaic of Palestine. If Daniel were a book originating in Palestine, the Persian words appearing in it might also be expected to appear in the Targums. <span class="cmt_word">And the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth</span>. The LXX. rendering is, "And the wind carried them away, so that there was nothing left of them, and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and smote the whole earth." The first portion of this is a fairly correct rendering of our present Massoretic text. On the other hand, the latter clause implies that the translator had before him, or imagined he had, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>; not impossibly <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> might be written without the silent a; thus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5ea;</span>, as in the Peshitta. In that case the mistake might easily be made. Behrmann remarks on the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span> in this passage being the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;</span>, but does not remark that it is written defectively in Syriac. The sense in the Massoretic text is much better than that implied in this reading. Theodotion's rendering differs in the first clause of this portion of the present verse, "And the abundance (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of wind carried it away, and place was not found for them: and the stone, when it had smitten (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) the image, became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." The rendering "multitude" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) is due to reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. This form of the plural of the demonstrative pronoun is the commoner in Biblical Aramaic, but does not appear in the Targums nor the Peshitta. It is akin to the Mandaitic <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. Neither the Peshitta nor the Vulgate presents any peculiarities of rendering. All this mass that had formed the image, though it had been gold, silver, brass, and iron, yet was so ground down - had become reduced to particles so small, that the wind carried them away. So scattered were they that they collected in no special place, so that one could say, "This is the image." The figure is still that of the threshing-floor; the wind, blowing on the grain that is lifted up before it, carries away the chaff, but, search as one may, the chaff, once blown away, cannot be found. A more remarkable thing now takes place - the  stone that, bounding down the mountainside, had smitten the image on the feet, so that it fell and became as dust, now grows apace, overtopping the utmost height the image had attained, overtopping the mountain from which it had been cut. Not only did it grow in height, but, as it increased in height, its base broadened till the whole earth was filled with it. There seems to be a reference here to <a href="../../par/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>, "<span class="accented">The</span> mountain of the Lord's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it." As the monarch gazes in his dream, the change is completed, the huge image, with its glittering head and gleaming breast, its polished thighs and legs of iron, its unseemly feet that inspired terror by its very appearance, had utterly disappeared, and its place was occupied by a mountain, huge but peaceful, on which the flocks might browse and trees might grow. It may be noted, though not as of importance, that the material of the mountain is most akin with that of the weak clay of which the feet of the image were largely composed. Such, then, is the dream which Nebuchadnezzar had seen, and which the prophet now presented once more before him. We must, however, glance at the picture presented by the reading of the LXX. To the translator the picture evidently present was that of a stone descending from the mountain, and increasing in momentum as it descends; but this stone further increases in size, till before its tremendous strokes and rebounds the very solid earth quakes.

It is scarcely a variation when the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, "to," instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "before," that is to say, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">qedam</span>).

Having finished telling Nebuchadnezzar his dream, Daniel now announces his intention of giving the interpretation. Commentators have noticed the fact that Daniel does not say, "I will give," but "we." The opinion of Professor Fuller is that Daniel here includes with himself his three companions; of Keil, Kranichfeld, Zockler, and Behrmann, that he identifies himself with all worshippers of Jehovah; Aben Ezra makes the plurality by making him refer to himself and the Divine wisdom; Jephet-ibn-Ali makes its force lie in contrast; Hitzig makes it really the <span class="accented">pluralis excellintiae</span>, and quotes in defence <a href="../../par/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a> and Genesis 11:7, where it is God himself that speaks. Had Daniel introduced the phrase, "thus saith the Lord," this opinion might have been defended. It may be that Daniel fell back on the methods and ordinary mode of address for an astrologer before the King of Babylon (see ver 7). He does not wait for the king to acknowledge that this is the dream he had. Daniel at once pro-coeds with the interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-37.htm">Daniel 2:37</a></div><div class="verse">Thou, O king, <i>art</i> a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</span> The Septuagint renders the latter clause, "To thee the Lord of heaven gave the dominion, and the kingdom, and the might, and the honor, and the glory in all the earth (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>)." There appears here to be two cases of doublet; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> are probably originally alternative renderings of <span class="accented">malcutha</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;</span> double renderings of <span class="accented">yiqara.</span> On this hypothesis there is only one Greek word for two Aramaic. We shall consider this later. Paulus Tellensis, in his translation of the Septuagint Version, draws the beginning of the next verse into connection with the final words of this verse as given here. The words, "in the whole earth," is a transference from the next verse. The rendering of Theodotion is, "Thou, O king, art a king of kings, to whom the God of heaven gave a strong and mighty and honourable kingdom," making thus <span class="accented">hisna</span>, <span class="accented">toqpa</span>, and <span class="accented">yiqara</span> adjectives of <span class="accented">malcut a.</span> But <span class="accented">malcutha</span> is feminine, and, if adjectives. <span class="accented">hisna</span>, etc., are masculine. The Peshitta differs from the Massoretic in leaving out one of the terms, "Thou, O king, art a king of kings; God most high (<span class="accented">merima</span>) a strong kingdom and glory has given to thee." Of course, the same objection holds to some extent against this version as against that of Theodotion, but it is to be noted that there are not two words conveying the same idea of strength. As there was only one in the Septuagint, we are inclined to think that <span class="accented">toqpi</span> must have been an addition. Jerome's rendering is, "Thou art a king of kings, and the God of heaven has given to thee the kingdom, and might, and dominion, and glory." There seems to be a transposition here. The general scope of this verse and the next is given in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/27-5.htm">Jeremiah 27:5, 6</a>. There is certainly high honour given to Nebuchadnezzar in this address, but, at the same time, he is warned that all his glory is bestowed upon him by the God of heaven. It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar interpreted the words as referring to Merodach, the god whom he specially worshipped, or regarded the God of heaven as only another of the gods many and lords many which, as a polytheist, he acknowledged. The title of the Babylonian king was <span class="accented">shar-sharani</span>," king of kings," and  <span class="accented">sharru-rabbu</span>, "great king." Thus in this address the technical title is given him. The Babylonian monarchs assumed this from their Assyrian predecessors, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Asshurbanipal (Smith, 'History,' pp. 26, 73, 196). From the Babylonians it was passed on to the Persian monarchs. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/26-7.htm">Ezekiel 26:7</a> the prophet gives Nebuchadnezzar this title. As we find by the succeeding verse, the kingdom here is not mere royalty or kingship, but the special royalty of practically universal empire; that is to say, universal so far as the knowledge of the times went. Our rendering in the Authorized Version fails in accuracy, in not inserting the definite article, which is really implied in the sign of the <span class="accented">status emphaticus.</span> Luther makes the same mistake. Happily the Revisers have altered matters, and inserted "the," as does Behrmann. The Greek Version and Peshitta are accurate in this. The word translated "power," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">his'na</span>), <span class="accented">is</span> consonantly present in both dialects of more recent Aramaic. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-38.htm">Daniel 2:38</a></div><div class="verse">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou <i>art</i> this head of gold.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and bath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold</span>. The Septuagint, if we take along with this verse the final clause of the preceding verse, has even more of that look of exaggeration which we can scarcely fail to be conscious of in the Massoretic, "In all the earth inhabited by men, and wild beasts, and birds of the heaven, and fish of the sea, be delivered (all things) into thy hand to rule over all" The addition to the realm of Nebuchadnezzar of the dwelling-place of the fish of the sea is readily observed. Theodotion has the same addition, "In every place where the sons of men dwell, he gave into thy hand beasts of the earth, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and appointed thee lord of all." One cannot but observe not only the presence of "the fishes," but also the fact that only the lower animals are given into his power. It may be that here, as in the LXX., the object is to render with slavish exactness the original - unobservant of the fact that the construction was irregular. Behrmann thinks the author had before his mind <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d8;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">hashaltak</span>), "has made thee ruler," and then changed the construction. Something might be said for <span class="accented">Moses</span> Stuart's view that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> should be translated" wherever," it' there were any similar construction to be found. The rendering of the Peshitta agrees with the sense of Moses Stuart, "Every place where the <span class="accented">sons</span> of men dwell, the bird of heaven, or the beast of the field, he hath given into thy band, and caused thee to rule over all of them." The change of order is to be noted. The Vulgate agrees with the Massoretic. The word for "dwelling" is an older form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dareen</span>), instead of the more recent form, which is that read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">dayreen</span>). This copious insertion of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> is an Eastern peculiarity. This assertion of Daniel must seem exaggerated to us, but we must remember the courtly form of address that was usual in Oriental courts, and that Nebuchadnezzar in all likelihood claimed this breadth of empire; so Daniel, in order to make way for the assertion he had already made of the king's dependence on One higher, gives him everything he claims. The addition of the sea to his dominion, although in it Theodotion supports the LXX., is due to a mistaken idea of the point of Daniel's statements. He adds, <span class="accented">Thou art this head of gold.</span> This is not, as Hitzig <span class="accented">asserts</span>, Nebuchadnezzar personally, but to him as the type of the Babylonianmonarch. This was but natural, as of the duration of this monarchy his independent reign extended to the half. Before his advent as "king's son," the Babylonian Empire had to endure the assault of Egypt, and had to struggle for existence against it. With his ado, at began its glory, with his disappearance began at once its decadence. Only under Nebuchadnezzar was Babylon really imperial. The short reigns of his successors are proofs of an insufficient hand upon the reins. With all the tyrannical moods to which be was subject, and all the wild whirlwinds of passion which were liable to carry him away, Nebuchadnezzar, as presented to us here, was a splendid man  - utterly unlike Epiphanes, we may remark in passing, with his low tastes and his cringing submission to Rome. His brilliance was that of Alcibiades; he had nothing of the dignity implied in the head of gold. Nebuchadnezzar had secured the love of this captive, as we see by the sorrow with which Daniel communicated to him his approaching madness. There is thus a reasonableness in making him, in especial, the head of gold. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-39.htm">Daniel 2:39</a></div><div class="verse">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> None of the versions presents any difficulties, or gives occasion for any  remark, save the Vulgate, which inserts <span class="accented">argenteum</span>, as if reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5e1;&#x5e4;</span>. The word used, "kingdom," not "king," shows, without possibility of reasonable dispute, that in identifying Nebuchadnezzar with the head of gold, the reference is not to him per-serially, but to him as representing his dynasty. The next dynasty is said to be inferior, that is to <span class="accented">say</span>, nearer the ground <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">ar'a</span>), which is certainly true of the shoulders in relation to the head. Not only does the inferior metal imply inferiority, but the inferior position dues so also. The metal is omitted here, but stated in the next clause, <span class="accented">Another third kingdom of brass</span>, <span class="accented">which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> The metal is here referred to, but not the position; there is no need to say it is inferior - that is implied when it is said to be a kingdom of brass. We need only refer to what we have said above, as to the fact that "brass" here really means "copper." As the inferiority stated in the first clause is omitted in the second, so the statement made at the end, which grammatically applies only to the third kingdom, applies also to the second. It is only as, in a sense, bearing rule over the whole earth, that any monarchy comes into this statue at all. When we look at these two, we find certainly the two arms suggesting and rendering emphatic a twofoldness of some sort in this power. The fact that, in the description of the statue, the word translated "belly" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;</span>) is plural, suggests, along with the <span class="accented">two</span> thighs, the idea of four-foldness. Faintly is this suggestion made, but the exigencies of the figure must be considered. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-40.htm">Daniel 2:40</a></div><div class="verse">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all <i>things</i>: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise</span>. The version of the LXX. differs considerably here, "The fourth kingdom <span class="accented">shall be</span> strong as iron, as iron which subdueth all things, even as iron cutteth down every tree." It is evident that the translator has read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">illan</span>), "a tree," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">illeen</span>), "these." The last clause is due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;</span> (<span class="accented">vetayroa</span>') being written with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span>; however, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>) is not unlike, in ancient Aramaic script, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">kaph</span>), although <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">lamed</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> not like <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tau</span>), yet the phrase <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> would carry the reader over every obstacle. Theodotion differs less from the Massoretic," The fourth kingdom is that which shall be as strong as iron, just as (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) iron beateth small and subdueth all things, thus shall it beat small and subdue all things." It may be observed that the clause, "and as iron breaketh all these," is omitted from the text. It certainly appears to be an addition, indeed, has the look of a "doublet." This view is confirmed by the fact that the Peshitta also omits this clause. The Peshitta rendering is," The fourth kingdom shall be strong like iron, and even as iron crushes and bruises all, thus even it shall beat small and subdue all." The Vulgate rendering also omits a clause, "And the fourth kingdom shall be like iron, as iron beats small and subdues all things, it shall beat small (<span class="accented">comminuet</span>) all these." For these grounds we feel inclined to regard the clause in question as an explanatory note, which has slipped into the text. Before we leave the consideration of the text, we must observe that the word for "fourth" assumes the Syriac, or Eastern Aramaic form, not the form in Chaldee, or Western Aramaic. That empire which was represented by the basest of the four metals, and occupied the lowest position in the figure, is that which is the most powerful. When we go back we find brass is the next in point of hardness and strength; it is the third, and of it, at all events, if not also of that which preceded it, it is said that "it shall bear rule over all the earth." The inferiority indicated by the metals and by the position occupied in the image, did not indicate inferiority in power or in extent of dominion. An interesting theory has been formed by Dr. Bonnar ('Great Interregnum'), that this degeneration was one of type. The monarchy as exhibited in Babylon, especially when the monarch was a man of genius, as was Nebuchadnezzar, was likest to the rule of the Almighty over the world: his authority was without limit, direct and absolute over every one subject to his sceptre The Medo-Persian monarchy had much of the Babylonian absoluteness, but there were, if Herodotus is to be trusted, the peers of the crown, and, above all, there were the satraps, with their almost independent position in respect to the central power. The third, in our author's opinion, the Hellenic, had the monarchy limited, not only by numerous compeers, as the king in Antioch was balanced by the kings in Alexandria and Pergamus, not to speak of the monarchs of Parthia, but also by the autonomous cities with the semblance of freedom. The fourth, the Roman, was yet further removed from the old Divine-right monarchy of the Babylonian type. At their first intercourse with the Jews the Romans were Republicans. Their first conquest of Judaea was made by Pompey, the general of the Republic. To the last the emperor, whatever his power, was still theoretically the first magistrate of a republic. The feet and toes of mingled clay and iron, he held, were modern constitutional monarchies - monarchies built upon  democracy and the will of the people. All this is doomed to be overthrown by the coming of the <span class="accented">Messianic</span> kingdom.

And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</span> The version of the Septuagint is worthy of notice here, "And as thou sawest (hast seen, <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) its feet and toes were partly of potter's clay, and partly of iron. Another kingdom shall be divided in itself, as thou sawest the iron mingled with the miry clay, and the toes of the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part shall be broken. And as thou sawest the iron mingled with the miry clay, there shall be mixings (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) to the generation (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) of mankind (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), but they shall not agree nor be well affected one to another, just as (<span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;</span>) iron cannot be compounded with clay." It may be observed here that a clause is omitted from ver. 41, "but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron." In the forty-third verse the difference is due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> as infinitive of the verb "to sow," that is to say, the translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>. The addition of <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> has had its origin in a false idea that the feet and toes of the image represented a new world-dominion. Theodotion renders, "Because (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) thou sawest the feet and the toes part of potter's clay, and part of iron, a kingdom shall be divided, and there will be in it from the iron root in like manner as thou sawest the iron mingled with the potter's clay. And the toes of the feet were partly iron, and partly clay, part of the kingdom shall be strong, and part of it shall be broken (being broken, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); because thou sawest the iron mingled with the potter's clay, there shall be mixings with the seed of men: but they shall not adhere one to another, even as iron is not mingled with clay." Neither in Syriac nor Chaldee has <span class="accented">netzab</span> the meaning "to be firm;" <span class="accented">nitzebthah</span> means, in later Aramaic, "a seedling." Originally, however, it meant "to confirm," "to set up," "to strengthen," as the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">yatzab</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">natzab</span>). This meaning had been lost sight of by the time Theodotion wrote, or possibly before the translation was made which he revised. The Peshitta does not call for remark, save that it agrees with Theodotion in translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">nitzeba-thah</span>) "root." Jerome renders it <span class="accented">plantarium.</span> This new development of the image is to be regarded, not as another empire, but as the outgrowth of the fourth kingdom. This is clear from the fact that there is no new substance introduced of which the feet and toes are wholly made up, but the iron is mingled with a new and inferior substance, potter's clay. The numerical mark "ten," which is to be regarded as the peculiar distinctive sign of the fourth empire, is in the toes. This last empire, whatever it may be taken to be, is one that splits itself up into approximately ten parts or sub-kingdoms. Further, there shall be a foreign element introduced which shall not harmonize with the original material. Professor Bevan is certain that the reference is "to the marriages of the Ptolemies with the Se-leucidae." Notwithstanding that Professor Bevan states this view as if it could not be doubted, it is evidently false. Both the Lagids and the Seleucids were Macedonians, and there was no natural incompatibility. If marriage is intended here, and if the fourth monarchy were the Hellenic, more sensible would have been the suggestion that it referred to the Hellenizing of South-Western Asia - the miscegenation of the peoples inaugurated by Alexander the Great, only it did not proceed very far. Further, it did not signalize the end of the Greek rule, but really the beginning of it. We admit certainly that the LXX. translates in a way that suggests the marriage of a superior with an inferior race. But there is no reference in reality to marriage, but to the mingling of two distinct culture-elements, the infusion of barbarous races into the midst of a civilized; and the barbarians taking on some of the outward forms of civilization would represent better the thing indicated. But to take this as referring to the marriage of the Seleucids and Lagids is certainly as wrong as wrong can be, although it is held by Moses Stuart, Hitzig, Ewald, as well as Professor Bevan. Not one of them shows which, the Seleucid or the Lagid, is "the clay," "the seed of men," and which the governing power or race that mingles with them. Yet the inferiority of the clay is an essential element in the symbolism. Hoffmann's idea, that there is reference to the marriage of the Emperor Otto II. and the Russian grandduke Wladimir with the daughters of the Byzantine emperor, is equally far-fetched. Certainly the intrusion into the Roman Empire of the Germanic tribes on the. one side, and of the Arabs and Turks on the other, is an interpretation much  closer to the real meaning of the symbol. A good deal can be said for Dr. Bonnar's theory, that it is the effort of monarchy to rest on democracy. As to the number, <span class="accented">ten</span>, it is not to be made absolute; it may be more than ten or fewer than ten. All that is necessary is that the number be considerably more than four, and not so numerous as to suggest an indefinite multitude. The fact of "the toes" occupying the same portion of the image, seems to signify that these ten divisions were simultaneously existing. What is symbolized is clearly a state of matters not unlike what was in Greece after the defeat of the Persians, and before the Macedonian domination - a number of separate states forming part of one system. Such, to a certain extent, was the empire of the Diadochi, or successors of Alexander, only they were not generally more than four, five, or six - mainly four, the Seleucids, the Lagids, the Attalids, and the Anti-gonids. Such was the state of matters under the Holy Roman Empire, when what are now the six great powers were gradually separating themselves off. A similar state of matters existed at the same time among the Mohammedan powers, which acknowledged a certain suzerainty in the Caliph of Bagdad, but warred with each other with great freedom. While we have said that there is an appearance of simultaneity given to these monarchs or dynasties, candour compels us to acknowledge that they may be successive. We would not desire to anticipate what we say below in a special excursus on the four monarchies of Daniel; yet we may be permitted to indicate two senses in which the number <span class="accented">ten</span> may indicate Rome. There were <span class="accented">ten</span> emperors to the capture of Jerusalem, and the end of Judaism as a civil power, and the consequent independence of the Church from the trammels of Judaism. Further, a fair case might be made out for the different magistrates that exercised authority, more or less supreme, in Rome - consuls, praetors, dictators, magistri equitum, censors, tribunes. All these were replaced by the emperors. We merely indicate this, as we shall consider the subject more at large below.

These are arranged in the reverse order in which they are first mentioned, that is to say, we have first the clay, then the iron, and so on, to the gold. This is the order followed by Jerome. On the other hand, the Peshitta follows the Massoretic order. The reason for the order adopted in the Septuagint. Theodotion, and the Vulgate is evidently a symmetrical one, and therefore more likely to be the result of emendation than the somewhat haphazard order of the received text. It is, however, not impossible that the similarity of sound has led to <span class="accented">haspa</span>, "clay," being brought out of its proper place at the beginning of the list and placed in juxtaposition with <span class="accented">kaspa</span>, "silver." Ewald thinks that the order of the Greek versions is to be preferred. Professor Bevan is doubtful, and refers to the order of the metals in <a href="../../par/daniel/5-4.htm">Daniel 5:4</a>, which begins with "gold" and ends with "stone." <span class="accented">In the days of these kings.</span> This must refer to the kings who made up the last dynasty, especially the kings of the sub-dynasties represented by the ten toes. If the traditional interpretation is correct, these days are still future. It is not impossible that all the dynasties of the vision are implied, and that the kingdom of heaven is preparing during the whole period; only the natural meaning is that we have assumed. <span class="accented">Shall the</span> God <span class="accented">of heaven set up a kingdom.</span> It may be noted that, while in the rest of this chapter the Septuagint renders this title, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, here the rendering is, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. This is a clear statement of the Messianic hopes of the Jews on one side - a Messianic kingdom and Messianic times. This new kingdom is on a different plane from those that preceded it, which go to make up the mysterious image. It is explained to be from the direct interference of the God of heaven that this new kingdom is intruded upon history. When we look at the material, it is inferior to all that had gone before - inferior even to the fire-baked clay of the potter, which formed the toes of the image. This way of representing the Messianic kingdom would have appeared inadequate to an ordinary Jew. Waiving the fact that he regarded the Messianic empire to be another such as the empires of Assyria and Babylonia, only greater, the Jew would certainly have declared that the Messianic kingdom of heaven was a precious stone, not an ordinary piece of rock that goes to build up the framework of the mountains. It is impossible to deny that it is strange that the symbol should be thus a less precious material than even that  of the lowest and weakest kingdom of the worldly system of dynasties. When we look at a metal, how homogeneous it is! With rocks, again, begins individualism. The more precious metals, with their extreme ductility, seem to be further removed from this individualism than the baser, such as copper and iron, and clay is still less removed than iron. But simple rock is furthest removed of all from metallic homogeneousness: the grains that compose it, unlike the chemical atoms of the metal, are visible to the naked eye. The process of degradation, which had proceeded through kingdom after kingdom, had now reached its lowest point. Wherever the setting up of this Messianic kingdom is placed, whenever it is held as occurring, it is certain it fits most naturally the Christian Church. The old civilization, represented by the Assyrian monarchy, had only one free man in the state, and that was the king. The Persians had nobles whose power rendered the king's supremacy less absolute than it had been in the Assyrian days. In the days of Greek and Roman supremacy the freedom of citizenship was, even in the republics, possessed only by a few, the rest were slaves. Still, the freedom was much more widely spread than in the Persian and Assyrian monarchies; only the Church, the kingdom of heaven, made of slaves citizens. It is the very acme of individualism. Looked at from without, the kingdom of heaven was a thing to be despised - a thing for freedmen and slaves, for poor workmen and peasants. In the Assyrian form of government the king was the state; <span class="accented">so</span> the royal metal, gold, is used. In the Persian the nobles rule; so we have silver. In Greece it is the free citizens, therefore the artistic but less noble metal, copper, or, perhaps, its composite form as bronze, is used. In Rome, in imperial times, it is the soldiery, and therefore iron is the metal that symbolizes them. Shall we step over the intervening centuries of retrogression, and see in the clay the modern mercantile and manufacturing interests? To the ordinary eye of the world, there is a progressive degeneracy here. The lowest point is reached; not even the rich, not to speak of the noble and learned, but the poor and the ignorant, form the kingdom. Another contrast in the symbol is that these metallic empires remained stationary; they reached a limit, then could go no further - not growth, but stationariness, is represented by their symbol; but this stone cut out of the mountain "grows," and ceases not till it has filled the earth. Further, the kingdoms which went to build up the dream-statue endure only for a time; this rock-built kingdom is an ever-lasting kingdom. It is not limited either in extent or duration. This, again, suits only the Church of Christ; fitted and intended to fill the earth, it also has an unending duration. The world itself may end, but the Church does not. We do not mean to assert that Daniel foresaw this distinctly; the very idea of the prophetic office implied that the speaker often did not know the full import of his own words. <span class="accented">It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms</span>, <span class="accented">and it shall stand for ever.</span> The silent, disruptive influence of Christianity is exhibited in regard to slavery, which was the foundation of the ancient state. Without opposing slavery, to appearance, it laid down principles which rendered slavery impossible. The supreme dignity it gives to the individual, as bearing the image of God, affirms the claims of democracy, and so affirms them that the modern state must disappear. <span class="accented">Forasmuch as thou sawest the stone teas cut out of the mountain without hands.</span> Nothing could be more silent or unobserved by the men of the world, or more unlikely to form the beginning of a new world-power than Christianity. If Judaism was regarded as "the mountain of the Lord's house," then this new kingdom was cut from it, as Christianity was from Judaism. <span class="accented">And that it brake</span>, etc. The reason why Nebuchadnezzar had seen all this - the growth of this kingdom, the way it destroyed all other kingdoms - was now to be made known. <span class="accented">The great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter</span>; or, as it ought to be rendered, <span class="accented">a great god.</span> The word, as observed by Professor Bevan, is not in the <span class="accented">status emphaticus</span>; see <a href="../../par/ezra/5-8.htm">Ezra 5:8</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">elaha rabba</span>). Daniel thus recognizes the fact that, to his heathen master, all that in the first instance he can convey to him <span class="accented">-</span> the only idea he can give him - of the greatness of Jehovah is that he is very great, not that he is the solely Great One in the universe (see Behrmann). Zockler, Ewald, Keil, and Kranichfeld assert that the fact of the words "great god" (<span class="accented">elah tab</span>) being in the absolute, not the emphatic state, is due to the elevation of pectic language. In the first place, this is not poetry, and, in the second place, neither of these writers gives any example of such a change of construction taking place. <span class="accented">Made known to the king.</span> Why was it to "the king"? One objectsecured by making this revelation known to Nebuchadnezzar himself was that it secured its publicity. Had the vision been made known to Daniel himself, he could not have announced that the empire of Babylon should pass away, without running the risk of being condemned for treason. The king's action had made  both dream and interpretation perforce public in a way they could not otherwise have been. <span class="accented">What shall come to pass hereafter</span>; literally, <span class="accented">which shall be after these things.</span> This does not mean in the immediate future, but after the state of matters at present existing - the domination of the world by great powers after the system of great world-empires has passed away, then will the Lord's kingdom be set up. <span class="accented">And the dream is certain</span>, <span class="accented">and the interpretation thereof sure</span>; or, literally, to bring out the emphasis, <span class="accented">certain</span> - established -  <span class="accented">it i</span>s <span class="accented">the dream</span>, <span class="accented">and sure -</span> faithful <span class="accented">- the interpretation.</span> This is not a mere assertion of the fact that he, Daniel, had given an exact account of what the king had seen in his dream, and a correct interpretation of its import; of the first the king was the best judge. It is rather an argument: "The account of the dream is correct; from this learn that the interpretation is sure."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 46.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span> The Greek versions render in such a way that we are almost obliged to recognize an act of idolatrous worship. Jerome, too, distinctly says," Nebuchodonoser... Danielem ador-avit et hostias et incensnm praecepit ut sacri-ficarent." The same idea is conveyed by the Peshitta, but less definitely, from the fact that <span class="accented">qorban</span> means a "gift" as well as an "oblation;" though the gift is usually a consecrated gift. In the Aramaic of the Bible we have certain phrases used for "sacrifice;" several of these are here employed: it is true all of them have the possibility of being used in a somewhat lower meaning. The mere "falling down before Daniel upon his face," when the person who did it was Nebuchadnezzar, is extraordinary, and can only be explained by the idea of worship. When we find the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">segad</span>) used immediately after, it is very difficult to refuse to believe that the Greek Version and Jerome are right when they translate the latter word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>. The word occurs repeatedly in the following chapter, invariably as "worship." The corresponding Hebrew word occurs in the second chapter of Isaiah, in the sense of "idolatrous worship" (<a href="../../par/isaiah/2-20.htm">Isaiah 2:20</a>). It certainly does mean "to bend." Had the word thus stood alone, we could not have been certain that it meant "worship;" but when it follows the extreme act of prostration to the earth, "worship' must be meant. The separate terms, <span class="accented">minhah</span>, <span class="accented">nihohin</span>, <span class="accented">lenassakah lah</span>, might, taken separately, mean "gifts" and the "bestowment of gifts;" but, taken together, it is impossible not to regard the action as one of sacrificial offering. It is true <span class="accented">minhah</span> means "a present," as when Jacob sends a present to Esau (<a href="../../par/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13</a>); but, in that connection, <span class="accented">nasak is</span> not used. It is quite true that the burning of sweet odours was a common enough thing in entertaining guests whom it was desired to honour, but the term <span class="accented">neehoheen</span> was not given to the aromatic woods so used. People sometimes, even at present, scent their rooms by burning aromatic woods, but they never in such <span class="accented">cases</span> call them <span class="accented">incense.</span> But from the fact that the old Greek version and Jerome read <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">hostias</span>, the doubt seems forced upon us that the reading here has been altered, and that the true reading was <span class="accented">deebheen -</span> not <span class="accented">neehoheen - this</span> is a change that could with difficulty be imagined as occurring accidentally, but readily enough might happen from the desire to defend Daniel from the charge of allowing idolatrous worship to be offered to him. The instance referred to as parallel - the homage which Josephus relates Alexander the Great gave to Jaddua - is not quite on all fours with the present case. We are, in the first place, expressly told that it was "<span class="accented">the</span> name" of Jehovah, engraved on the <span class="accented">petalon</span> on the front of the priest's mitre, that Alexander worshipped (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). In the next place, we have no notice of sacrifice or incense being ordered to be offered to the high priest. It is not correct to say that <span class="accented">nasak</span> of necessity means "pour out an oblation," to the exclusion of the more general meaning of "<span class="accented">offer sacrifice."</span> The corresponding word in Arabic means "to sacrifice" (Behrmann). Behrmann says, in regard to this, truly, "As to Porphyry later, so to the author and to the first readers of this book, it would have seemed indecent if Daniel had allowed himself to be honoured as a god." This would have been true had the author been a contemporary of the Maccabees. The tide of feeling that led Peter to refuse the prostration of Cornelius, and Paul and Barnabas the sacrifices at Lystra, would have prevented any one inventing such a scene. It is perfectly true the worship was probably directed to the Divine Spirit as resident in Daniel, rather than to Daniel himself; few except the lowest and most degraded of heathen worshipped idols in any other way - the divine spirit, the deity, was the real object of worship, whose sign they were, and who resided in them. We must bear in mind that Daniel had been brought up in an idolatrous court, perhaps, also, he had to submit, on pain of suffering the fate that befell Paul and Barnabas when they refused the worship of the people of Lystra. We must lay stress on the very different relationship to idolatry and its worship implied in Daniel  thus suffering sacrifice and incense to be offered to him, from that subsisting in the time of the Maccabees. No writer of that period would have written a sacred romance in which he represented a servant of God receiving idolatrous honours. The attitude of later Judaism is exemplified by Jephet-ibn-Ali, who says that though "Nebuchadnezzar commanded that sacrifices be brought to him as to a god, he (Daniel) does not say that he brought them to him. Most probably Daniel prohibited him from doing so." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a></div><div class="verse">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth <i>it is</i>, that your God <i>is</i> a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a Revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret</span>. The versions do not exhibit any important variation from the Massoretic text. We must observe the plural form of the pronoun "your," implying the Hebrew nation as a whole, or at all events the three youths along with Daniel. It must be noted that the titles are not in the emphatic state, but are simply absolute, implying that Nebuchadnezzar simply placed the God of heaven, the God of Daniel, in his pantheon, as one of the superior gods. The historical difficulty that some have seen in Nebuchadnezzar making this confession to God, and yet straightway framing a golden image, is due to a failure to understand the attitude of a polytheist to his gods. To the heathen his god is a person he is afraid of, much more powerful than he is himself, able to do him much ill, or, on the other hand, able to bestow upon him much good, but able to be deceived, cajoled, and flattered. In worshipping his deities the heathen feels that any breach of sacred etiquette in regard to any deity is far more certain of bringing down the vengeance of the aggrieved power than any crime, however heinous. He would be most potent in prayer who could go over all the deities of the pantheon, and give to each his or her appropriate title. Thus the Hindus tell tales of fakirs whose power over the gods was due to this. One of the forms of this religious etiquette was to address each deity as if he were the supreme god who alone deserved worship. Lenormant ('Los Premieres Civilizations,' 2:159) gives an address to the god Hourki, or Sin, in which he is called "prince of the gods of heaven and earth, the good god, the great god, lather of gods and men, the lord who extends his power over heaven and earth" In the same work (p. 178) there is an address to <span class="accented">Marduk</span> (Merodach), the favourite deity of Nebuchadnezzar, in which he is called "god of gods, king of heaven and earth." A little further on in the same work (p. 18t) Nebu is called "the supreme intelligence, scribe of the universe, who bears the supreme sceptre, the interpreter of the celestial spheres." In p. 189 Nergal is addressed as "great prince of the greatest gods, who has brought up the greatest gods." In his ' La Magie,' p. 175, he gives an address to <span class="accented">Silik-mulu-ki</span>, regarded as an Accadian name of Marduk, in which he is called "god of gods." In his ' Hibbert Lecture,' pp. 97-104, Professor Sayce, on the contrast between the religion of Babylon and that of Persia in this respect, says that Nebuchadnezzar calls Merodach "lord of all," yet declares him the "son of the gods." The same titles are given to Merodach and to Samas, and yet Samas is distinct from Merodach - he is his comrade in the struggle with the assailants of Otis, the moon-god. At the same time, we must observe the limitations of Nebuchadnezzar's praise - it is simply as the Revealer of secrets that he praises and honours the God of Daniel.

The Septuagint renders the last clause of ver. 48 "chief and ruler (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) of all the wise men of Babylon," reading <span class="accented">us gan</span> instead of <span class="accented">signeen.</span> Theodotion's is a fairly accurate rendering of the Massoretic text, as is also Jerome. The Peshitta renders this clause, "He made Daniel head over all the mighty men (<span class="accented">rabiheela</span>), and over all the wise men of Babylon." The translator must have inserted, or found before him inserted, the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">el</span>), "over," between <span class="accented">tab</span> and <span class="accented">signeen</span>, evidently a false reading, due to ignorance of the form Babylonianand Assyrian titles assumed. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span>, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>:, was originally maintained to be Persian. Hitzig connects it with an Arabic root, <span class="accented">sajan</span>, but the true derivation is now found to be <span class="accented">shokun</span> (Assyrian), "<span class="accented">governor."</span> It appears in Hebrew in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the deutero-Isaiah, as well as in Ezra and Nehemiah, showing the unlikelihood of any Persian derivation. Hitzig appears to regard Daniel as made the king's regent over the whole empire of Babylon; but this is not at all the meaning of the words. We must not be led away to  believe that all this promotion befell Daniel at once; the statement here is summary, and includes many steps, and perhaps several years. Even at the utmost of his exaltation, he is not represented here as being made the regent of Nebuchadnezzar. as Hitzig would maintain. It is really only the province of Babylon, if we may not restrict the meaning of the word <span class="accented">medeena</span> even further, and regard it as equivalent to "city." We admit that this restriction of significance is not supported by the versions, but the fact that in so many cases we have traces of Syriac influences in Daniel, and that <span class="accented">medeena</span> means in Syriac "a city," renders this supposition not an impossible one. The precise limits of the province of Babylon in the days of Nebuchadnezzar cannot be settled. In later times it consisted mainly of the territory between the Tigris and the Euphrates, south of the <span class="accented">murus Medius</span>, with some territory between the latter river and the desert (Professor Rawlinson). It may be that the satrapy of Babylon was of considerably less extent. The word <span class="accented">hashleet</span> means "to cause to rule." This would be made true by making Daniel overseer in any department of the government of the province. It is not necessary to maintain that Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel satrap of Babylonia; at the same time, <span class="accented">shalet</span> is the title given to the satrap of Babylon. M. Lenormant thinks there must be an interpolation when Daniel is said to be set over all the governors of the wise men in Babylon. His arguments are founded mainly on the belief that the castes of astrologers, soothsayers, and magians - all that were included in the class of <span class="accented">hakmeen -</span> were hereditary, a thing which has not been proved. A difficulty has been urged by Lenormant that Daniel, as a zealous Jew, could not become head of a college of idolatrous priests. While there may be some force in this, one must beware of testing the actions of a Jew of the  <span class="date">sixth century B.C.</span> by criteria and principles applicable to one of later times. At all events, this militates strongly against the idea that the Book of Daniel was written in the age of the Maccabees. When we see Daniel thus, a youth of probably two or three and twenty, promoted ultimately to be over the province of Babylon, and to be one of the king's most trusted councillors, Ezekiel's saying, which places him between Noah and Job (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>), becomes natural. Daniel had already been some years in the king's privy council before Ezekiel was carried into captivity. We do not know how long after the beginning of his prophetic work we are to date the prophecy of the fourteenth chapter - it may have been eight or nine years after. But even if it were only six years, Daniel would by this time have been for eleven years a member of the privy council of the Babylonian monarch, and possibly for a considerable portion of that period governor of the province of Babylon. At any rate, Daniel would bulk very large in the eyes of the poor Jewish captives. Though contemporary, he was so far removed from his fellow-countrymen in social position, that his goodness and greatness would be subject to similar exaggeration to that which happens to heroes of a long-past age. A better argument may be drawn from the fact that <span class="accented">sagan</span> is always a civil title. The insertion of the word <span class="accented">hakmeen</span> might easily be due to some scribe who thought that as Daniel was one of the wise men, head of them would be more likely than head of the civil governors of the province, and placed it as a suggestion of what ought to take the place of <span class="accented">signeen</span>; a copyist following, inserted it in the text. If we compare this chapter with the sixth, we find Daniel one of three who were to receive the accounts of the various governors. Daniel was thus, if we may apply to his office a title drawn from our own political usage, secretary of state for Babylonia. It is characteristic of Daniel, that having been made rich and great by the king, and having received many gifts at the hand of the king, does not satisfy him; he entreats favour for his friends also. Hitzig's objection that Daniel would have the appointment of his subordinates, would only be valid if Daniel had been made satrap If his <span class="accented">shaletship</span> extended merely to some one department of governmental work - and that seems to follow from the last clause of this verse - it is unlikely that he would have this power. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego are set over the "business" ('<span class="accented">el</span>,<span class="accented">eedt</span>,') of the province of Babylon. This word, in Targumic Aramaic, is very generally used of constructions where labour is employed. We may regard their position as one something like being members of a labour bureau. Nebuchadezzar was a very great builder, so much so that almost all the bricks that have been got in Babylon are stamped with his name. While his Ninevite predecessors record in their inscriptions their campaigns, the kings they conquered, and the cities they sacked, the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar are almost entirely occupied with the various structures - temples, palaces, ramparts, and canals - which he had caused to be made. These buildings would need perpetual surveying. Further, as a great military genius, roads and canals would also be. important objects, in the carrying out of which captives would be employed. And the products of this enforced labour would have to be surveyed carefully. This seems  more probable than that Daniel got these three friends appointed to do the work he himself was appointed to. The only plausible suggestion against this would be that Daniel desired that his friends be <span class="accented">set</span> jointly over the province of Babylon instead of himself, and, for his own part, he preferred to remain in the gate of the king. We know that those who wished to undermine a favourite in an Eastern court, frequently intrigued to get him promoted to a governorship, and then poisoned the mind of the king against him. On the other hand. the fact that Daniel had his province in Babylon, and would always be near the king when he was in his capital, rendered the implied precaution needless. <span class="accented">But Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</span> The gate of the king was the gate of his palace or the entrance to the central court from which all the apartments branched off. In the gate the kings of the East acted as judges over their people; in the gate the king held councils. Hence to sit in the gate of the king conveyed the twofold idea of being the king's representative on the throne of judgment, and of being the counsellor of the king - member of the privy council, to employ a modern term. <p> <p>

The Septuagint Version is full of redundance and interpolation, "In the eighteenth year King Nebuchadnezzar, who ruled cities and countries, and all those dwelling (in them)over the earth from India even to Ethiopia, made a golden image; the height of it was sixty cubits, and the breadth of it six cubits, and set it up in a plain within the boundary of the province of Babylon." The reason for translating <span class="accented">Dura</span> "boundary, is natural enough, for the word. means something approximate to this. Theodotion begins in the same way, giving the date "the eighteenth year;" the place is <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1fb7;</span>, As for the rest, it is in agreement with the text of the Massoretes. The Peshitta follows a text that must have been identical with the Massoretic, as also does the Vulgate. The date inserted into the Greek Version is improbable. At that time, if we take the chronology of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>, Nebuchadnezzar was engaged in the siege of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was taken in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, after a two years' siege. In <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-29.htm">Jeremiah 52:29</a> we are told, however, that Nebuchadnezzar took eight hundred and thirty-two captives in his eighteenth year, and the difference between Babylonian and Jewish chronology suggests that the eighteenth year of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52.htm">Jeremiah 52</a>. may be the nineteenth of <a href="../../par/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a> Against this is the fact that the month of the year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar is given (<a href="../../par/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8</a>), and this implies the adoption of the Babylonian chronology. It is certainly not to be expected that Nebuchadnezzar would traverse the long distance that separated him from his capital merely to erect a statue or obelisk. At the same time, we are told (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-29.htm">Jeremiah 52:29</a>), as we have mentioned above, that in the eighteenth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar took eight hundred and thirty-two persons captive. This may be that he sent these prisoners by a convoy, for it is clear that a larger number of captives were taken when Jerusalem was captured than eight Hundred and thirty-two. They may have been taken during the progress of the siege, in sallies, etc. The number of prisoners taken in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar does not suggest the great numbers that are implied in Ezekiel to be dwelling on the Chebar, otherwise we might be inclined to regard these differences from the received chronology as due to a different mode of reckoning. Even though the date given in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-29.htm">Jeremiah 52:29</a> were the date of the capture of Jerusalem, it is not at all likely that the capture of an obscure city in the hill country of Judaea was an event on account of which a special thanksgiving would be given. The description of the empire of Nebuchadnezzar in the Septuagint is borrowed  from <a href="../../par/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>. In regard to this image, the statement that it is "golden" does not mean that it was solid gold, any more than the golden altar (<a href="../../par/numbers/4-11.htm">Numbers 4:11</a>) was entirely of gold (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-1.htm">Exodus 30:1-3</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/37-25.htm">Exodus 37:25, 26</a>); that it was an "image" (<span class="accented">tzelem</span>) does not necessarily imply that it was a statue in the form of a human being. In <a href="../../par/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a> there are references to <span class="accented">tzalmee zakar</span>, which seem naturally to be <span class="accented">phallus</span> images. Hegel's opinion ('&AElig;sthetik') was that the obelisk was really a modified <span class="accented">phallus</span> image. If that is so, then the proportions of this <span class="accented">tzele</span> are not extravagant for an obelisk. Moreover, these numbers, "sixty" and "six," are evidently round numbers, their mnemonic character maintaining their place. The real numbers might be anything near the number given; instead of "sixty," the real number might be not much over "fifty" cubits, and the "six" cubits the number given as the breadth, might be, without intentional deception, seven or eight cubits. The proportion, at all events, in the extreme case of fifty and eight cubits, would not be extraordinary, even for a statue. It might be a gilded statue on a lofty column. One other note may be added: 6 and 60, multiplied together, give 360, the number of the days in the Babylonian year. The division of the circle into 360 degrees is probably due to this Babylonian division of the year. <span class="accented">In the plain of Dura.</span> There are several places in Babylonia which may be identified with this (Schrader, 'Keilin-schriften,' 430). While it may be outside the wall of the city, this <span class="accented">Dura</span> may also have been within it; the Septuagint rendering favours thistly  -  <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, It is remarked by Professor Fuller that districts within the city of Babylon have at times "Dun" as part of the name. Thus, "in Esarhaddon's inscriptions, Duru-suanna-ki is that part of Babylon which is elsewhere called Imgur-Bel, or wall of Babylon." This would confirm the view  - Quatremere's - that Duru was within the city wall. Archdeacon Rose ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">ad</span> loc.) refers to Oppert as having found near a spot named Duair the pedestal of a colossal statue, but gives no reference. On the fiat plains of Mesopotamia, this obelisk of a hundred feet high would be seen for nearly thirteen miles in every direction, and the gleam from its gilded top would be visible even further. What was the occasion of this image being set up? We have no means of even conjecturing. Certainly it was not merely to seduce the Jews again into idolatry. From the way Marduk (Merodach) is glorified in the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar, the probability is that it was erected in his honour. Bishop Wordsworth ('Com. Daniel') thinks the statue was of Nebuchadnezzar himself, and quotes Lenormant ('Manuel d'Histoire Ancienne,' 1:237, trans, 1:486). Lenormaut, in the passage referred to, quotes an ins,,ription in which Nebuchadnezzar calls himself "the begotten of Marduk" From this Lenormant comes to the conclusion that, like Caligula in later times, Nebuchadnezzar demanded worship to be given to himself as a god. But when we turn back in this same book ('Manuel d'Histoire Ancienne,' vol. 1. p. 484, Engl. trans.), we find a number of statements of a similar kind which invalidate the emphasis which Lenormant would give to this. He calls <span class="accented">Bilit Larpanit</span>, "the mother who bore me;" <span class="accented">Sin</span>, "who inspires me with judgment;" <span class="accented">Shamash</span>, "who inspires my body with the sentiment of justice:" and so on. In saying he was begotten of Marduk, it is not as claiming the personal possession of the characteristics of divinity that Nebuchadnezzar made this statement, but as regarding himself to be the special instrument and favourite of the gods - a posture of mind quite compatible with the deepest and most real humility. Hippolytus and Jerome maintain the same view as Lenormant on <span class="accented">a priori</span> evidence. There is no contradiction between Nebuchadnezzar's ascription of praise to Jehovah as a God of gods and a Revealer of secrets, in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>, and his erection of this image to Merodaeh That Jehovah was a God of gods did not prevent Merodach being that also, and even greater.

The phrase, "nations. peoples, and tongues," is one that occurs with great frequency in Revelation, and also the above phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. This is an indication of the use made by the Apostle John of this version of Daniel as distinct from the Massoretic text It may also be observed that the phrase, "all in the whole inhabited earth," is placed as equal to "all the rulers of the provinces," which makes it at least possible that a misreading of the original text has occasioned the exaggeration in this particular clause. In the third verse the order is different, and to some extent the names of the officials are different also; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is left out, and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> appears in its stead, though not in the same place. Further, there are persons mentioned "great in authority." This variation may be due to an uncertainty in the mind of the translator as to the exact equivalent in Greek for the Aramaic terms. It is to be noted that "the inhabitants of the whole earth" disappear from this repetition. The last editor of the Greek text may have had two renderings before him, and drew from the one the second verse, and from the other the third. Theodotion's rendering, while in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, yet differs from it to some extent, appearing to make the latter half of ver. 2 explanatory of the former, which contains the more technical designations. In ver. 3 there is a change in the order of the terms, as to some extent a change in the terms. In the Peshitta there are evident traces that the translator had not understood the technical meaning of the terms here used. The list given is "great men of might - lords, rulers, <span class="accented">Agardaei</span>, <span class="accented">Garabdaei</span>, <span class="accented">Tarabdaei</span>, <span class="accented">Tabathaei</span>, and all the rulers of the province." These mysterious names, that seem those of tribes, have no existence elsewhere. It is singular that these words, if they are in their original shape - which they seem certainly, to be  - and to appearance of Persian origin, were unintelligible to one writing on the Persian frontier at most three centuries after the critical date of Daniel. The Parthian Empire retained much of the Persian character. How was it that words of Persian meaning had disappeared there, and still remained in use, or at least still continued to be intelligible, in Palastine? The probability is that the names have undergone so great change in course of transcription that their original form can no longer be recognized. The Vulgate does not call for remark. The names of these different grades of officials are (as we now have them) some indubitably Persian, as <span class="accented">ahashdarpan</span>; others unmistakably Assyrian, <span class="accented">sagan pehah</span>; and there are some that have no recognized etymology, as <span class="accented">tiphtaye</span>: but there are none that are even plausibly derived from Greek. Yet this class of words is precisely the class where the influence of the language of the military governing nation would be manifest. The fact that while the Massoretic text has eight classes of rulers who are summoned, the Septuagint has only six, throws a suspicion on the whole list. The LXX., however, adds, "all those in the whole earth (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)," which may be the result of misreading of <span class="accented">kol shiltoni medeen-atha</span>, or it may be a rendering of it, referring back to the classes already enumerated (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> being understood, omitting the <span class="accented">ray</span>). In Theodotion and Jerome there are seven classes. Only in the Peshitta are there the same number of classes as in the Massoretic. The Peshitta has as this first class <span class="accented">rabai heela</span>, used in the New Testament, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/luke/22-4.htm">Luke 22:4</a>, of "chief captains." It is possible that <span class="accented">rabuti</span>, or some derivative from it, was in the original text here, and this was changed into the better known <span class="accented">sotrap. Sagan</span> does not call for remark; as said above (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>), it is derived from <span class="accented">shakun</span> (Assyrian); the Hebrew equivalent appears in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-23.htm">Jeremiah 51:23</a> and <a href="../../par/ezekiel/23-6.htm">Ezekiel 23:6</a>, and elsewhere. <span class="accented">Pebah</span> is also Assyrian in origin, also elsewhere used in Scripture. <span class="accented">Adargazrayya</span> seems a compound from <span class="accented">adar</span> and <span class="accented">gazar</span>, "to divide." Furst would make this word mean" astrologers of the god Adar." Professor Bevan would derive it from <span class="accented">endarz-gar</span>, a Persian word meaning "counsellor"  - "a word which was still in use under the Sassanians." That the word had any connection with this is disproved by the fact that in the Peshitta it is rendered <span class="accented">Agardaei.</span> If the word in question had survived from the Achaemenids to the Sassanids, its meaning would necessarily be known to the Peshitta translator, whose date held between the periods of these two Persian dynasties. A Persian word of the date of the Achsemenids to have survived to the age of the Sassanids, must have been known in the intervening Parthian period. A similar difficulty occurs in regard to the next word, <span class="accented">gedabrayya - the</span> Syrian translator has simply transferred it. The simplest interpretation is that it is a variation on <span class="accented">gizbarayya</span> (<a href="../../par/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>), and means "treasurers," which is still in use in the Syriac of the Peshitta, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>. The question is complicated by the fact that the word which occupies the same place in the similar list in ver. 27 is <span class="accented">had-dabra</span> When we turn to the Peshitta for that verse, there is another word, <span class="accented">raur-bona.</span> <[<span class="accented">Vol13/Daniel/97]PGBR>  The Septuagint, by rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, shows that their reading was <span class="accented">habereen.</span> All this proves how utterly futile it is to build anything on the presence of late words in Daniel. The presence of early words from the nature of the case, is more significant. Old and unintelligible words would never be inserted in place of new and intelligible, though the reverse process might readily take place: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">dethaberayya</span>) is rendered usually "judges," and is generally derived from the Pehlevi; but if <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">dath</span>) means a "firman," a "command," or "decree," in Aramaic, then the addition <span class="accented">bar</span> in Persian is rendered less certain. Here, again, the Peshitta translator was unaware of the meaning of the word, and renders by the mysterious word <span class="accented">tarabdaei.</span> The last class mentioned is the <span class="accented">Tiphtae.</span> This term seems to be omitted in the three Western versions at least there are only six names of ranks of rulers given in these versions, and this is a seventh. Of course, it may be that some name earlier in the list is explanatory and added later than the time when these versions were made. The Peshitta has the word <span class="accented">Tabathaei</span>, which has all the appearance of a national name. The word <span class="accented">Tiphtae</span> assumes in the K'thib a Syriac form, which, as we before remarked, is an indication of the original dialect of the book. Notwithstanding what Professor Bevan has asserted, something may be said for the conjecture that it is connected with <span class="accented">afta</span>, "to advise." But in the extreme doubt in which we are in regard to what the text precisely is, it is something like waste of time to do more than chronicle opinions. This feeling of uncertainty is increased by the fact that, as above mentioned, the two lists in the two verses before us do not agree in the three Western versions. The list in ver. 27 purports to be the same as that given here, and differs from it greatly. All that we may assume is that there were assembled different classes of the officials of the Babylonian Empire. The reading should not be <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "of the provinces;" but <span class="accented">medeenta</span> "of the province;" the officials that were assembled were those merely of the province of Babylon. We would maintain this, although the versions are against it, because there would be no difference in the original unpointed text.

It is clear that the Septuagint translator rendered <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> as "host," and translated <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span> as if it were <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>. The balanced cadence of the next clause seems more natural, if due to the Aramaic source than to the Greek translator. The musical instruments are also arranged in the same cadenced fashion, broken to some extent by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.

The Peshitta in the fourth verse agrees not only word for word, but we might almost say syllable for syllable, with the Massoretic text. In the fifth verse it omits <span class="accented">pesanterin</span>; instead of <span class="accented">sabka</span>, it has <span class="accented">kinora</span>, which is usually regarded as the Hebrew equivalent of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>; instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, it has <span class="accented">tziphonia</span>, which suggests a different etymology. It is true Strack ('Neu Hebraische Sprache') points out that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> has a tendency to become <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> before syllables with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> sound or at the end of words, but this is neither of these; the syllable with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> is the first, not the last, and there is no <span class="accented">d</span> or <span class="accented">t</span> sound in the word. Jerome is in strict verbal agreement with the Massoretic text. We shall have to devote a short excursus to the names of the musical instruments which occur here. In eagerness to find proofs of the late origin of the Book of Daniel - of its origin in the times of the Hellenic domination, <span class="accented">karoza</span> was derived from .<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3be;</span>, that etymology is universally abandoned now. <span class="accented">O</span> <span class="accented">people</span>, <span class="accented">nations</span>, <span class="accented">and languages.</span> It ought rather to be <span class="accented">peoples.</span> Bishop Wordsworth remarks on the resemblance which this phrase bears to tsar used of the mystical Babylon in Revelation (Revelation 13:7; 17:15), and adds that she also "commands them to fall down and worship the image which she has set up." In regard to the following verse, the sculptures of Nineveh prove the prominence given to music in all important occasions, as the celebration of a triumph or the dedication of a temple. The names of the musical instruments are not so generally preserved. It was most likely when the rays of the morning sun smote the golden tip of the obelisk, that there came the burst of music which was to serve as a signal for all the multitudes to fall down and worship. The image was looked upon as the sign of the god it represented; it received the worship meant for him.

The only difference between the Septuagint and  the Massoretic text is that instead of rendering, "shall be cast," it is put in the plural active, "they shall cast him." There may have been a difference of reading - <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d0;</span>. It is, perhaps, more probable that it is simply that the translator preferred this construction to the one which would have resulted from a more literal translation. Theodotion,the Peshitta, and Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. <span class="accented">In that very hour.</span> It has been suggested by Professor Fuller that the way the shadow fell would enable them to fix the hour. This, however, is giving an exact astronomical meaning to what had only a rhetorical significance. The word <span class="accented">sha'a</span> is very vague; it means "time" in general, it means "any short interval of time," from some days to a moment. <span class="accented">Shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> is of uncertain derivation; it is found in both dialects of Aramaic. It occurs in the Targum of pseudo-Jonathan, in the story of the death of Haran and the preservation of Abraham, which seems distinctly imitated from the events related here. In Smith's 'Life of Asshurbanipal,' we find this punishment more than once resorted to, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> pp. 163, 164. Professor Bevan maintains, in answer to Lenormant's appeal to this as a proof of the author's accurate knowledge of Babylonian methods of punishment, that this is derived from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-22.htm">Jeremiah 29:22</a>, Zedekiah and Ahab, "whom the King of Babylon roasted in the fire." Only the action implied by the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">qalah</span>) is not complete burning, as that implied in the punishment before us, but rather the more cruel torture of slowly burning The word is used of "parched corn" (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="../../par/judges/5-11.htm">Judges 5:11</a>); it is used also of the heat of fever (<a href="../../par/psalms/38-8.htm">Psalm 38:8</a>). There is no verbal indication that the author of Daniel was at all influenced by this passage.

It is possible <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is due to another reading, but may also have been the result of a desire for variation. Theodotion does not differ from the Massoretic text The two Greek versions agree with the Massoretic in omitting <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The rendering of the Peshitta is, "In the hour when the nations heard the voice of the horn, and flute, and lyre, (<span class="accented">qithra</span>), and harp (<span class="accented">kinnor</span>), and pipe (<span class="accented">tziphonia</span>), and all kinds of music, all these peoples, nations, and tongues, fell down and worshipped the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up" It is to be noted that <span class="accented">kinnor</span>, its Shemitic equivalent, here again follows <span class="accented">qithra</span>, and that <span class="accented">pesanterin is</span> again omitted. Jerome, in opposition to the Massoretic and the Greek versions, inserts <span class="accented">symphonia.</span> In regard to the Massoretic text here, as in the fifth verse, we have <span class="accented">qathros</span> instead of the <span class="accented">qithros</span> of the K'thib; in this, the K'thib agrees, as generally, with the Eastern instead of the Western form the word assumes. Professor Bevan compares the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> here with that in the Palmyrene inscriptions (Vogue 15). <span class="accented">Zemara is</span> said by Keil to refer only to song; but Furst, Gesenius, and Wirier apply the word to instrumental music. It may, as a matter of fact, be either; if it be a chorus of voices, it is then equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. This verse simply chronicles the obedience that was at once and unquestioningly rendered to the command of Nebuchadnezzar. The obedience of these Gentiles served to bring out into clearer relief the steadfastness of these Jews, or, what appears to the king and his courtiers, their obstinacy. Not impossibly, their resistance to the king was emphasized by their remaining standing amid the crowd of those prostrate officials.

The latter has nothing to represent the <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5da;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">kol-qobayl d'nah</span>) of the original, which appears in our versions as "wherefore." The Septuagint renders <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. The Peshitta also has omitted "wherefore;" in the next clause it is slavishly accurate, giving the peculiar turn of the phrase in the original, '<span class="accented">achalu qartzchun</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> devour pieces of them." It occurs in the Syriac of <a href="../../par/luke/16-1.htm">Luke 16:1</a>; it is in the Targum of <a href="../../par/psalms/15-3.htm">Psalm 15:3</a>. The Vulgate presents no points worthy of notice. It is evident that "Chaldean" is here used in its ethnic sense of the nation, not in its professional sense as of the alleged class. We must remember that "Chaldean" is not equivalent to "Babylonian." As we have seen, the Chaldeans were intruders in Babylon, and to them Nebuchadnezzar belonged. It was but natural that native-born Chaldeans, who reckoned <span class="accented">themselves</span> to be of the same kin as the king, objected to have their  rights postponed to a set of Jews. The fact that the three friends are not named, or in any way designated, but the whole Jewish race is referred to, shows that the purpose of these Chaldeans involved the whole Jewish people, and that they singled out Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego simply as test cases. Their elevation to positions Of such trust might well have caused jealousy of them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9</a></div><div class="verse">They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.

There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee; they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up</span>. The differences here between the Septuagint and the Massoretic are slight. Only, it may be observed, that in the repetition of the decree to the king, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> does not occur. Instead of saying, "they serve not thy gods," it renders, "thine idol they do not serve." Further, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> ('<span class="accented">abeedath</span>), translated "business," is omitted, probably implying the omission in the original text of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>. Theodotion's Version is considerably briefer in regard to the ninth verse, as it omits "answered and said," and "Nebuchadnezzar;" otherwise it is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, only it too omits <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. In the Peshitta we find a variation in the ninth verse; its rendering begins, "And they said to Nebuchadnezzar the king." As before mentioned, in the list of instruments <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is omitted, and <span class="accented">kinnor</span> appears; otherwise the agreement is close with the Massoretic text. The Vulgate agrees with the Peshitta in its rendering of the ninth verse, but, unlike the Greek Version, inserts <span class="accented">symphonia</span>, and unlike the Peshitta, inserts <span class="accented">psalterium.</span> As to the Aramaic text, the most noticeable thing is the fact that in the K'thib, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">sumphonia</span>) there appears <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">siphonia</span>). The twelfth verse has this peculiarity in it, that it is the only case where <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, the sign of the accusative, so frequent in the Targums, occurs in Biblical Aramaic. In the inscription on the Hadad Statue at Sindschirli, line 28, we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">v-th-h</span>) as the sign of the acensative; as in the case before us, it serves for the oblique case of a pronoun. The adulatory address with which these Chaldeans begin is quite in accordance with Eastern usage. The point of the accusation against these three officials was that, being officials, they did not confirm by obedience the solemn decree of the monarch. Further, if this statue or obelisk were erected to Marduk (Merodach), whom Nebuchadnezzar specially worshipped, and whom he regarded as his special protector, the element of treason against the state might be implied in this refusal to give due obeisance to the tutelary god of the Babylonian Empire and its sovereign. The politics and warfare of that period proceeded on the assumption that the gods directly interfered in the affairs of the nations. Any slight done to the national god would - as it was believed - be avenged on the nation who had suffered it to pass unpunished. They summoned deities to leave cities they were besieging, and tried to persuade the inhabitants that even their god was on the side of the besieger. Thus Sennacherib (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22</a>) asserts that Jehovah must be offended with Hezekiah. and Pharaoh-Necho claimed to Josiah that he went at God's command to fight against Assyria (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>). According to heathen notions generally, Chaldean and Babylonian included, some very slight inadvertence might vitiate a sacrifice, and change it from being a propitiation to the gods to an offence to them. If an inadvertence might thus be maleficent, much more direct disrespect such as that shown by these Jewish officials. But the accusers lay stress on another side of the matter. Nebuchadnezzar had set them over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but he had set up the golden image. There was thus an element of personal disrespect hinted at, made all the more heinous that the element of ingratitude was also present. But how is it that Daniel is not introduced into this narrative? Why was it that he was not attacked rather than his friends? It may be argued that this is another tradition, and that the union of Daniel with the three friends is due to that dovetailing of which so many traces are found - or alleged to be found - in the Pentateuch. But the editor who did the dovetailing in the present instance, did more than dovetail - they are introduced at various points in the narrative of the preceding chapter. Why did he not complete his work, and explain why Daniel was absent? If it is a work of imagination, it is necessary to account for the absence of Daniel; even if it is the result of editorial labour, still the absence of Daniel has to be accounted for or explained away. This would press heavily on one writing in the days of the Maccabees. On one chronicling events as they occurred, this might easily be passed over, because at the time every one in Babylon would be perfectly aware why Daniel was not there. The absence of all reference to Daniel in this chapter is an indirect proof of the antiquity and genuineness of the book of which it forms part. The reasons for Daniel's absence may easily be imagined. He might have been sent on official duty to a distant province of the empire, or, though this is not so likely, his presence at this festival might not be required A prosaic but possible solution of Daniel's absence might be illness. If he were known to be incapacitated by sickness from taking part in any public function, the Chaldeans would not damage their case by referring to him.

Then they brought these men before the king.</span> The Septuagint differs from the Massoretic in translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hama</span>) as a verb, and therefore rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1fc7;</span>, "infuriated with rage." Theodotion is in close agreement with the Massoretic, as also the Pe-shitta, with this difference, that the Syriac repeats the preposition, in which it is followed by Jerome. The word translated. "brought" presents some grammatical difficulty: the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">haythayoo</span>). The form seems active, but the meaning is passive. Professor Bevan suggests a difference of vocalization. The accusation of those who desired to devour these Jewish councillors was successful in its immediate aim. Nebuchadnezzar is filled with rage and fury against those who, having been the creatures of his favour, had yet dared to do despite to his authority. It might even be that their unheard-of want of courtesy to the monarch would also be regarded as discourtesy still more flagrant to the god to whose honour the statue or pillar had been erected, and this dedicative feast instituted. He commands the criminals to be brought to him. Fierce and furious as Nebuchadnezzar is, fanatic as he is for the religion of his fathers, he is yet just. These officials, however disrespectfully they have acted, have yet a right to be heard in their own defence. They are sent for by the monarch, and in due course they come. It is not impossible that Nebuchadnezzar, with all his rage and fury, was yet shrewd enough to see envy behind the accusation; it is because these men are Jews, and have been highly advanced, that the Chaldeans are ready to bring accusations of impiety against them. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-14.htm">Daniel 3:14</a></div><div class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, <i>Is it</i> true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</span> The Septuagint rendering here is, "Whom when he saw, Nebuchadnezzar the king said to them, Wherefore, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do ye not worship my gods, nod before the golden image which I have set up do ye not prostrate yourselves?" There seems to have been a difference of reading here. The first words must have been read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">behon</span> '<span class="accented">aleehon</span>), and the mysterious word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">hatzeda</span>) <span class="accented">had</span> occupied a position before, not after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> in the aphel in Syriac means "to look steadily." This interpretation of the word shows that the translator had before him a document in which Syriac meanings might be expected. Theodotion renders the last clause, "If truly (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>) Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, my gods ye do not worship, and before the golden image which I have set up ye do not prostrate yourselves?" - a construction that shows a slavish following of the Aramaic. The sense here is really the same as that of the Authorized Version. The Peshitta renders the opening word of this latter portion of the verse, "in truth" - a rendering with which Jerome agrees. Professor Bevan suggests another reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, followed by Behrmann. Unfortunately, the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> is very doubtful. The common rendering is "of set purpose." So Furst, Gesenius, Winer, among lexicographers, and Bertholdt, Ewald, Aben Ezra, Wordsworth, among commentators; Keil, Kliefoth, Kra-nichfeld, hold it to mean "with evil intent." It is suggested also that it may mean "in mockery." The reading suggested by Professor Bevan and supported by Behrmann is not to be thought of; they appeal to Theodotion, but when this word occurs in the previous chapter (ver. 5), Theodotion translates <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, which makes it evident that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">azda</span>) did not mean "truth" to him. More may be said for the Peshitta, only that, though <span class="accented">azda</span> does seem to mean "truth," the translation is not the same in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> and the present verse. If there is to be a change of reading, that indicated by the Septuagint translation is preferable. The Septuagint translator has had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span> before him, and there is no evidence that Theodotion had not. The change in the arrangement of the words is a simpler variation than any other, and it retains the word in its Syriac meaning; otherwise we should be inclined to follow the lexicographers, and translate "of set purpose." If we take the view of this word indicated above, then we may imagine Nebuchadnezzar looking steadfastly on those youths who had dared to oppose him, hoping, it may be, to see them shrink from his gaze, as he had seen so many of the kings he had conquered do.  If this is correct, it gives a point to what the youths begin their answer with in ver. 16. If we take the more common rendering, we see the generosity of the king. Full of rage and fury as he is, he will give them an opening to say that it was of inadvertence that they failed to obey his decree. This is fully borne out by the next verse. If Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury at the crime against the gods, he yet was careful that the envy of the Chaldeans should not hinder him from giving the Jews who had been accused to him a chance to defend themselves. This mental fairness it was which, despite his outbursts of capricious rage, drew the affection of those about him to Nebuchadnezzar. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-15.htm">Daniel 3:15</a></div><div class="verse">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; <i>well</i>: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who <i>is</i> that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be east the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</span> The differences between the Septuagint and the Massoretic text are not great. The last clause is rendered," but if not, know." It inserts the epithet "golden" after "image." The insertion of "know <span class="accented">ye"</span> makes the sentence run more easily, but it is not to be accepted. Here, as before, "midst" is omitted. Theodotion is very close to the Massoretic, but agrees with the Septuagint in its omission of "midst" and its insertion of "golden." The Peshitta is in yet closer agreement with the Massoretic text, save in regard to the musical instruments <span class="accented">- p'santerin</span>, as in the other cases, being omitted. It seems clear from this that the festival of the dedication of this new idol of the Babylonian king occupied several days. Nebuchadnezzar, willing to save those Jews, is ready to condone their first failure to obey his command if, probably at the sunrise of the following day, they were willing when they heard the sound of the musical instruments to fall down and worship this golden image which he had set up to the honour of his god. The latter clause does not seem in perfect harmony with the tone of the earlier part of the verse. There has been no reference in the conversation as reported to any other god to explain Nebuchadnezzar's demand, "Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?" Moreover, there is in the beginning a desire apparent to give these Jewish officials a way of escape, but in the last clause there is contempt as well as anger expressed. The fact is that while the simple structure of Shemitic lends itself to direct narration, the reader is not to suppose that, though speeches are reported in the <span class="accented">oratio recta</span>, they any more record or claim to record the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> than if the speeches had been recorded in the <span class="accented">oratio obliqua</span> of more Western tongues. The presumption is that merely the main heads of the conversation are recorded. These very jolts and leaps are in themselves indirect evidences of the truth of the document with which we have to do. It would have been easy to insert a question and answer to bridge over the hiatus. Only one recording facts would be regardless of this. The attitude of mind expressed by these last words of Nebuchadnezzar are natural to a heathen, and especially to monarchs of the Assyrian type. Sennacherib's words of defiance (<a href="../../par/2_kings/18-33.htm">2 Kings 18:33</a>) are quite in the same line, "Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the King of Assyria?" The capture of Jerusalem by his arms was regarded by Nebuchadnezzar as a demonstration that the God of Israel was inferior to the gods of Babylonia. To Nebuchadnezzar this belief would not in the slightest degree contradict his previous declaration (<a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a>), that this same God was "a God of gods, and a Lord of kings." He might be great as a Revealer of secrets, but not in might to deliver - in that he was clearly inferior to the gods of Babylon, as the events of recent campaigns had abundantly proved. It is this declaration, with the idea behind it of the ]imitation of Jehovah, that gives the event narrated in this chapter its importance. <span class="accented">Excursus on the Musical Instruments in this Chapter.</span> The names of the musical instruments which occur in the fifth, seventh, tenth, and fifteenth verses of this chapter are supposed to afford a demonstrative proof of the late date of Daniel. Thus Canon Driver, by no means an extreme critic, declares that, while "the Hebrew and Aramaic permit" a late date, these Greek words "demand" that the date of Daniel be placed as late as the period of the Syrian power. The words in question <span class="accented">are - qathros</span>, <span class="accented">pesanterin</span>, <span class="accented">sum-phonya.</span> The first of these, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="accented">qath'ros</span>), appears to be transferred from the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), from its resemblance to the older form, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which occurs in Homer: we may deduce that the word, if borrowed from the Greek, was borrowed at an early period. Canon Driver would not, in view of the intercourse between Greece and Babylon, press this word as proof of the recent date of Daniel. The intercourse between Babylon and Greece was sufficiently great to have rendered the conveyance of this name at least not impossible. It has been shown,  moreover, by Professor Whitehouse, that the word is probably derived from the East; indeed, he fixes on Phoenicia as its source. It must be observed that he maintains that, while originally Phoenician, the form it assumes in Daniel proves it to have come to the author of Daniel from Greek The word may have been modified from its more ancient to its more recent form, for the sake of readers. One of the suggestions of those who oppose the antiquity of the Book of Daniel is that <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kinnor</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> the word that would have been used by a genuine Aramaic writer of Daniel's period, as <span class="accented">kinder</span> and <span class="accented">qitharos</span> (or <span class="accented">qathros</span>) represent one and the same instrument; but, unfortunately for this, in the Peshitta we have both terms, the one after the other. The other words, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">pesanterin</span>), supposed to be equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, are on a different footing. In the first place, any one who has studied the apocalyptic writings, must see how peculiarly liable they are to interpolation. There is hardly one that is not largely and obviously interpolated. No one can deny that this has taken place with. Daniel. The apocryphal additions are too well known for any one to maintain the opposite opinion. When, moreover, one begins to compare the Massoretic text with the more ancient versions, the Septuagint, the Peshitta, and that of Theodotion, we at once see that the changes which the text has undergone have not been confined to large interpolations, but all through there are words and phrases where the versions differ from the Massoretic text and from each other. The text especially from which the Septuagint translation has been made, must have presented many and important verbal differences from that adopted by the Massoretes. Even Theodotion, though his version agrees more closely with the Massoretic text than does the Septuagint, differs from it in ways and in a degree than can at times be explained only on the supposition that the text before him was not identical with that adopted by the Massoretes. The supposition that Theodotion has been altered from the Septuagint has been hazarded, and in a few cases it may have some semblance of probability, but in other cases it is destitute of every shadow of likelihood. The Peshitta is another source of various readings. Its variations are independent of either of the other two versions. In some chapters these variations are more marked than in others, but in every case they are numerous enough to make any stress on individual words highly hazardous. While these variations are known and chronicled, there is no security that no variations occurred even before the types of the text separated from each other. In such a case as this, although it would be unscientific, on the ground of this uncertainty, to proceed to change the text to what seems to make better sense, it is equally unscientific to lay any evidential weight on single words. But, further, no words are, in one respect, less evidential than musical terms. They are changed and modified with a freedom applied to few other things. Thus we have "cornet-a-piston" figuring also as "cornopean," two words like each other in sound, of the same meaning, but of widely different derivation. They pass from country to country with greater freedom than most other terms. To infer, then, that the writer of Daniel wrote under Greek domination, because certain Greek musical terms occur in the present Massoretic text, is rash in the extreme, and would, it seems to us, be universally regarded so, were there not an object to be gained by assuming that evidence drawn from them was liable to no doubt. New Testament critics have taught us to suspect what are called <span class="accented">tendenz</span> documents, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> documents that have an overweening bias towards one side of a controversy: there is such a thing as a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> judgment. The judgment of the critics in regard to the evidential value of these musical terms is a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> judgment, which we should say is even more to be suspected than the contents of a <span class="accented">tendenz</span> document. The history of the argument from the alleged presence of Greek terms in Daniel is also instructive. The number of Greek terms that Hitzig and some earlier critics saw was large. Gradually they had to abandon all but those coming in the list of musical instruments here. Of these only four could be claimed as really Greek. However, one of these had soon to go, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>; it was maintained to be derived from the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>. It was found that this Greek word was really derived from an Eastern, probably an Assyrian, source. Next, it has been acknowledged by Canon Driver, as above stated, that much stress cannot be laid on <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5e1;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>), seeing it is an instrument of such ancient date in Greece, that it might easily have drifted eastward, name and thing, to Babylon. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the word, in all probability, is not Greek, to begin with, but Eastern, probably Phoenician.  In regard to the remaining words <span class="accented">- sumphonya</span> and <span class="accented">pesanterin -</span> it is argued that they are of Greek origin, and that, while Babylonian intercourse with Greece is not denied, the origin of these words is maintained to be late, at all events, in the sense in which they appear in this passage. Thus, <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is declared to be the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and it is further said that <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is not a term applied to musical instruments till late, Aristotle and Theophrastus being the earliest authors that use the word. That this word <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is derived from <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is supposed to be proved by an argument which shows that the Greek letter <span class="greek">&#x3c8;</span> is resolved, in passing into Aramaic, into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span>; second, that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> may be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, and that <span class="accented">-</span><span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> becomes not infrequently <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> Even though all these points be admitted, it does not follow that <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> is derived from <span class="accented">psalterion</span>; as fair a case might be made out for deriving "mystery" from "mist" While <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> sometimes represents -<span class="greek">&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, it much more frequently is simply the sign of the plural; and while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;</span> may be at times the first half of <span class="greek">&#x3c8;</span> resolved, it also does represent at times the Coptic article <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;</span>. While it is not impossible that <span class="accented">santer</span> may represent the remaining letters of the name of the Greek instrument, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;</span> has a meaning in Coptic also; it may mean a chorus <span class="accented">-</span> "those singing to an instrument." This, then, would show that <span class="accented">pesanter</span>,'<span class="accented">n</span> might mean those singing in accompaniment to the previously named instruments. Confirmatory of this is the fact that in Lower Egypt, at the present day, there is a musical instrument called the <span class="accented">santeer.</span> When one remembers the great intercourse that existed between Assyria and Egypt when Esarhaddon and Asshur-bani-pal held possession of Egypt - the former of whom frequently held his court in Babylon - that Egyptian words should come into Babylon would not be extraordinary. We admit readily that possibility is not proof of actuality, yet it weakens the force of the other argument, which also is merely from possibility. A prior question has to be settled before we deduce anything from the origin of this word <span class="accented">pesanteria.</span> Is it really part of the original text? There are in this third chapter of Daniel four distinct lists of what purport to be musical instruments. And these are arranged in such a way that the reader expects them to be identical. Each of these may thus be regarded as separate manuscripts. We have further three old versions, as already mentioned, as well as the Massoretic text: the Septuagint dated about  <span class="date">B.C. 200</span>; Theodotion and the Peshitta, dated about A.D. ; the Massoretic text, being fixed somewhere about A.D. , and represented by manuscripts, the earliest of which is of the tenth century - the Qri and K'thib represent two forms of reading. Of these authorities the latest is the Massoretic text. To begin with the Massoretic text, the first thing that meets us is that, while in the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth verses, the word is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, in the seventh verse it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. This is not so insignificant as at first sight seems, for <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;</span> do not appear to have been pronounced in the same way originally, any more than the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3b8;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;</span>. But further, it is an acknowledged canon of criticism that when a passage has many variations of reading in different manuscripts, that itself raises a suspicion that it has come from the margin into the text. This variation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> in a word is an instance similar to that of varying words in the case of a passage; a varying letter is, in the case of a word, a note conveying suspicion. When we turn to the versions, we find that while the Greek - the Septuagint and Theodotion - have it, the word is quite omitted from the Syriac Peshitta. If it had dropped into the text from the margin, it would be most likely to do so in the Greek versions first, and then find its way into the Massoretic text afterwards. Hence the positive value of the evidence of the Greek versions is comparatively small, although their negative value is considerable. On the other hand, the word is not present at all in the Peshitta, which originated beyond the sphere of Greek domination. That being the state of the matter, we venture to maintain that the word <span class="accented">pesanterin</span> does not belong to the genuine text of Daniel. The case against <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> is yet stronger. In regard to this word there is a divergence between the Q'ri and the K'thib. Hence we may regard this as a case in which we have twenty manuscripts. If we now examine the evidence supplied by these, we shall find that the evidence for the presence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5e4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span> in the original text is very weak. In the K'thib, which represents in general the better text, we have <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> only in two cases, in one case we have <span class="accented">siphonya</span>, in the fourth case nothing at all. In the Q'ri we have three cases of <span class="accented">sumpboaya.</span> When we turn to the Greek texts, we find that <span class="accented">symphonia</span> occurs in the Septuagint in two cases, in Theodotion only in one case. When we turn to the Peshitta, we have no case of <span class="accented">sumphonia</span>, but we have in all cases <span class="accented">tsiphoaia</span>, a form akin to what we find in the tenth verse in the Massoretic text. If, then, we take these various cases together, and sum them up, we lind eight cases of  <span class="accented">symphonia</span>, five cases of <span class="accented">siphonia</span>, and seven cases of nothing at all. As the word as we have it now is distinctly Greek, the evidence of the Greek versions, while strong negatively, is weak positively. We mean by this that a Greek word put on the margin might easily slip into the text of the Septuagint, and thence into the Palestinian recension - the Massoretic. Moreover, the case against <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is strengthened when we compare the instances in which it occurs with those in which it does not occur. If we looked at the matter <span class="accented">apriori</span>, the cases where a word would most likely be dropped is in a conversational repetition of such a list of instruments. But the best supported case of the occurrence of this word is in the offer made by Nebuchadnezzar, that if even yet they would yield, they would be forgiven. The word in question occurs here in the two texts represented by the Massoretic in the Septuagint and Theodotion. It does not appear in the Peshitta - its place being represented by <span class="accented">tzipbonia</span>, as we said above. On the other hand, the place where we might most readily find a marginal note like <span class="accented">sumphonia</span> is precisely the last occurrence of a frequently recurring list. But, again, the place where we should most certainly expect to find every word of such a list given with scrupulous exaetness, is what purports to be the record of a proclamation. But in Theodotion the word in question is not present in his record of the proclamation. In the seventh verse, where the proclamation is repeated to show the obedience it received, the word <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is absent in the Massoretic text and the versions. Further, next to the record of a proclamation in likelihood for an accurate repetition of all the words of such a list, is, where a case is being founded on this proclamation. This, again, is a case in which <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> does not occur save in the Q'ri. When those who are about to accuse to Nebuchadnezzar the three Hebrews, repeat to him his proclamation, according to the Greek versions they leave out the word before us altogether, according to the K'thib and Peshitta they insert another word altogether. To us the argument seems conclusive that the word in question was not part of the original text of Daniel. We cannot leave this question without adverting to some other aspects of it. The intercourse between the Hellenic peoples and Assyria seems to have been considerable We know from Strabo, 13:2. 3, under the title of Lesbos, that Antimenidas, the brother of the poet Alcaeus, was in the Babylonian army at the time when Nebuchadnezzar was king. Strabo quotes Alcaeus, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f76;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x28;</span> "fought along with the Babylonians as their ally." The Assyrians possessed Cyprus - another source of Hellenic influence. The later Sargonids, Esarhaddon and Asshur-bani-pal, those who had the closest relationship with Babylon, had also the supremacy in Egypt, and now we know from Flinders Petrie and others, in the accounts they have given us of their explorations at Dapine, that there was, before the time of the Babylonian power, a Greek colony of old standing. To meet this contention it is urged that the words in question are much later than the time of Nebuchadnezzar. Certainly we shall admit that the earliest instance of <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is in Aristotle, but the date of the word is not to be limited by its occurrence in Aristotle (Arist., 'Problem.,' 19:23. 2). It occurs in a definition of a <span class="accented">trigon</span> as a triangular psaltery  -  a mode of speech which implies that "psaltery" was already relatively a common designation. We could not define a "trichord" as a piano in which each note was produced by three wires of the same length stretched to the same degree of tension - unless pianos were comparatvely common. That it does not occur earlier is probably due to the word beginning possibly as a localism, and then becoming common in literature. Thus many of the phrases denounced as recent Americanisms are proved by more careful investigation to be old provincialisms that have attained literary rank, or at all events semi-literary rank, in a new country. Hence, even though it were proved that <span class="accented">psanterin</span> is of Greek origin, and that it belongs to the original text of Daniel, which is more than doubtful, it would yet be no great strain to imagine the name and the instrument had passed over to Babylon before the traditional date of Daniel. The case for <span class="accented">sumphonya</span> is even weaker. Even should it be granted to be in the text of Daniel, and further that it is a Greek word, it is not an instrument until at all events a much later date than any one pretends Daniel to have been written. Yet Canon Driver lays the main stress of his argument on the fact that in the passage before us it means an instrument, and in this view he is supported by Mr. Bevan. The whole stress of this statement really depends on a passage in Polybius (Polyb., 26:10), in which it is alleged the word in question means a musical instrument of some sort. The view that the word before us in the passage means a musical instrument can only be maintained on reading the word preceding <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> as <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, not <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, and on the further assumption that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> means a musical instrument, of which there is no proof. It is true that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> means not only the horn  of an animal, but also a musical horn; it is also true that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the diminutive from <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; but it is not to be assumed that all the senses of the original word are retained by the diminutive. A "lance" is the name given both to a medical instrument and to a weapon used by cavalry: it does not follow from this that since "a lancet" is a medical instrument, it is also a military weapon. There is certainly no instance to support the assertion t,,at there ever was such a usage. As naturally it might be used of a drinking-horn. If the reading <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is adopted, the meaning assigned to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> loses even the limited plausibility it had. This view was presented years ago by Dr. Pusey, yet Canon Driver and Professor Bevan have repeated their exploded statements without the faintest attempt at answering the counter-arguments. Were any defender of Daniel to be guilty of anything similar, his ignorance would be sneered at, and his arguments hustled out of court. But there is a further question - Is <span class="accented">siphonia</span> the same word as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>? That the <span class="accented">m</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;</span>) <span class="accented">might</span> disappear and the <span class="accented">upsilon</span> of the Greek <span class="accented">might be</span> represented by <span class="accented">yod</span> in Aramaic, is not impossible, but the fact that, on the one side, there is the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, on the other there is the Eastern Aramaic word <span class="accented">tzgphonia</span>, throws grave doubt on this. With regard to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>, Strack ('Lehrbuch,' p. 15) declares that it is interchanged <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> before <span class="accented">t</span> sounds, and at the end of words; from this we deduce that <span class="accented">tziphonia</span> cannot be derived etymologie-ally from <span class="accented">sumphonya.</span> On the other hand, <span class="accented">siphonya</span> may readily be the product of <span class="accented">tzi-phonia</span>, through the intervention of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and perhaps the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">suph</span>), "a reed." Changes otherwise impossible are rendered possible when they lead to a word with an intelligible sound. There is a verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>, both Chaldee and Hebrew, which, however, does not seem to have any close connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span>, "a reed," or to have any musical meaning. It is used in Biblical Chaldee for the fulfilment of a prophecy (<a href="../../par/daniel/4-30.htm">Daniel 4:30</a>), in Targumic Chaldee "to have an end," "to cease" (Onkelos, <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-20.htm">Leviticus 26:20</a>). The same verb with the same meaning occurs in Syriac (<a href="../../par/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>). This is an additional evidence that <span class="accented">tziphonia is</span> the original form of the word. In transferring the word to Chaldee, they gave it a form intelligible to those who used that tongue. If Syriac were the language in which Daniel was written, then the meaning of the word in that language is important. Castelli - on what authority we know not - gives the meaning of <span class="accented">tzephonya</span>, a word all but identical with that before us, as <span class="accented">tibia</span>, <span class="accented">tuba.</span> Altogether, not only is the genuineness of the word extremely doubtful, but even were it granted that there was a word there, it is not at all certain that it was a word connected with the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. As the assailants of the authenticity of Daniel have laid the great stress of their argument on these words, and, as we have seen, these words afford but dubious evidence, we may consider ourselves to have a right to demand from them to abandon their opposition, or show reason why they do not. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-16.htm">Daniel 3:16</a></div><div class="verse">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we <i>are</i> not careful to answer thee in this matter.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.

But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up</span>. The Septuagint Version differs in several slight points from the Massoretic. "And Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar, O king, we have no need to answer thee in regard to this command, for our God in the heavens is one Lord, whom we fear, who is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and will deliver us out of thy hands, and then it shall be manifest to thee that we neither serve thy gods, nor the golden image which thou hast set up do we worship." In this version we see the sixteenth verse agrees with the Massoretic: in the next verses there are considerable differences. The Septuagint translator seems to have read some part of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">dehal</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">paleheen</span>). We cannot be certain that <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, here, from the fact that the mannerism of the translator expresses itself in a preference for rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Not improbably the original was dual, but the dual had practically disappeared from Hellenistic Greek. There seems a reference to the creed of the Jew (<a href="../../par/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>) and to <a href="../../par/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>; speaking of God as "God of heaven" occurs in the previous chapter, ver. 18, and in ver. 28 Daniel speaks of his God as "in the heaven." However suitable, the first portion is yet to be put aside as an addition. The second portion of this differing clause occurs in Theodotion, and of it we shall shortly speak. There are several other less important differences over which we need not delay. Theodotion has, like the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, and like the Septuagint has the enclitic connection <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, instead of the somewhat abrupt connection of the Massoretic, although the phrase, "in the  heavens," has thus the support of the two. The Peshitta Version has to some extent resulted from the abrupt beginning to the seventeenth verse as it appears in the Massoretic. The Peshitta renders the opening clause, "our Lord is merciful." As in the Septuagint, so in the Peshitta, the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">pith'gam</span>) is taken as meaning "decree;" but <span class="accented">miltha</span> precedes it, which must be rendered, "matter of the decree." Otherwise there is nothing worthy of notice in the Peshitta Version of these verses. Jerome begins the seventeenth verse with "ecce entre," which is not so much a difference of reading from the Massoretic as a difference of rendering from the Authorized. It is clear that the Massoretic punctuation implies something awanting. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> in Biblical Aramaic means "if," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> "it is," that is, "if it be." One feels inclined to think that, suppressed, there was some statement equivalent to "if it be his good pleasure," thus manifesting a readiness to submit to God's will. According to the Massoretic, what follows asserts merely the ability of Jehovah, "our God whom we worship," to deliver his servants from the burning fiery furnace, and even from the hand of the great king himself; but there is no assertion that he will deliver them. The Septuagint Version presents a different aspect, as also Theodotion and the Peshitta. The mental attitude of the Massoretic is very different from the mood of later times. The versions, save Jerome, declare that God wilt deliver them out of the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. If they had received this assurance from God, there was in a sense less of witness-bearing to God than if they had not. The text of the Massoretic is here to be preferred. It is implied also in the meaning of the following verse. Even if God did not deliver them, still their determination is fixed - they will not worship the gods of the king, nor will they worship the golden image he has set up. It sometimes seems as if, even in our own day, we should be the better for the advent of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. There is still a demand that the people of God worship the golden image in the shape of wealth. The ministers of God are, we are told, not to denounce the wrongs of the world, lest the rich be offended. Wealth is not the only form of the golden image which men may be called upon to worship; the breath of popular applause may call them to denounce employers of labour unjustly on penalty of being dismissed or held up to reprobation. It is not the side that is important, but the motive; the cause of the poor may be pleaded as unjustly as that of the rich.

Theodotion differs more from the Massoretic - "the furnace" was to be heated "sevenfold, till it was perfectly heated (<span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fc6;</span>)." The Peshitta, retaining the "one," translates, "one in seven times" - a rendering which seems to have little sense, as the Syriac idiom is the same as that before us. The change of countenance, from that of gratification at seeing a favourite, to that of rage, is a perfectly natural phenomenon, but one possibly even more marked among these races then dominant over the East than among ourselves. It was certainly not unnatural that, heathen as he was, filled with the belief in the mysterious power for good or ill that might be exercised over the empire were any of the gods offended, Nebuchadnezzar should be enraged. The result is that the calmness with which he had previously spoken with the three deserts him, and the form of his face changes, his visage becomes distorted with rage. It may be noted, in passing, that the word here used, <span class="accented">ish'tanni</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), is the only case where the ethpael occurs in Daniel; in all other cases the form is hithpael, with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. Since this is so, one is inclined to credit the peculiarity to scribal change. There is a difference here between the Q'ri and K'thib, the latter reading <span class="accented">ishlannu</span>, which agrees by attraction with <span class="accented">anapolu</span>, "face," which, as in Hebrew, is plural. In order to express his wrath, he orders that the furnace be heated sevenfold hotter than ever before. The word here translated "wont to be" is really part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">hezuh</span>), "to see." Behrmann renders it, "Siebenmal so stark zu heizen als man ihn heizen gesehen hatte" - "commanded it to be heated seven times as hot as ever one had seen it heated." We cannot suppose the Babylonians halt any means of measuring heat of that amount; it is simply a round number, Hitzig remarks on the recurrence of "seven," as if it helped to raise a presumption against the authenticity of the book. The fact that the Babylonians recognized seven planets, and seven gods of the planets, one for each, might as readily be taken as a proof of its authenticity. The probability is that vaguely many times more fuel was placed in the furnace than had ever been done before. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-20.htm">Daniel 3:20</a></div><div class="verse">And he commanded the most mighty men that <i>were</i> in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, <i>and</i> to cast <i>them</i> into the burning fiery furnace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind</span>  <span class="cmt_word">Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> The first clause might more correctly be rendered, "He commanded warriors, warriors of might, in his army." The Greek versions assume that the repetition of <span class="accented">gubereen is</span> equivalent to the superlative; hence the LXX. renders it <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3b9;&#x27;</span>. The Peshitta omits the first <span class="accented">gubreen.</span> On the other hand, Theodotiun omits the clause, "that were in his army." The action of Nebuchadnezzar in this reveals one of the contradictions so often manifested by polytheism. He might be ready to admit that no accumulation of human power could equal Divine power, yet it is obvious that these men of might were chosen for this purpose, in order that, despite Divine power, the royal sentence might be carried out. Such self-contradiction is not peculiar to Nebuchadnezzar nor to Babylon. Many men, professing to be Christians and acknowledging that God sees and knows all things, and that the wrath of God is an infinitely more serious mattter than the contempt or "ill will" of men, yet commit sin secretly - to hide it from God. Hitzig indicates that he thinks these not to have been the ordinary body-guard of the king, but really the best troops in the province where the festival was taking place. It is evident that the troops referred to are not those <span class="accented">tabbaheen</span> of whom Arioch was the commander, otherwise we might have expected them to be mentioned. We know that there were different classes of soldiers in the Assyrian army, with differing kinds of arms and armour. In all probability something similar prevailed in the Babylonian army. It is not impossible that one corps might be specialized as the men of greatest physical strength. These men are employed to bind these three Jews to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-21.htm">Daniel 3:21</a></div><div class="verse">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their <i>other</i> garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace</span>. The LXX. omits the complexity of garments, and translates, "Thus these men were bound, having their sandals, and their hats upon their heads, with their other garments, and were cast into the burning fiery furnace." It would seem that <span class="accented">karbelatheon</span> was either not in the text before the translator or was omitted by him. The latter hypothesis seems a hazardous one to adopt without good ground. We have no reason to accuse the Septuagint translator of this practice. Theodotion also presents signs of omission. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5da;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e1;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5da;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">but simply</span> transliterated, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Under this word Schleusner <span class="accented">says</span>, "Vestis Medica sou Babylonica ad genus pertingens." Aquila, it may be not,d, also transliterates, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>. Theodotion's rendering is, "Then those men were bound in their coats (?), and hats, and hosen, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace." The Peshitta does as Theodotion, and transliterates with the change of a <span class="accented">shin fur a samech</span>, in regard to the first word, and instead of <span class="accented">leboosheen</span>, "garments," has <span class="accented">qoobe'een</span>, which is rendered by Castelli <span class="accented">pileus</span>, or <span class="accented">g</span>,<span class="accented">lea</span>, a "military cap," or a "helmet." He wrongly says that <span class="accented">qoob'o is</span> used to translate <span class="accented">karbelathElon</span>; the word used for that is <span class="accented">nihtho.</span> We need not go into a discussion of the various garments named here. It is to be observed that, by the time of the Septuagint and the original of the version edited and revised by Theodotion, the moaning of the terms was lost - a thing hardly possible on the critical supposition that the date of Daniel is  <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>, if, as seems necessary to suppose from the Greek prologue to Ecclesiasticus, it was already translated into Greek by, at latest,  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>. The point brought out by these garments being mentioned is in order to show the power of God manifested on them. They were all of an inflammable material, therefore emphasis was given to the miracle by this. But, further, it shows they were taken as they were, without opportunity of putting on any specially medicated robes, if such could be imagined (but see <span class="accented">Longman's</span>, August, 1894, reference to Basil Thomson's' South Sea Yarns').

The LXX. translates as follows: "Since the king's command was urgent, and the furnace heated sevenfold more than it had previously been, the men who had been appointed, when they had bound them and brought them forward to the furnace, cast them in. Then the flame which blazed in the furnace came forth and slew the men who had bound those about Azarias, but they themselves were preserved." Theodotion renders, "Since the word of the king was urgent, and the furnace was excessively heated, and these three men fell down bound into the burning fiery furnace, and they fell into the midst of the furnace. and walked about, singing praises to God,  blessing the Lord." There is nothing here, it may be noted, about those that bound the three friends being slain; there is also to be noted the addition, "walking about and singing praises to God and blessing the Lord." The Peshitta also suffers, though to a less degree. The rendering with it is, "Therefore the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace blazed exceedingly, and slew the men who accused Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the midst of the furnace of great fire." Here a marvel is added, not those that threw the Hebrews into the fire were burnt, but their accusers. We must discuss separately the Song of the Three Holy Children. The furnace implied is one filled from above, but having a doorway at the side. The witnesses for the truth of monotheism and of the supreme Godhead of Jehovah were carried to the top of this furnace, and cast in amongst the fuel. We have nothing to do with how the miracle of their preservation was accomplished, we have only to do with the narrative as given. The fact that those who carried them and threw them in were killed gives proof positive of the fierceness of the heat. The fact stated in the twenty-third verse, that they fell into the midst of the furnace, excludes any supposition that they escaped by being sheltered from the fierceness of the heat. Separating the two portions of the apocryphal addition to this chapter, the song of Azarias from the united song of the three, we have a statement that "the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven, and made the midst as it had been a moist whistling wind; so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them." This abundance of detail as to the -method by which the miracle was wrought is evidence of a later time. We shall, however, leave the discussion of the date of this addition till later.

They answered and said unto the king, True, O king</span>. The Greek versions suffer in this verse also from the interpolation of the song. The LXX. renders thus: "And it was when the king heard them singing praises, and stood and saw them living, then was Nebuchadnezzar the king astonished and rose up hastily and said to his friends, Did we not cast three men into the fire bound? and thev said to the king, Truly, O king." Theodotion does not seriously differ from this, "And Nebuchadnezzar heard them singing praises, and marvelled, and rose up in haste, and said to his lords, Did we not cast three men into the midst of the fire bound? and they answered, Truly, O king." The Peshitta rendering is, "Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up trembling, and answered and said to his princes, Were there not three men which we cast into the midst of the furnace of fierce fire and bound? and they answered the king, It is true, O king." As will be seen, the Peshitta varies less from the Massoretic than do the Greek versions. The Vulgar does not merit remark. The action of the king is introduced abruptly in the Massoretic text. This abruptness was probably the occasion of the interpolations made at this point. It may be observed that the interpolations - not-withstanding the efforts of redactors to soften the transition - all add to the difficulty. Theodotion has them immediately walking and praising God. The Septuagint translator, though he omits the walking, implies the praising. We are to unclear-stand the circumstances as of the nature of an <span class="accented">auto-da-fe</span> which Nebuchadnezzar was gracing with his presence, much as Philip II. attended the burning of the heretics in Madrid. The refusal of worship to the god to whom he had erected the golden image was an act not only of heresy, but also of treason of the blackest kind. The word <span class="accented">haddabereen</span>, translated "councillors," is derived by some from the Persian <span class="accented">hamdaver</span> (Behrmann and V. Bohlen). Gesenius would derive it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>, "to do," hence "leaders;" he explains the first syllable of the Hebrew article. The first interpretation is impossible, as is well shown by Bevan (<span class="accented">in loco</span>). The supposition of Gesenius is difficult to maintain, as it involves a passage from one language to another. Moses Stuart regards the noun as derived from the aphel, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> appearing instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>. This is not without parallel examples, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5dc;&#x5d3;</span>. Fuller's parallel of <span class="accented">apalu</span> used along with <span class="accented">pal</span> for "son" in Assyrian, shows a habit of introducing initial syllables to help pronunciation. The Septuagint translator probably read <span class="accented">habereen</span>; hence the rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. In the uncertainty as to the meaning of the word. the reading of the LXX. may be regarded as at least a possible way out of the difficulty. Some further discoveries, either in Babylon or elsewhere, may enable us to decide. The presence along with the king, at this execution, of the high officials of the empire, was fitted to give it all the solemnity of an  "act of faith," but at the same time, their presence gave a signal meaning to <span class="cmt_word">the</span> miracle. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a></div><div class="verse">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</span> The Greek versions do not present much worthy of note, only both insert <span class="accented">molka</span>, "king," instead of the pronoun, and omit "answered." From the fact that ver. 24 ends with <span class="accented">malka</span>, it may have been dropped out of the Masse-retie text. The insertion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> ('<span class="accented">ana</span>), "answered," may be due to the frequent recurrence of this phrase. The Peshitta omits "four," otherwise agreeing with the Massoretic. The phrase," the Son of God," is clearly wrong; the correct translation is, "The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods." Along with the three victims of his superstition was seen a fourth figure, like one of the figures portrayed on his palace walls as belonging to the demi-gods. This is the culmination of the king's astonishment. It was astonishing to see those men loose that had been east into the furnace bound; still more so to see them walking, and none showing signs of having received any hurt; but most awe-inspiring of all is the vision of the fourth figure, like a son of the gods. We must not interpret this on Hebrew lines, as does Mr. Bevan, and comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2</a>. He knows the usage in the Tar-gums is to retain the Hebrew plural in <span class="hebrew">&#x5be;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> when "God" is meant, as in the Peshitta Version of the passage he refers to. As in most heathen mythologies, there were not only gods, but demi-gods, of several different classes. The god Nebuchadnezzar specially worshipped, Silik-Moulou-ki (Marduk), was regarded as the son of Hea. There was a god of fire also, who was associated with these. The suggestion of Dr. Fuller, that here in <span class="accented">bar</span> we have not the word for "son," but rather a truncated form of this god of fire, Iz-bar, is worthy of consideration. It is impossible to say whether Ibis vision of a divine being was vouchsafed to those standing about Nebuchadnezzar as well as to himself. While we ought to guard against ascribing to the Babylonian monarch the idea that this appearance was that of the Second Person of the Christian Trinity, we are ourselves at liberty to maintain this, or to hold that it was an angel who strengthened these servants of God in the furnace. The Septuagint renders <span class="accented">bar-cloheen</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.

Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, came forth of the midst of the</span> fire. The variations of the Septuagint Version here arc inconsiderable. Instead of "spake and said," it renders, "called them by name," and omits the second repetition of the names, and the pleonastic "come hither;" instead of "Most High God," it has"God of gods Most High." Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text; the only differnce is that "spake" is omitted. The Peshitta and Vulgate are in exact accordance with the Massoretic. The distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is "go out" and "come." It is well rendered in our Authorized Verb-ion. only there was no need of "hither" being put in <span class="accented">italics.</span> As above mentioned, this shows the form of the furnace to be not unlike our own - open at the top, but having a door at the side. It was to this side door that the king approached. The fact that Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges Jehovah to be "Most High God" does not imply any recognition of his supreme Divinity, any more than a king of France acknowledged the supremacy of the head of the Holy Roman Empire. when in the credentials of his ambassador the emperor was called <span class="accented">Dominus urbis et orbis.</span> It was simply a matter of what we may call religious etiquette to address gods of the higher class as "god of gods." and "god most high." In <a href="../../par/daniel/2-47.htm">Daniel 2:47</a> Nebuchadnezzar had already declared the God of Daniel to be "God of gods" It is not impossible that to the Babylonians '<span class="accented">illa'a</span> might have the appearance of a proper name. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/3-27.htm">Daniel 3:27</a></div><div class="verse">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellers, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire</span> <span class="cmt_word">had passed on them.</span> The versions present no variation of importance. We can, however, at this point compare the list of officials with that which we find in the beginning of this chapter, in vers. 2 and 3. We find that the word <span class="accented">haddabereen</span> occupies the same place in the list as <span class="accented">gedabreen</span>, translated "treasurer," from which one might be inclined to think that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> had taken the place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span>, not an impossible change. The probability rather is that the word is to be regarded as collective, equivalent to "officials of the court," to save the repetition of the remaining classes Whether or not these officials had seen the companion the three witnesses for the truth had with them in the furnace, they, at all events, were now able to bear testimony to the fact that the three friends had escaped, and "had quenched the violence of the fire" (<a href="../../par/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>). This event was all the more important to the Babylonians as to them fire was a god high in the pantheon<span class="cmt_word">.</span> The God of  Israel was thus manifested as so much greater than Iz-bar, that he could deliver his servants even when in the very element in which Iz-bar had his power. The fact that even their "coats" - whatever these garments were - were not burned, and not even a hair singed, while the cords that had been used to bind them were consumed, emphasizes their deliverance, and shows it to be the work of a higher power, who could discriminate and limit the deliverance. The cords were consumed, but the garments of his servants were preserved even from the smell of fire. The Babylonians had conquered the city of Jehovah, had burned his temple, and had done this through the power of Marduk, so they thought; but here Bel-Marduk had been openly defied by three worshippers of Jehovah. They had been hurled into the very element of Iz-bar, the servant and ally of Marduk, yet fire had been unable to harm them or vindicate the honour of Bel-Marduk. What emphasized this was that the fire that spared the servants of Jehovah slew the votaries of Bel-Marduk, who were eager to show their reverence for Marduk by carrying these Jehovah-worshippers to the furnace. Such a miracle, so wrought before all the high dignitaries of the Babylonian Empire, would go far to take the edge off any taunting reference to the weakness of Jehovah's Godhead as demonstrated by the ruins of Jerusalem. Jehovah had shown himself as the supreme Revealer of secrets when he enabled Daniel to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream. He now manifested himself as Master of the most powerful of elements - fire. The Jews could thus maintain their faith unchallenged.

Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic, as otherwise do the other two versions. We may regard this as the beginning of the royal decree revoking practically that previously promulgated, omitting only the statement of the titles of the monarch. The wording is somewhat peculiar, "Blessed be their God - of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego." It may indicate that some words in the immediate context have been omitted; in other words, that the editor, in quoting the decree, has endeavoured, as far as possible, to condense without changing the words of the document. Bertholdt is mistaken in maintaining that this declaration is that the God of the three Hebrews is worthy of being blessed. All that Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges in this verse is that Jehovah really exists - that he is powerful, and the Hebrews did right to continue in the worship of their national God. We find that the <span class="accented">bar-eloheen</span> of ver. 25 is now regarded by Nebuchadnezzar as an angel, or, as we ought rather to translate it, "messenger." We have no need to import Hebrew ideas into the declaration of the Babylonian monarch. It was quite in accordance with his mythological notions that a great God like the God of the Hebrews might have a messenger, who was his instrument in the deliverance of his servants. The reading of the Massoretes, "changed," is to be preferred to "despised." To one like Nebuchadnezzar, stiff to obstinacy in his opinions, for anything to compel him to change not only his opinions, but more, to alter a decree, was a strange thing, and a thing that he would think worthy of chronicling. At the same time, he might feel it needed a justification. On the other hand, such a one as Nebuchadnezzar would not advertise the fact that any one had "despised" his "word." It is to be observed that Nebuchadnezzar recognizes not only the deliverance as an evidence of the truth of Jehovah's Divinity, but also the willingness with which his servants were ready to offer their bodies to be burnt. The evidence that compelled Nebuchadnezzar to acknowledge the might of Jehovah was the same in essence as that which converted the Roman Empire. Still, we must again repeat Nebuchadnezzar recognized in Jehovah only the God of the Jews, and in the fatthfulness of the three Hebrews only a species of religious patriotism, which he could at once understand and respect without having the slightest belief in monotheism, or even comprehension of such a 'notion.

The Peshitta renders ," to blaspheme." Hitzig  has suggested that the K'thib here is to be preferred to the Q'ri, maintaining that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> means "word," while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> really means "inadvertence." Certainly, if we were sure that the meaning he gives to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span> is correct, and the versions all support it, we would give the preference to it. It has, however, to be borne in mind that, in the notions of heathenism, intentional disrespect was not taken into consideration in regard to the gods. The intention of the worshipper was of very little moment in such a matter; he might even desire to be specially respectful to the deity he worshipped; but if, by inadvertence, he omitted something, or did something which was not according to rule, all the good will and respect in his mind was nothing - the wrath of the insulted deity was poured out in full measure, unless some other deity regarded the action in question as specially honouring to him. It was the external action - the mere form of words - that was the important matter with the polytheist. Idolatry is by its very nature a mental and moral disease; it is as absurd to expect logically concatenated actions from an idol-worshipper in regard to his deities, as to expect the same from a madman in regard to his craze. We must guard against imagining that the decree was against blasphemy as a crime against Jehovah. Primarily it was against words that, by exciting the wrath of Jehovah, might bring down damage on the empire. Nebuchadnezzar was not jealous for the honour of Jehovah, but for the safety of the Babylonian supremacy. The punishment threatened, it may be observed, is the same as that decreed against the wise men because of their failure to tell the dream and its interpretation. In regard to this, in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-5.htm">Daniel 2:5</a> the Septuagint renders the phrase, "Ye shall be made an example of, and your goods shall be escheat to the king's treasury." This change, as we maintained, was due to a difference of reading, not to any objection to the harshness of the phrase. The object of the punishment here was to remove utterly from the earth the wrong-doer and every remembrance of him, so that the offended deity might have no excuse for visiting the kingdom of Babylon with judgments. The reason, "because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort," is not to be stretched too far. All that is asserted is that no other god has been able to deliver his worshippers out of the very realm of the god of fire, and therefore it is to be argued that his power of offence is as great; hence all are to avoid enraging him; but there is no worship enjoined. The Lagid princes, when Jerusalem was in their hands, ordered sacrifices to be offered on their behalf daffy. Nebuchadnezzar does nothing of this sort; his decree is simply negative

The version of Theodotion is considerably interpolated, "Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon, and made them great, and reckoned them worthy to have authority over all the Jews in his kingdom." The first portion agrees with the Massoretic text and with the LXX. in sense; but the last clause is a much later addition. The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic. The exact meaning of <span class="accented">halzlah</span> is "to make glad," "to give rewards to," and therefore is in no conflict with the Massoretic recension of the concluding verse of the preceding chapter, "And Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babyhm." It is to be observed that in the deutero-Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>) there seems to be a reference to this event, "When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." The deliverance from Egypt, and the passage of the Red Sea, and the entrance into Canaan, and the passage of the Jordan, are referred to in the first part of this verse, "When thou passest through the waters, I <span class="accented">will be</span> with thee, and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee." It certainly is but natural to suppose that the deliverance of the three Hebrews from the furnace of Nebuchadnezzar is the historical reference of the latter. <span class="accented">Excursus on the Song of the Three Holy Children.</span> When the student of the apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel passes from the consideration of Susanna and the Elders, and Bel and the Dragon, with their manifold absurdities and manifest tokens of' a Greek origin, to that of the Song of the Three Holy Children, he feels he has come into a different atmosphere. He has not done more than casually perused the whole of the composition called "The Song of the Three Holy Children,"  when he discovers it is in two distinct portions. The whole structure of the two songs indicates a Hebrew origin. The character of the two divisions is quite different. The first is intercessory, and it proceeds from one person; the second is liturgic, and purports to be the joint expression of the feelings of all three. In both there are manifold echoes of earlier psalms. In some cases the phrases are imitated, in other cases adopted with some slight modifications. At the same time, there are in neither portion any obvious tokens of Greek origin, such as may be found in the Story of Susanna, with its play on words which hold only in Greek, or in its Greek views of history as seen in the Story of Bel and the Dragon. When the examples of translation from Hebrew were so numerous as they were by the time that Ben Sira came down to Egypt, and when the translators had by common consent adopted a special style, it cannot be denied that not only could a cento of phrases from the Greek version of the Hebrew Psalter have been formed, but also the style might be imitated, even when the words and sentiments were original. Still, as the aim and ambition of the Jews in Egypt were rather to show the close resemblance there was between the works of the fathers of their race and the sages of Greece, the imitative activity of the Jewish literary <span class="accented">falsarii</span> was directed more to that than to suggest merely a Hebrew original of what they had composed. We have no indubitable instance of psalms being composed in Greek in imitation of the translation of the Psalms of the original Psalter. We have certainly the psalms which go to form the Psalter of Solomon; but these are generally admitted to have been composed in Hebrew, and translated from that into Greek. However, there would still be a dubiety. The only way is to examine this song, or rather these songs, to see whether they contain any traces of being translations from Hebrew originals. As a basis of investigation, we have the two Greek and the Peshitta versions. In a subordinate position we have the Vulgate and the version of Paulus Tellensis. The first thing that one observes, on a casual comparison of the two Greek versions, is that they are much more nearly related, and resemble each other much more closely in regard to these songs, than they do in regard to the rest of the book. The resemblance of the Peshitta to beth is also close, but yet there are points of difference. If we take the introductory sentence, we see considerable variation, greater than occurs elsewhere. The Septuagint begins thus: "Then Azarias stood and prayed thus, and having opened his mouth, confessed to the Lord with his companions in the midst of the fire, made by the Chaldeans to burn exceedingly, and said." Theodotion is simpler - we give the ordinary rendering, "Then Azarias stood up and prayed on this manner, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, said." The Peshitta is, "And Azariah arose and opened his mouth to bless in the midst of the fire, and he opened his mouth and prayed, and said thus." All these versions have the appearance of being a union of two versions of the same tiring. In the Syriac this is most obvious In the Greek versions the evidence of reduplication is afforded by <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f55;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> occurring in the middle of the sentence, instead of naturally at the end, to introduce the speech referred to In the Syriac, which avoids this, it is evidenced even more by the repetition of the verb <span class="accented">pethah</span>, "to open." But this reduplication of versions implies an original of which there were already two readings. A similar phenomenon is presented by the opening verse of the Song of Azariah. As rendered by the LXX. it is, "Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers, and thy Name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore." Theodotion, in the reading preferred by Tischendorf, has <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta has changed the order, "to be exalted and praised is thy Name for ever." The "and" present in the two Greek versions is awanting. In the next verse the Septuagint renders, "Thou art righteous in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are true." Theodotion omits "to us" in the first clause, and has in the last "truth" instead of "true." When we turn to the Peshitta, we find a reason for the resemblance of the second member of the second and fourth clauses. "Righteous art thou in all that thou hast done to us, and all thy works are in truth (<span class="accented">b"</span><span class="accented">qooshtha</span>), and thy ways right, and all thy judgments are faithful (<span class="accented">meheemnin</span>)." In Hebrew, as in Syriac, this contrast could be maintained, but it was more difficult to the Hellenist, who had, perhaps, few words at his command. The following verse in the LXX. runs as follows: "Thou didst judgments of truth in regard to all that thou hast brought upon us, and upon thy holy city, the city of our fathers, because in truth and judgment didst thou all these things because of our sins." The only difference between Theodotion and this is the omission of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "thy." The Peshitta rendering does not evidence much difference from that of the Greek versions, "Because in judgment of truth was what thou didst to us, and in all that thou  hast brought upon us and upon the holy city of our fathers, upon Jerusalem, because in righteousness (<span class="accented">b'c'anootha</span>) didst thou bring upon us all these things." We shall only take the next verse, and shall conclude the verse-by-verse examination of the Song of Azariah. The rendering of the Seventy bears traces of being translated from a Shemitic dialect by one who had not a large vocabulary in Greek. "Because we sinned in all things and transgressed to turn aside from thee, and we sinned in all things, and the commandments of thy Law we obeyed not, neither observed, nor did we according as thou didst command us, in order that it should be well with us." Theodotion is exactly the same. The Peshitta is different, "Because we are debtors of sin (<span class="accented">hoobin dehitin</span>), and wicked before thee, and have removed far from thee, and have done against thy words, and have sinned against thee in all things, and to thy precepts have not hearkened, and did not keep them, and have not done anything which thou commandedst, to be well to us." The sense here is evidently the same, but there has been a difference, if not of text, at least of apprehension of one and the same text. The Syriac could not have been made from the Greek, nor the Greek from the Syriac; they must have had a common source. It would be impossible to say with absolute certainty that this source must have been Hebrew; but the probability is in that direction. Aramaic does not so naturally lend itself to poetry as does Hebrew. Whatever poetry we have by Jewish authors in pre-Christian times which is not in Greek, has been in Hebrew. That being settled, at all events conditionally, the next point is to examine the songs, and see whether they give any evidence in their contents of the background. In the first place, in regard to the Song of Azariah, if we take for granted that it was written in Hebrew, it follows almost necessarily from this that it was composed in Palestine. The next question that requires to be considered is the object of the composition. Was it intended to be placed here? was it written up to this, situation? or was it written for some other purpose, and placed here simply because some one thought it suited? The first thing bearing on this question which we observe is the names which these three Hebrews bear. In the Aramaic part which belongs to the Massoretic Daniel, they are called by their Babylonian names; in this portion their old Hebrew names are revived from the first chapter. That of itself is an indication that this portion has not been written for the place into which it has been put. Further, if this first psalmic fragment had been written for this place, it would have been put in the mouth of Hananiah. The arrangement of the names in Hebrew may have been merely according to the Hebrew alphabet, but instinctively one gives the first-named a certain precedence. Hence in the Peshitta this is called, "]'he prayer of <span class="accented">Hananiah</span> and his companions." For the choice of Azariah instead, there must have been a reason. The simplest reason would seem to be that already there was a sacred hymn extant written by a certain Azariah, and some later editor, seeing this, and knowing that there was an Azariah here, he gave him the credit of it, and as this event was the crisis of his history, declared it to have been composed in reference to this event. Azariah was rather a common name among the Jews; there are eighteen instances of it chronicled in Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible.' It is certainly not so common after the Captivity, yet there was a captain in the Maccabean army called by this name, as above mentioned. When we direct our attention to the song itself, we find what confirms us in our conclusions - that it was not written for this place, but was written as the natural expression of feelings produced by circumstances widely different from those narrated in the chapter before us. If we compare this with the prayer of Daniel, which we find in ch. 9, we see the difference emphasized between circumstances of captives in Babylon and those presupposed by the Song of Azariah. If we turn to the thirteenth and fourteenth verses of the song (vers. 37, 38), "For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins. Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy," It will be noticed that the diminishing of the numbers of the nation, or the restriction of its territory, and the humiliating position it was placed in, is the point of Azariah's complaint. Daniel's sorrow is that they are driven to other countries: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, "in all the countries whither thou hast driven them." In the first case, we have a nation humiliated in their own land; in the second, a nation sent into certain definite countries, and there re-preached with having no country or capital. Again, it is said in the hymn before us, "There is neither prince, nor prophet, nor leader." It is to be noted that the word here is "prince," not "king" (<span class="accented">nazi</span>, not <span class="accented">melek</span>). In the original Hebrew there was probably a play on the words,  <span class="accented">lo-nasi</span> <span class="accented">v'lo-nabi</span>, "neither prince nor prophet." As a matter of fact, in the period of Daniel, prophecy had not ceased, and all through the times of Jewish history it was known that there had been prophets during the time of the Exile. There was, at all events, Ezekiel by the river Chebar, and even if we take the date of the Septuagint for the inauguration of this golden image, and say that it was the eighteenth year of Nebuchaduezzar, Jeremiah was still living and prophesying. As for "princes," they were still in Jerusalem, if we reckon the eighteenth year strictly, but if we regard it as counted according to the Babylonian reckoning, and therefore that Jerusalem had already fallen, there were still "princes," although captives. Moreover, Coniah was still living, the former king, as also was Zedekiah. if we turn to Daniel, he declares the reason of the fall of Jerusalem and of the captivity of the people  - because kings and princes and people had refused to hearken to the word of the Lord as spoken by the prophets. Daniel implies the existence of prophets, princes, and kings. if not absolutely necessarily in the actual present, yet in the immediate past, which, historically genuine or not, fits the setting. In the Song of Azariah there is no reference to a king; there is reference to "a prince" (<span class="accented">nasi</span>, not <span class="accented">sar</span>, which is usually "one of many"). In confirmation of this, there is not only the play on the words, if it is <span class="accented">nasi</span>', but also the fact that the word used in both Greek versions is <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, which is the most common representation of <span class="accented">hast</span> in the Septuagint This was the title of the head of the Sanhedrin, and borne usually by the high priest, it may also be noted that, while "sacrifices" and "offerings" are mentioned as having ceased, there is no mention of "priests." if this song was written at a time when the "prince" was the head of the priests, this omission would be explicable. Taking this as our guide, we should fix the date of the composition of the Song of Azariah at a time when the high priesthood was in abeyance, that is, during the Maccabean struggle, from the time when Epiphanes definitely desecrated the temple till its reconsecration by Judas Maccabaeus. When we look at the state of the temple as implied in this Song of Azariah as compared with the prayer of Daniel, Daniel speaks of the sanctuary being a desolation, and by connection it is implied Jerusalem was a desolation also; but in the song before us there is no <span class="accented">place</span> for sacrifice or offering. The Jews are excluded from the temple, there is no place allowed them there, but the place itself is not a desolation. If, again, we turn to the eighth verse of the Song of Azariah, we find still further evidences of the external circumstances in which it was composed. "And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers <span class="accented">of God</span>, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world." The two Greek versions are here in absolute agreement; the Syriac here, as elsewhere, presents signs of its independent origin, "And thou hast delivered us into the hands of lords of enmity, evil <span class="accented">men</span> who are far from thee, and the habitation of a wicked kingdom, the most miserable in all the earth." The structure of the latter half of this indicates, as it seems to us, that something has been misunderstood in the original document. Some word meaning "unto the power of" has been interpreted as being "dwelling-place," that necessitated the change of "king" to "kingdom" If we then assume the Greek versions to be correct, we find a state of things exactly fitting the period we have suggested above. The mode of speaking of their oppressor - "an unjust king, the most wicked in all the earth" - is quite unlike anything in the Old Testament. When Hezekiah prays to God to be delivered from the power of Sennacherib, although he had reproached the living God, he does not declare that he is wicked. Sennacherib is denounced as proud and cruel, but not as wicked. That would imply a certain amount of godlessness, of which none of the Assyrian monarchs could be accused, and least of all could Nebuchadnezzar. Such a statement is in complete antagonism to the character given to Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel. It was by no means an unnatural description of Ephiphanes. He seems to have had no belief in deities of any kind. His persecution of the Jews had in all likelihood a motive either of policy or of vengeance. Nebuchadnezzar had never attempted to persecute religion in the ordinary sense of the word. The officials of his court he might and did expect to follow him in worship. Another thing to be observed is those that have turned away from God - <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>  <span class="accented">- reheeqeen</span> in the Peshitta. There were certainly many "apostates" at the time of the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, but they were not apostates to the deities of Babylon. The "other gods" the Israelites  were prone to worship were those of the nations around them. This apostasy was not connected with any treasonable submission to the Babylonian princes. So far as we can deduce the politics of the period from the prophecies of Jeremiah, the idolatrous party were patriotic so far as their resistance to Babylon was concerned, though they were always prone to coquet with Egypt. In the case before us, the enemies into whose hands the saints came were "apostates." If, however, we turn to the First Book of Maccabees 1:43, we find that "many also of the Israelites consented to his (Epiphanes') religion, and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath." When we turn to 2 Maccabees, if we may trust it, we find that Jason, having purchased the high priesthood, encouraged Hellenic customs, and even sent money to Tyre for a sacrifice to Melkarth. These gave entrance to Epiphanes, and supported him in his cruelties. We can readily understand how a zealous Jew of the Maccabean time would regard these "apostates" as greater enemies than the heathen followers of Epiphanes. So far as we know, right down from shortly after the return from the Exile on to the period of the domination of the Seleucids, the high priest was <span class="accented">nasi</span>' and head of the people. After the Maccabean period until the Herodian period, the head of the people was the high priest. At the death of Herod the Great, the former relationship was resumed. Even during the reign of Herod there was a prince, in the shape of the king. The mention of a prince, without any mention of a king, excludes all after John Hyrcanus. The assertion that there was no longer a prince, shuts off all the period after Judas Maccabaeus had assumed the high priesthood. We are thus led by another line to fix the date of this Song of Azariah as being the heart of the Maccabean period. The following verse bears its own testimony to the date we have seen reason to fix on above. The Greek versions are at one here, and give the verde, "And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and a reproach to thy servants, and to them that worship thee." The Syriac has a slight difference in the first clause, "It is not for us to open our mouth before thee." This, however, does not affect the main reference of the verse. The meaning of the verse is that the widespread apostasy of the people made them a reproach and a shame to those who served the Lord and feared him elsewhere. The only time coincident with great persecution and consequent apostasy, when there were large communities fearing the Lord who might be scandalized by the apostasy of the Palcstinian Jews, was the Maccabean period, when there was the huge Jewish community of Babylonia, and the equally huge community of Egypt and Cyrene, not to speak of lesser and only lesser communities in Asia Minor. We venture, then, from all these grounds, to assume that this composition is to be dated as belonging to the Maccabean struggle. The liturgical song put in the mouths of all three has noticing to fix its date by. Close examination seems to show that it may have been written for the occasion. A Jew of later times might easily occupy his mind in imagining what would be a likely form a song of praise would take in the mouths of men so situated. Looked at in this light, it on the whole deserves some commendation. If these martyrs did sing, of which there is not a single word in the genuine text of Daniel, it would naturally be a psalm. If they did not take the hundred and thirty-sixth, with its liturgic refrain, then something modelled on it would certainly be their song. Diffuse as this song is, there is a sense of ecstasy in it which suits the mood of martyrs raised by Divine indwelling above pain or fear of death. This seems to have been the original addition, because the twenty-second verse of this portion (ver. 46 in the continuous versification of the Vulgate and Septuagint) suits the state of matters mentioned in ver. 21 of the chapter. In fact, it seems an amplified and exaggerated version of the twenty-second verse. The Song of Azariah, therefore, is probably an insertion of later date than the interpolation of the joint song. Although its insertion is of later date, it not improbably had been composed for some time before its insertion. Those connecting verses - the forty-sixth to the fiftieth, according to the Vulgate - have come to us in three different versions. The version of the LXX. is the longest, "The guards of the king who threw them into the fiery furnace, ceased not causing the furnace to burn (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and when they threw the three once for all into the furnace, and the furnace was very fiery on account of the sevenfold heat: and when they cast them in, those who cast them in were above them; but those from beneath them fed the furnace with naphtha, tow, pitch, and small wood. And the flames of the furnace went up forty-nine cubits, and it passed through and burnt up those of the Chaldeans whom it found about the furnace. And an angel of the Lord descended into the furnace along with Azariah and his companions, and smote the flame of fire out of the furnace, and caused in the midst of the furnace as it were a moist whistling wind; and the fire did not at all touch them, or grieve or trouble them." The  version of Theodotion is shorter by this - that it does not give the relative situation of those who threw the three Hebrews into the furnace, and those who fed it with fuel. The Syriac Version is on the whole in ('loser agreement with Theodotion, but has a different account of the fuel thrown in, and also mentions that the accusers were devoured. The forty-ninth verse, in the Peshitta, differs considerably from the other versions, "Then the angel of the dew descended with Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael into the midst of the furnace of fire." The rest of the passage agrees, as we have said, with Theodotion, but the differences are sufficient to prove a difference of origin. It is to be observed that the three names are given in their Hebrew form, but in a different order from that in which they occur in the first chapter - a fact that gives greater plausibility to the view stated above, that when the Song of the Three Hebrews was originally interpolated, the Song of Azariah was not inserted. When we go on to the song of the three, and look at it somewhat closely, there are what appear to be traces of a process. From the fifty-second verse to the fifty-sixth inclusive in all the versions, we find the Deity addressed. "Blessed art thou," is the beginning of each verse; and the second portion of each verse concludes with, "to be praised and glorified art thou for ever;" or, as the Syriac renders it, "to be praised art thou and to be exalted art thou for ever." The following portion of the song is an address to all living creatures to praise God - each verse beginning," Bless the Lord," and concludes, "Praise and exalt his Name for ever." If this difference may be regarded as intimating a difference of origin, the second is the feebler and more diffuse, and. therefore likely to be the secondary formation. We do not need to go over this with any degree of care The differences mainly consist in transpositions of the successive liturgic summonings. On the whole, the Septuagint is the longer. The phenomena before us have a certain bearing on the question of the date of Daniel. If we are correct in our assumption of the date of the Song of Azariah, then its exclusion from the canonical Daniel - written as it almost certainly was in Palestine, and composed in the Hebrew or Aramaic tongue  - proves the canon to have been fixed at an earlier date, and, by implication, places Daniel at least as far back as that earlier date, and shows that it then was commonly known, and consequently disposes of the Maccabean origin of Daniel. Further, in the passage in 1 Macc. 2:59, where the dying Mattathias exhorts his sons to valour, he refers to the deliverance of the three from the furnace, and calls them by their Hebrew names. This affords a strong presumption that at the time, at all events, when First Maccabees was written, the song of the three was not infrequently added to the canonical Book of Daniel. We can try among ourselves to see how many associate the incident of the fiery furnace with the names of Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, compared with those who recall it, when we mention the Babylonian names Shadrach, Meshech, and Abed-nego. If we could affirm that this gives us the very words used by the dying priest, we could then place the date of this song back as far as  <span class="date">B.C. 200</span>: but not to press this, the First Book of Maccabees must have been written not later than  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>. Then at that rime the Book of Daniel had been so popular and had enjoyed such a vogue that there had already been added to it at least the germ of this song. This addition must have been made so long before that it too had become popular. It will be very difficult to imagine that all these processes could have taken place between  <span class="date">B.C. 168</span> and  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>. <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/2.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 2"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 2" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/4.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 4"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 4" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/4.htm"><title>Daniel 4 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/4.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/4.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/4-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/3.htm" title="Daniel 3">&#9668;</a> Daniel 4 <a href="../daniel/5.htm" title="Daniel 5">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-1.htm">Daniel 4:1</a></div><div class="verse">Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-37.</span> - THE MADNESS OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR. We follow here the division of chapters which we find in our English Version, and as, indeed, in all modern versions. The Aramaic concludes the third chapter with the three verses which are placed in our version at the beginning of the fourth chapter. The arrangement of the Aramaic is followed by the Septuagint, by Theodotion, and by Jerome. The Peshitta and Paulus Tellensis follow the more logical division. Luther divides the chapters logically enough, but carries on the numbering of the verses from the preceding chapter. It is difficult to see anything that can even seem to be a reason for this division. It may indicate a suspicion of these verses at the time the chapters were divided. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1</span> (Aramaic ch. 3:31). <span class="cmt_word">- Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.</span> The Septuagint has a different reading here, "The beginning of the letter of Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples and tongues dwelling in the whole earth: Peace to you be multiplied." In this reading, the first clause is the heading of all that follows, and the document itself begins with, "Peace to you be multiplied." The absence of the opening words from the Syriac Version of the Septuagint by Paulus Tellensis is against its authenticity. It may have been a scribal note which has slipped into the text. Theodotion is an exact rendering of the Massoretic text. The Peshitta Version appears to have followed a recension between that on which the Septuagint Version is founded and the Massoretic text, "Nebuchadnezzar the king <span class="accented">wrote</span> to all nations, peoples, and tongues, Joy be increased to you." The most natural explanation of this uncertainty in the text is that this chapter is a condensation of a longer document. Were the document in question a proclamation of Nebuchadnezzar, his titles would necessarily have followed. These, however, are omitted, and only <span class="accented">malka</span>, "king," is retained. The baldness of this seems to have suggested the variations which we find in the Septuagint and the Peshitta. The recension before us gives the beginning of the letter according to the attesting note of the LXX. In the middle of the document condensation by the simple omission of clauses was seen to be awkward and perhaps impossible, so instead a summary is given in the third person. That we have not found the proclamation itself is not extraordinary from the very fragmentary condition  in which the annals of Nebuchadnezzar have come down to us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-2.htm">Daniel 4:2</a></div><div class="verse">I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2, 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</span> The Greek versions for these two verses are in absolute agreement, hence one is not surprised to find that in the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis, these verses, with that preceding, are marked with an asterisk, which proclaims them not to have been regarded by their translator as a genuine part of the Septuagint, but to have been added from Theodotion. They are in close agreement with the Massoretic text. In these two verses the Peshitta is also at one with the Massoretic text. It is possible that this may have been the actual beginning of the document; on the other hand, it may have been simply the suggestion of some later scribe of how such a proclamation might have begun. The latter is, perhaps, the more probable. At the same time, it vindicates its position by being a not unnatural expression of feelings such as Nebuchadnezzar might well be supposed to have had after such an experience as he had passed through. It may even be that the signs and wonders to which Nebuchadnezzar refers are not merely those of his dream and its fulfilment, but all the signs that had been manifested in his reign.

The Septuagint begins the chapter with this verse, as does the Massoretic text, but further appends a date, "In the eighteenth year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar said, I was at peace in my house, and established upon my throne: I saw a vision, and I was awestruck, and fear fell upon me." Theodotion differs from this and also from the Massoretic text, and renders, "I Nebuchadnezzar was flourishing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) in my house, and was prospering (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>)." The similarity in sound between <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> may have had to do with the rendering. It will be noted that this is further from the Massoretic recension than the Septuagint. The Peshitta repeats the idea of rest, "I Nebuchadnezzar was at peace (<span class="accented">shala</span>) in my house, and was resting (<span class="accented">reeh</span>) in my palace." The Massoretic is supported by the Septuagint, and, therefore, strong. The date in the Septuagint, however, may be questioned. The eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar was that preceding the capture of Jerusalem, which, according to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a>, happened in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. In the twenty-ninth verse of the same chapter we have an account of the carrying away of prisoners by Nebuchadnezzar in his eighteenth year, in a passage omitted from the LXX., in a way that makes it probable that, if this passage be genuine, the one is according to the Jewish, the other according to the Babylonian mode of reckoning. If that is so, the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar would mean the year of the capture of Jerusalem. If this date had, however, been correct, something about the coincidence would have been mentioned. Had this book been written to encourage the Jews in their conflict against Epiphanes, it would have been mentioned that Nebuchadnezzar's madness occurred after he had captured Jerusalem. At the same time, a later scribe would have a tendency to insert such a date, even if no date had been there, or at all events to modify any other date into this. Thus we find in the Septuagint ver. 15 (Massoretic 19, Authorized Version 24) a reference to the capture of Jerusalem. Another cause would tend to make "eighteenth year" liable to occur at this point, it is that the previous chapter in the Septuagint begins with assigning the same date. The change must have been made before the exemplar from which the Septuagint translator made his translation had bern transcribed, as it appears in Paulus Tellensis. Ewald has suggested "the twenty-eighth year" - in many respects a probable suggestion. As Ewald has pointed out, the proclamation would have a date. Even if, as Ewald maintained, it was the work of a later time than the days of Nebuchadnezzar, yet so skilful a writer could not fail to recognize the necessity. The Septuagint Version does not give the beginning of this narrative the form of a proclamation. The attitude of the king is that of rest after the toils of long wars - an attitude that could not be attributed to him when he had not reached the middle of his reign. The conquest of Egypt followed the capture of Jerusalem. The difference between "ten" and "twenty" in Aramaic, as in Hebrew, is comparatively little. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> ('<span class="accented">asar</span>) is "ten," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">asareen</span>) is "twenty." As the "ten" is the final word in the numerical statement, it would be modified <span class="accented">asaratha</span>, whereas the word "twenty" is frequently in similar circumstances unmodified; we should then have 'a<span class="accented">soreen.</span> It may have been even later, but if the real year had been "thirty-eighth," the modification of the words would  require to be greater. Ewald's further consideration, that as "thirty-eighth" would only leave five years till the forty-three years of Nebuchadnezzar were completed, and therefore would not leave space for the seven years of madness, is of less force, as we are not obliged to take "times" as "years" in vers. 16 and 32. The king had received tokens of Divine power in his past history, and had in a sort acknowledged God but still he had not surrendered his pride. The idea that in this there is a reference to Epiphanes seems far-fetched. The only reason assigned by Hitzig and Behrmann is that the Antiochian mob nicknamed him <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>. We have no reason to believe that this was a common nickname, even in Antioch, and there is not very much likelihood of the nickname spreading to Judaea. There is absolutely no evidence that Antiochus ever received the nickname "Epimanes." The passage appealed to is usually Polybius, 26:10, but in that passage there is nothing of the kind said. This portion of Polybius has come down to us only in quotation in Athenaeus' 'Deipnosophistae'  -  a collection of odds and ends, strung together by a dialogue. In this book, twice is this portion of Polybius quoted, and in introducing this quotation in beth cases the author refers to the nickname "Epimanes." In the one case, 5:21 (193), he says generally "Antiochus, surnamed (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) Epiphanes, but called (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">Epimanes</span>, for his deeds." So far as this goes, Antiochus may have been generally nicknamed Epimanes; but it is to be noted that this is not said, and Polybius is not given as the authority. In the other passage the aspect of things is changed. In 10:53 (439) Athenaeus gives the reference to the book of Polybius, and says, speaking of Antiochus, "Polybius calls him Epimanes on account of his deeds." Here Athenaeus says that Polybius himself called Antiochus Epimanes, not that anybody else did so. He does not say that Polybius says that Antiochus "was called Epimanes," but that "Polybius calls him (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;</span>)." He further gives no indication where Polybius says this. As there is no evidence for the nickname, there is no evidence that this incident was invented to suit this non-existent nickname. The picture of Nebuchadnezzar at rest in his palace is as unlike as possible the uneasy restless demeanour of Antiochus, staggering through the streets more or less drunk, joining with any brawlers he might come in contact with. If the writer of Daniel got the story of the madness from the nickname, he would not fail to get an account of the habits of the monarch, which led to the nickname being given. If he intended his picture of Nebuehadnezzar resting in his palace after his victorious career, with all the dignity of an Oriental monarch, to be recognized as a portrait of Antiochus roaming the streets with a set of drunken companions, the author of Daniel must have had singular ideas of portraiture. It would require a madness greater then Nebuchadnezzar's to believe it

This verse is also omitted in the Septuagint. Instead of this verse and those preceding, this verse occurs after the account of the dream, "And when I arose from my couch in the morning, I called Daniel, the ruler of the wise men, and the chief of the interpreters of dreams, and I related to him the dream, and he showed me all the interpretation of it." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The Septuagint arranges differently: instead of deferring the account of the dream till Nebuchadnezzar tells it to Daniel, the account of the dream follows immediately upon the statement of the fact that it had occurred and had troubled the king. In it, as we have seen, there is nothing of the summoning of all the wise men of Babylon in all their various classes. This summoning of the whole college of wise men, astrologers, soothsayers, and Chaldeans, is in obvious contradiction, not only to <a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a>, but also to the ninth verse of the chapter before us. There was no need of summoning the college of augurs until the king had consulted their head. The explanation of these verses and the occasion of their interpolation is not unlike the fact narrated in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>, where Nebuchadnezzar, on account  of his first dream, calls together the wise men - that when he had a dream that troubled him it was natural that Nebuchadnezzar should do as the Septuagint declares he did, summon "Daniel, the ruler of the wise men, and the chief of the interpreters of dreams." One result of which follows, if we discard these verses, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that we get rid, in this passage, of the class of "Chaldeans," and further, of the etymology of "Belteshazzar," both of which have been made objections to the authenticity of Daniel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-9.htm">Daniel 4:9</a></div><div class="verse">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods <i>is</i> in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</span> This verso is also omitted in the Septuagint. Theodotion and the Peshitta both have this passage, but with slight variations from the Massoretic text. Instead of "No secret troubleth [<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, '<span class="accented">anays</span>, 'compel,' <a href="../../par/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8</a>] thee," Thedotion renders, "No secret (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) baffles (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>) thee." The Peshitta renders. "And no secret is hid (<span class="accented">ethcasee</span>) from thee," reading, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5e1;</span>, probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. Behrmann, who translates the word by <span class="accented">verborgen</span>, thinks the choice of the word occasioned by <a href="../../par/ezekiel/28-3.htm">Ezekiel 28:3</a>, "<span class="accented">No</span> secret is hid from thee" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5da;</span>), this last word, he thinks, occasioning the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e0;&#x5e1;</span>; but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>: is used in Aramaic (see <a href="../../par/leviticus/13-6.htm">Leviticus 13:6</a>, "dark" of the spot of leprosy). It seems more probable that there is some mistake in the reading. The Massoretic reading of the last clause seems modelled on the situation in the second chapter, where Nebuchadnezzar demands of the magicians that they not only give the interpretation of the dream, but tell the dream itself. The versions here do not agree with the Massoretic. Theodotion renders, "Hear the vision (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) of the dream which I saw, and tell me its interpretation." The Peshitta has, "In the vision of my dream I was seeing visions of my head, and tell me the interpretation." The Massoretic reading contradicts the situation, and the variety of reading in the two versions confirms the suspicion of this verse induced by its absence from the Septuagint. "Master of the magicians" (<span class="accented">rob-hartum-maya</span>). There is nothing in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-48.htm">Daniel 2:48</a> about the promotion of Daniel over the "magi-clans," but only over the "governors (<span class="accented">signeen</span>) of the wise men (<span class="accented">hakaymeen</span>) of Babylon" This is not to be in itself regarded as a proof of antagonism between these verses and the earlier portion of the, book, as Daniel might have been promoted in the interval. The Peshitta calls Daniel <span class="accented">rab-hahmeen</span>, "chief of the wise men;" Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. It is also to be observed that the writer of these verses does not make Daniel <span class="accented">rab-mag</span>, which so generally was anciently understood to mean "master of the magicians." Avoiding an alluring blunder is often as clear a proof of knowledge as a directly correct statement. "Spirit of the holy gods;" not "<span class="accented">the</span> Spirit," but "<span class="accented">a</span> spirit." The Authorized Version is here correct in translating "gods," not "God," as the adjective is plural; not as Theodotion, who renders, "a holy spirit of God," reading, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-10.htm">Daniel 4:10</a></div><div class="verse">Thus <i>were</i> the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof <i>was</i> great.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great</span>. The Septuagint is different here, "I was sleeping [on my couch], and behold a lofty tree springing out of the earth, and its appearance was great, and there was not another like to it." The words, "on my couch," are marked with an asterisk, denoting that they have been added, probably from Theodotion. There are indications here of a text slightly different from the Massoretic, even in the latter portion of the verse, where the LXX. and the Massoretic text come closest. Instead of <span class="accented">bega</span>,' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>), "in the midst of," the LXX. reading has been <span class="accented">saggeee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>), "great." The last clause is most widely different from the Massoretic text; instead of "and the height thereof was great," we have, "and there was no other like it." It is not easy to imagine how the one reading grew from the other, <span class="accented">roomeh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>), "height," might easily be mistaken for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (demah), if <span class="accented">roomeh</span> were written defectively; but the rest of the clause cannot easily be explained The Massoretic text has a certain redundancy of meaning, which is suspicious. In this verse we are told the tree was "great;" the opening clause of the following says the tree grew; whereas the Septuagint, while asserting its loftiness, asserts also that it was "growing" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). On the whole, we prefer the Septuagint, as it does not proceed to assert further that the tree "grew great." Theodotion, while in the latter portion of the verse agreeing with the Massoretic text, omits the introductory clause. The Pe-shitta is a briefer recension of the Massoretic text, "The vision in my couch was - a tree in the midst of the earth, the height great." The reference here may be, to the sacred tree of the Assyrians, the symbol of life, which is so perpetually introduced into the sculptures of Nineveh, and seen also in some Babylonian cylinders, especially in connection with royal <span class="accented">acts</span> of worship, in Lenormant ('La Magie,' p. 27) we find that a sacred tree - a conifer of some sort  as seen by the sculptures - was supposed to have the quality of breaking the power of the seven <span class="accented">Maskim.</span> Whatever the origin of this belief, it seems to have passed into the faith of Assyria and Babylon, and to have so permeated them that Ezekiel (31) describes Assyria as a mighty cedar. To pass from the empire to its ruler was a specially easy step in regard to an Oriental monarchy, in which the state was the monarch, <span class="accented">in the midst of the earth.</span> This refers to the notion each nation had that their own was the middle point, or <span class="accented">omphalos</span>, of the world. Though <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">gav</span>) meant originally really "back," not "middle," yet it is used of the furnace of fire in the preceding chapter, and the primitive meaning is entirely lost in the Targums. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-11.htm">Daniel 4:11</a></div><div class="verse">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth.</span> This verse is transposed in the Septuagint with the following verse, and is rendered, "And its appearance (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) was great, and its top approached to the heavens, and its breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, equivalent to 'branches') filled (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>) to the clouds all things beneath the heaven and the sun and the moon were, and dwelt in it, and enlightened all the earth." The addition in the last clause is a singular and picturesque one to one standing beneath a spreading tree; sun and moon might pierce with their rays through some thin points in the foliage, but they would seem never to get beyond the widespread branches of the tree, and therefore it would be but a poetical mode of statement to say, "the sun and moon dwelt amid the branches." At the same time, it is not impossible that there was some astronomical legend of the sun and moon and the tree of life. If this proclamation was originally written in cuneiform, there might easily be some difficulty at times in deciphering and fixing in which of a dozen possible senses a given word must be taken. The variation is beyond the region of mere ordinary blundering in Aramaic. On the other hand, it seems too picturesque for the work of a commonplace interpolator. Theodotion in the main agrees with the Massoretic, but instead of "sight thereof," he has "breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) thereof," reading some such word as <span class="accented">path-ootheh</span> instead of <span class="accented">hazotheh.</span> The Peshitta is in close agreement with the received text. To those who, like the Babylonian, believed the earth to he a vast plain, it was not inconceivable that a tree should be so high as to be seen over the whole earth. It is a very suitable symbol of a great world-empire. At the same time, we must remember that the great variation in this verse in the Septuagint makes its authenticity somewhat doubtful. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-12.htm">Daniel 4:12</a></div><div class="verse">The leaves thereof <i>were</i> fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it <i>was</i> meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</span> The Septuagint Version here is widely different: "Its branches were thirty furlongs in extent, and underneath its shadow all beasts of the earth took shelter, and in it the birds of heaven made their nests, and its fruit was much and good, and it supplied all living creatures." As already mentioned, this verse occurs before the one we have just been considering. It differs, like it, more than can be explained by a mistake in reading the Massoretic Aramaic; if it were translated from a cuneiform document, it is easily imaginable in what form the statement might be made. The reading, however, is not an unlikely one in the description of a dream, if we could have imagined the Indian banyan tree to have been known to the authors of this version, we might have understood the tree of the dream to have been like it. Theodotion is at one with the Massoretic text, as also the Peshitta. Whether we take the symbol of a tree used for the Babylonian empire, as drawn from the Babylonian tree of life, or merely devised by the poetic fancy of the monarch, inspired for the time, it must be recognized as very apt. From the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, it stretched from the cataracts of the Nile in all probability into Asia Minor. Over all this empire the monarch maintained the attitude of an earthly providence. It was because government was strong that peaceable men could live. It is useless to carry the similitude into the minutiae of Jephet-ibn-Ali, who maintains that the wild beasts are the nomads of the deserts, and the birds the strangers that came to Nebuchadnezzar from far. In the Aramaic here there are traces of the antiquity in the language: the use of <span class="accented">inbbaya</span>, "fruit," instead of <span class="accented">ibbaya</span>, <span class="accented">is</span> one instance. <span class="accented">Saggeee</span> (with <span class="accented">sin</span>) is a proof that the distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> was still understood, and probably beard. It is remarked by Keil that this word does not really mean "much," but rather "great," "strong." Although it is undeniable that he is correct as to the primitive meaning of the word, it can scarcely mean anything else than "<span class="accented">much"</span> in the present connection. <span class="accented">Mazon</span>, "food," is rare as a Biblical word, but occurs in Genesis as well as Chronicles. Professor Bevan quotes Noldeke in favour of a Mandaean origin for it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-13.htm">Daniel 4:13</a></div><div class="verse">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher</span>  <span class="cmt_word">and an holy one came down from heaven.</span> The Septuagint Version is shorter here, and therefore, other things being equal, is to be preferred, "And I saw in my dream, and an angel was sent in power from heaven." Theodotion is as usual in closer accord with the text of the Massoretic than is the Septuagint; yet he omits "of my head." The Peshitta, yet closer to the Massoretic text, only omits "behold." There is now a change in the vision. The monarch sees "a watcher and a holy one descend." This is rendered rightly by the Septuagint, "an angel." Jephet-ibn-Ali maintains that there are two, and that the watcher is the higher. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">eer</span>), "watcher," occurs only in this chapter in the Bible. In the Book of Enoch the name occurs almost a score of times, and is used to designate the archangels. In the present case the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, (<span class="accented">qaddeesh</span>), "a holy one," is in all likelihood an explanatory addition, the word being unknown before - probably an adaptation of some Assyrian name. On the other hand, in the Book of Enoch every one is supposed to be as well acquainted with the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of Daniel as with the cherubim and ophanim of Ezekiel and the seraphim of Isaiah. Does not this imply that, at the time the Book of Enoch was written, the Book of Daniel was equally well known with those of the two other prophets? The latest conceivable date for Enoch is  <span class="date">B.C. 130</span>, and so late a date never would have been thought of had there not been a necessity to place its date after that at which critics in their wisdom had placed Daniel. The date above mentioned implies that Judas Maccabaeus is unmentioned in a struggle of which he was the crowning hero. Even grant that later date, it is inconceivable that a single generation could have given Daniel such a place of honour as to be regarded as the equal with Isaiah and Ezekiel. In this connection it is to be noticed that, though the <span class="accented">ophunim</span>, "wheels," of Ezekiel are made use of, the <span class="accented">soosim</span>, "horses," of Zechariah do not appear in the later books. Yet they are declared to be spirits. If Daniel were a contemporary of Ezekiel, and his writings had thus had time to sink into the mind of the Jewish people, this phenomenon can be understood.

It is possible that abbey in the Greek was due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">kayn</span>) being read as <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>). The phrase as it stands in the Greek is not unlike <a href="../../par/revelation/14-18.htm">Revelation 14:18</a>, "And another cried with a loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle." It is, therefore, equally possible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>) has been changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b5;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">kayn</span>). The latter part of the verse is more condensed, and therefore, by that, more probable; only the rooting out commanded seems to contradict the fact that it is also commanded to leave "one root of it." Theodotion is in much closer agreement with the Massoretic, save that the <span class="accented">beasts</span>, instead of being warned to depart from beneath the shadow of the tree, are to be shaken (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x1fd6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) from beneath it, as are all the birds from its branches. The Peshitta is an accurate translation of the text of the Massoretes. A peculiarity to be observed in the Aramaic is that the verbs are in the plural, which is retained in Theodotion and the Peshitta. It seems difficult to understand this. Stuart's explanation ? which is practically that of Havernick and Hitzig - that the command is addressed by the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> ('eer) to his retinue, seems highly forced, as there has been no word of a retinue. Keil's and Kliefoth's view, that the plural is the impersonal, does not suit the circumstances. We have a suspicion that the plural is due to a mistake - thinking the watcher and the holy one were separate persons. The Septuagint, however, has the plural, which is all the more extraordinary that <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> is singular. The function assigned here to the angels must be observed. Here, as in the parables of our Lord, the angels are the instruments by whom the decrees of providence are executed. In our days angels are not believed in. It is possible that materialism has much of its advantage over us, in that we do not recognize the existence and activity of angelic forces among the agencies of nature and providence. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-15.htm">Daniel 4:15</a></div><div class="verse">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and <i>let</i> his portion <i>be</i> with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth</span>. Again the Septuagint differs considerably from the received text, "And thus he said, Leave one root of it in the earth, in order that it may with the beasts of the earth browse in the mountains on grass like an ox." As the reading is the briefer, it is on the whole to be preferred, the more so that the belt of iron and brass is got rid cf. The Septuagint assumes that the work of demolishing the tree had gone on to some extent, and then the watcher intervenes to bring forward this limitation to the completeness of the destruction at first enjoined. Theodotion is in  agreement with the Massoretic text, as also the Peshitta. Moses Stuart thinks the belt of iron and brass is represented as being put round the stump of the tree in order to prevent it cracking, and so rotting, in this following yon Langerke. Keil, with more justice, thinks that this is a transition from the symbol to the person symbolized; in this view he agrees with Hengstenberg, Kliefoth, Zockler, Behrmann, Hitzig, Ewald, Kranichfeld, and others. There is a further division of opinion <span class="cmt_word">as</span> to whether it symbolizes the mental darkness Nebuchadnezzar will be under, or the limitation of his kingdom, or the fact that, as a maniac, he will be bound with fetters. The fact that, while commentators have devoted so much time to this, there is no reference to it in the interpretation, confirms us in our suspicion of the whole clause. The transition to the person, if barely doubtful in regard to the belt of iron and brass, is obvious in the remaining clauses in this verse. Every tree is wet with the dew of heaven - that would indicate neither degradation nor hardship; and the browsing with the boasts is impossible to a tree. The transition from thing to person is in perfect accordance with what every one has experienced in dreams. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-16.htm">Daniel 4:16</a></div><div class="verse">Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">his heart be changed from</span> <span class="cmt_word">man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass ever him.</span> The Septuagint rendering seems to be taken from the previous verse, "And let his body be changed by the dew of heaven, and let him be pastured with them seven years." It seems difficult to imagine, either, on the one hand, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">libebayh</span>) changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">pi</span>g<span class="accented">erah</span>), the word by which Paulus Tellensis translates <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, though it suggests "carcase," or into <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nid nayh</span>), the word used in <a href="../../par/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a>; or, on the other, that either of these should be read <span class="accented">lebab.</span> At the same time, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> are not unlike in old inscriptions, nor <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span> unlike <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span>; any indistinctness in the third letter might easily lead to a mistake. It is not impossible that some of the words in the latter part of the previous verse have been modified from some word meaning "body." It is equally difficult to guess what word has been read by the Septuagint translator instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yah-lephoon</span>), "let them pass over." The greater brevity of the Septuagint is in its favour. Theodotion is, as usual, in closer agreement with the Massoretic; he renders <span class="accented">min-anaosha</span> or <span class="accented">anosha</span>' for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "from men" - a possible translation, and one favoured by some recent commentators. The Peshitta agrees quite with the received text. According to the received text, the main change was mental - the human heart is removed, and the heart of a beast given. On the other hand, in the twenty-third verse, in which we have the fulfilment of the dream, the change is mainly physical, and it is to be observed that the change is produced by "the dew of heaven." <span class="accented">Seven times.</span> The word '<span class="accented">iddanun</span>, "times," is a matter of some difficulty; it means really "seasons" or "points" of time, as in <a href="../../par/ecclesiastes/3-2.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:2</a>, Targum, and <a href="../../par/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>, Targum Onkelos, "It came to pass at this time." It is purely arbitrary to fix the meaning here as "years," as is done by the Septuagint and by many commentators. Theodotiom keeps the indefinite<span class="accented">ness</span> of the original by rendering the word here <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>. The Peshitta transfers the word. It may be" months" as suggested by Lenormant; it maybe "seasons," in our usual sense of the word. Rendel Harris's 'Biblical Monuments,' p. 73, says, "Summer and winter are the only seasons counted in Babylonia;" if so, seven '<span class="accented">iddaneen</span> would be nearly four years. From the fact that exposure to weather is the point of importance, Mr. Harris's view is not impossible; but pathological reasons suggest "months" (see Excursus at the end of chapter). <span class="accented">Seven</span>, with the Babylonians, as with most other Semites, is a round number of sacred import, and therefore may not be pressed. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a></div><div class="verse">This matter <i>is</i> by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy odes: to the intent that the living may know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men</span>. In this verse the difference between the Septuagint text - we mean the text behind that version - and that of the Massoretes is great. It is as follows: "Until he know the Lord of heaven to have power over all things which are in heaven and on the earth, and such things as he willeth to do, he doeth." This, as may be observed, is very much briefer than the Massoretic, and hence, to a certain extent, to be preferred. It is, however, difficult to imagine the genesis of the one from the other, as they have only two words in common in a similar connection, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d8;</span> (<span class="accented">shaleet</span>) and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">yinedeoon</span>)' If we start with the supposition that the Massoretic text is the primary, we have a difficulty in seeing what reason induced this peculiar form of condensation. Had it been to get rid of <span class="accented">the decree of the watchers</span>, <span class="accented">and the demand of the holy ones</span>, that clause might have been simply omitted, and the sense would have given no sign of anything having been omitted. If, again, we start with the Septuagint text as our basis, it is difficult to understand what led to the insertion of "the decree of the watchers" and "the demand of the holy ones." Of  course, the period of the Persian domination and that of the early Greek supremacy was one in which the angelic hierarchy was enormously increased and made vastly more complex than it had been before. Further, it is to be noted that "the watchers," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">ereen</span>), are here distinguished absolutely from "the holy ones," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">gad-deesbeen</span>), whereas in ver. 10 (13) "the watchers" and "the holy ones" are identified. This distinction is made in later Jewish commentators, and therefore its. presence here, fin contradistinction to ver. 13, is proof of a relatively late origin for this clause. Zockler would avoid this by asserting a parallelism of members in this sentence; but, in the first place, this is not verse, but prose, and therefore parallelism need not be expected. Further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "a decree" given by a person in authority, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>) is "a petition" presented to one in authority. So far from the two being identified in the verse before us, the watchers and the holy ones are as absolutely contrasted as they can be. Bevan simply appeals to ver. 10 (13) to prove their identity - sense has no influence with him. When we turn to Theodotion, we find that, in his practical identity with the Massoretic text, he has preserved the contrast between "<span class="accented">decree"</span> and "<span class="accented">petition</span>," the former word being represented by <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, and the second by <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. These two words represent fairly well the distinction between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">gezayrath</span>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">sh'alayth</span>). It is probable that <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is used instead of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> in order to show that <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c1;</span> is to be regarded as genitive plural. The Peshitta follows the Massoretic, but less closely. It has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, "watcher," in the singular. This clause in the Syriac should be rendered, "according to the decrees of the watcher is this order, and according to the word of the holy one is the request;" it retains the distinction in question much as it is in the received text, but with a distinct difference of meaning in regard to the ether words of the clause. So, too, Jerome in the Vulgate translates, "In sententia vigilum decretum eat et sermo sanctorum et petitio," thus maintaining, in all the confusion there is in this rendering, the distinction we have referred to. In the final clause, the Vulgate is further astray from the Massoretic. translating, <span class="accented">super eum.</span> The theology of this passage is singular, so singular that, were it not for the omission of the passage from the Septuagint. and its contradiction of ver. 13, we might be inclined to think it must be genuine. (For a similar statement, see <a href="../../par/galatians/3-19.htm">Galatians 3:19</a>, "The Law...  was ordained by angels;" <a href="../../par/hebrews/2-2.htm">Hebrews 2:2</a>, "If the word spoken by angels was steadfast.") The view seems to be that the Almighty had a council of angels, and before them was every question discussed ere it was decreed. In short, that there was a heavenly sanhedrin, corresponding to that on earth  - an idea which was developed by the Talmudists. It appears in Enoch, not vet fully developed. In Enoch 12. certain of the watchers are denounced as having defiled themselves with women; in ch. 20. we have the name of the holy angels who watch, and in this chapter we have the different provinces assigned to each of them. Six are enumerated. They have thus no collective function. In the portion of Enoch preserved in Syncellus, men are represented as calling to the heavens, and addressing them; and the four angels, Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel, give answer by looking down upon the earth, and they see the blood that is being shed by violence. Then follows the statement, "And the four archangels came before the Lord, and said." They may be here said to act in a collective capacity, but they have no deliberative function, still less have they any power to decree. The interpolated verse before us thus represents an angelo-logy more developed than that of the date of the Book of Enoch. <span class="accented">And setteth up over it the basest of men.</span> This phrase <span class="accented">suggests</span> the "vile person," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">nibezeh</span>), of <a href="../../par/daniel/11-21.htm">Daniel 11:21</a>, who is probably Epiphanes - the reference in this interpolated verse is not unlikely the same. The Syriac form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> in the K'thib has to be observed. One peculiarity which points to interpolation is the Hebrew plural here used, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">anasheem</span>). Were it not that our <span class="accented">suspicions</span> of this verse are deepened by examination of it, we should be inclined to see a reference to that usurpation of Nebuchadnezzar's throne, which Lenormant thinks is implied in the title Neriglissar gives to his father. There seems to be a reference to something like this in ver. 24 of this chapter, according to the version of the LXX.

On the other hand, the verse in the Septuagint which occupies this place is totally different from anything in the Massoretic text: "Before me was it cut down in one day, and its destruction was in one hour of the day, and its branches were given to every wind, and it was driven out and dragged forth, and it ate the grass of the earth, and  it was delivered to a guard, and in brazen fetters and shackles was it bound with them. I marvelled exceedingly at these things, and the sleep departed from mine eyes." The first thing that strikes one with this is the fact that it is a translation from Aramaic. The clause, "in brazen fetters and shackles was it bound with them," seems nearly demonstrative of this. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> is not a sentence which any one would naturally write in Greek, but the sentence is natural if the translator followed his Aramaic original slavishly. If, then, this is correct, the hypothesis of a <span class="accented">falsarius</span> is reduced to that of an Aramaic <span class="accented">falsarius</span>, who intruded this verse into the Aramaic original which was conveyed down to Egypt. On the other hand, the verse in the Septuagint completes the narrative which the Massoretic text leaves unfinished. This may be used. as an argument against the authenticity of this version, as the need of completion may have suggested the mode in which the need was to be supplied. But it is also to be noted that there is present the same mixture of sign and thing signified, which, natural in a dream, is so unnatural in ordinary narration, that the <span class="accented">falsarius</span> who had observed the incompleteness of the Massoretic text, and had the necessary skill to supply the want, would not have increased the confusion, already manifest enough. When we turn to Theodotion, we see symptoms of trouble, "This is the vision which I Nebuchadnezzar the king had, and thou, Beltasar, tell the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom were able to show me its interpretation; but thou, Daniel, art able, because a holy spirit of God is in thee." The introduction of the Jewish name Daniel in the midst of a speech in which he is always elsewhere addressed by his Bahylonian name, is suspicious. The repetition, in this as in the Masoretic, of the original incongruity that Daniel, the head of the court magicians, is only summoned after the other magicians have proved unable to solve the mystery of this dream, is to be noted. The Peshitta here partly follows the same text as that followed by Theodotion, and partly that of the Massoretes. Like Theodotion, "Daniel" is inserted, but, following the basis of the Massoretic text in opposition to Theodotion, it has "a spirit of the holy gods." There seems no possibility of imagining the LXX. reading to have developed from the Massoretic, or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> If there were any proof of Dr. C. H. H. Wright's hypothesis, that our present Daniel was a condensation of a larger work, it might be supposed that the Massoretic represented one condensation, and the LXX. another. The Septuagint at this point inserts, "And having risen early in the morning,. I summoned Daniel, the ruler of the wise men and chief of the interpreters, and related to him the dream, and he showed all the interpretation of it." In <a href="../../par/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. we have two accounts of Pharaoh's dream, first in connection with his actual dreaming, and next in his narrating to Joseph his experience. If the original tract - from the union of several of which we imagine our book has been compiled - from which this chapter is condensed contained, like <a href="../../par/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, two accounts of Nebuchadnezzar's vision, and the Egyptian recension followed one condensation of this tract, and the Palestinian another, the phenomena are explicable without the idea of a vague gratuitous variation, such as that of which, on the traditional view, the writer of the Septuagint has been guilty. On the ground that the Massoretic text may represent also a true text of Daniel, another fragment of the original document, we may examine it a little more closely. The king declares the dream to Daniel in a way that indicates a certain attestation of the accuracy of the report of what he had seen. "This is the dream which I Nebuchadnezzar the king saw." Then follows the command to declare the interpretation, "You are master of magicians. I have duly brought before you an accredited dream which I have had, fulfil now your office, interpret to me my dream." This much is natural. What follows is an obvious interpolation. It contradicts what has preceded, which, by implication, asserts Daniel's duty to interpret, and therefore the probability that not last, but first, would Daniel have been appealed to. It contradicts also what follows, which is a commendation of Daniel's powers, which, as known to the king, ought to have led him at once to summon him, as the Septuagint says Nebuchadnezzar did. The commendation of Daniel appears an addition to get over the difficulty, but, like many other attempts of the same kind, it fails, and really adds to the confusion.

There are traces in it of doublet; the rendering of the LXX. is, "And Daniel greatly marvelled, and suspicions disturbed him, and he was terrified, trembling having taken hold of him, and his visage was changed, having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, having been amazed one <span class="cmt_word"></span> hour, he answered me in a meek voice." Theodotion and the Peshitta are at one with the Massoretic text here. It is to be noted here that the word <span class="accented">sha'a</span>, translated "hour," has no such definite meaning; Gesenius gives, "a moment of time," in which he is followed by Bevan, Keil, and Stuart. Ewald translates, <span class="accented">eine Stunde</span>, and with him agree Hitzig, Kranichfeld, Zockler. Both the Greek versions have <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, but we must bear in mind that <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> had not the definite meaning which we attach to "hour." Jerome renders <span class="accented">hera.</span> The Septuagint adds, as we have seen, somewhat grotesquely, "having moved (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>) his head, he was astonished for one hour." This seems a case of "doublet," that phenomenon so frequent in the Septuagint. The Septuagint rendering, "And (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) Daniel was greatly astonished, and suspicions troubled him, and, trembling having seized him, he was afraid," suggests that it is not impossible that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;</span>, "greatly," had been read instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span>, "an hour;" but the rest is not so easily explicable. There is one case of Syriasm here in the vocalization of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> This clause is absent from both the Greek versions, though present in the Peshitta and Vulgate. As it stands, on the one hand, it is a departure from the epistolary style, or perhaps rather the proclamative style of the earlier portion of the chapter. On the other hand, if we think this clause an interpolation, we cannot fail to note that the kindly courtesy and consideration ascribed by the interpolator to Nebuchadnezzar is utterly unlike the character of Epiphanes as manifested to the Jews. Nebuchadnezzar saw that Daniel was filled with sorrow and apprehension at the meaning he saw in the vision, and endeavours to reassure and encourage him. If the conduct of Nebuchadnezzar is unlike that which a Jew of  <span class="date">B.C. 170</span> would have ascribed to him were it his intention to present in him Epiphanes under a disguise, still more unlike is the conduct of Daniel to that which certainly would have been ascribed to him had the author intend(,d to represent him as a model of the pious Jew in a heathen court - in the court of Epi-phanes. Would Mattathias have remained astonished and speechless in the presence of Epiphanes, had it been revealed to him that Epiphanes was to be driven out to the wilds a madman? If, then, it is an interpolation, it is an early one - earlier than the Maccabean struggle. But if the interpolation be early, the book interpolated must be yet earlier. <span class="cmt_word">Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies</span>. The Septuagint maintains the epistolary character of this narrative here, "And Baltasar answered me with a meek voice, This dream be to those that hate thee, and let the interpretation thereof come upon thine enemies." Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate are at one with the ordinary text. The feelings of Daniel towards Nebuchadnezzar seem to have been those of the highest personal loyalty, and thus in the widest contrast from the feelings that any Jew of the time of the Maccabees would have towards Epiphanes. He, Daniel, in his love for the grand impulsive despot, would have the enemies and haters of his monarch swept forth to wander as maniacs, rather than that he should so suffer. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-20.htm">Daniel 4:20</a></div><div class="verse">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, an the sight thereof to all the earth; whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation: it is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth</span>. The Septuagint Version here differs very considerably in wording from the above, but not in sense, "Thou, O king, art this tree planted in the earth, the appearance of which was great, and all the birds of the heaven made their nests in it: the strength of the earth and of the nations, and of all tongues to the ends of the earth, and all the provinces (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) serve thee. And that tree was exalted and neared the heaven, and its breadth (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) touched the clouds. Thou, O king, wast exalted above all men that are upon the face of the whole earth, and thine heart has been [literally, 'was'] lifted up with pride and strength over those things which pertain to the Holy One and his angels, and thy works are manifest, because thou hast laid waste the house of the living God on account of the sins of the consecrated people." The latter portion of this contains plain evidence of interpolation. Had there been anything of that sort in the original Daniel, it would not have disappeared from the Massoretic text. This addition reveals the mental attitude of the Jews of the Maccabean period to foreign oppressors. The fact that the whole atmosphere of the primitive Daniel differs so much from this is an indirect evidence of its genuineness. If one looks at the Septuagint rendering of these three verses, there seem evidences of an early origin. The first verse is clearly an instance in which  the text behind the Septuagint is superior to that of the Massoretic; the latter is obviously filled out from ver. 11. The statement of Nebuchadnezzar's greatness in ver. 22 (14 Septuagint, 18 Massoretic) may be somewhat the result of paraphrase. The fifteenth verse, according to the LXX., which is paralleled by Tischeudorf with ver. 19 of the Massoretic, is really another version of the preceding verses, probably slightly modified to give the resulting text the appearance of being continuous. Theodotion bears a very close resemblance to the Massoretic text, only he has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "breadth," instead of <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Peshitta differs but little, though still a little, from the Massoretic text. Instead of rendering, "meat for all," it has, "for all flesh." According to both recensions of the text, Daniel repeats, either in substance or with verbal exactness, the description Nebuchadnezzar had himself given of the tree of his vision, but applies it to the monarch. To us the terms of the description of Nebuchadnezzar's power are exaggerated; but we must bear in mind that the manners of an Oriental court are different from those of Western nations. It is not unlike the boastful language of Nebuchadnezzar in the Standard Inscription. The monarch's dominion was vast, but it had been given him, and that he did not recognize, and hence the judgment that came upon him.

This in the beginning agrees with the text behind the Septuagint Version of ver. 14 (7 LXX., 11 Massoretic). In that verse, instead of the elaborate process of cutting off branches and shaking off leaves, the Septuagint had simply, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>. This confirms us in our preference of the Septuagint there. In the present instance, the Septuagint is briefer than the Massoretic text; it varies in some points, which may indicate the hand of a redactor, "And the vision which thou sawest, that an angel was sent in strength, and commanded to root the tree up and to cut it down, the judgment of God shall come upon thee." Here, again, there is nothing of "the watcher and the holy one," nothing of the belt of "iron and brass," nor of the "tree having its portion with the beasts of the field," nor that it was to be "wet with the dew of heaven." Some of these features are mentioned in the account of the vision, but are not repeated now. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta carries the repetition yet further, and inserts, "And his heart shall be changed from the heart of 't man, and the heart of a beast shall be given him." In this the process already begun in the text of the Massoretes is carried a little further. The Vulgate agrees with the received text. Daniel rapidly notifies the principal features in the king's dream, before he proceeds to explain it. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-24.htm">Daniel 4:24</a></div><div class="verse">This <i>is</i> the interpretation, O king, and this <i>is</i> the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High, which is come upon my lord the king</span>. The passage in the Seventy which is parallel with this is partly in the last clause of the previous verse and partly in the verse that occupies a similar place to this in the Septuagint text, "The judgments of the great God shall come upon thee, and the Most High and his angels assail thee (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f72;</span>)." The change of tense here indicates that the second clause is an alternative rendering, brought into the text from the margin. In this marginal note <span class="accented">meta</span> has been taken as "assail," and <span class="accented">malka</span>, "O king," has been, by transposition of the two final letters, read <span class="accented">mela'k</span>, "angel." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The respectful tone in which Daniel addresses Nebuchadnezzar in the received text is to be observed; it is utterly alien to the boastful tone Judaism was afterwards accustomed to impute to its old saints. That there is no reference to the watchers or to their decree in this is imputed to Daniel's recognition of its true source; but in the Septuagint there is nothing equivalent to the statement in ver. 17. The fact that it is omitted here confirms the suspicion against it which we expressed in regard to the earlier verse. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-25.htm">Daniel 4:25</a></div><div class="verse">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will</span>. The Septuagint Version is here much briefer, and in that better, "And they shall put thee in guard, and send thee into a desert place." The Massoretic text, although it agrees with that from which Theodotion's Version, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate have been translated, is pleonastic. The Vulgate drops the causative element, and simply says, "Thou shalt eat grass like the ox, and thou shalt be wet with the dew of heaven." The Peshitta, while translating <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> by the aphel of '<span class="accented">acal</span> - that is to say, making the meaning causative - renders  <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> by the passive, <span class="accented">titztaba</span>; similarly Theodotion renders it. If we are to take the words of Daniel strictly, even in the Massoretic, much more if we take the Septuagint, text, he seems to have understood the dream to point, not to lycanthropy, but to an overthrow at the hands of his enemies, when they would compel him to eat grass in his distress, and, by depriving him of every shelter, force him to be wet with the dew of heaven. There is nothing to indicate that the compulsion should work within, and that by these inner scourges the messengers of the Most High would drive Nebuchadnezzar forth to the fields. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-26.htm">Daniel 4:26</a></div><div class="verse">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; thy kingdom shall be. sure unto thee, after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule.</span> The Septuagint Version here is different, and not so good as the received text, "And (as for) the root of the tree which was left and not rooted out, the place of thy throne shall be preserved to thee to a season and an hour; behold, for thee they are prepared, and they shall bring judgment upon thee. The Lord liveth in heaven, and his power is in all the earth." The last clause here is plainly a paraphrase of "the heavens do rule." "A season and an hour" is a doublet, and since it is to be observed that the phrase, "after that thou shalt have known," is omitted, we may deduce that <span class="accented">thindda</span>, "thou shalt know," is, by transposition of letters, read <span class="accented">l'iddan.</span> Theodotion, who is usually slavish in his following of the Aramaic construction, renders here, "And because they said, Suffer the stump (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span>) of the roots of the tree." This suggests that in the text before Theodotion <span class="accented">mere</span> is omitted from <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">l'mishbaq</span>), and it was read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5d1;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">leishbaqoo</span>), meaning, according to the Mandaitic form of the verb, "they shall leave" - a form in accordance with the previous construction, then further altered to the second person plural. The end of the verse is also slightly different, "Until thou shalt know the heavenly power," reading here <span class="accented">shooltan dee shemya</span> instead of <span class="accented">shaltan shemya.</span> The Peshitta renders, "till thou shalt know that power is from the heaven (<span class="accented">min shemya</span>)." Mr. Bevan remarks on this usage of "heavens" for "God," which he compares with the Mishna and with the New Testament. He does not observe that the difficulty all the translators have with the phrase is a proof that, when the versions were made, it was even then not a common usage; hence that its introduction here was not due to the influence of the Mishnaic Hebrew stretching back, but was owing rather to the peculiar circumstances of Daniel. Professor Bevan's reference to the New Testament is mistaken. In no case in the New Testament is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> used for "God." Even in the Greek Apocrypha is no usage precisely equivalent. Daniel, by using the phrase he did, put himself on the same level as the heathen king - pride against the gods (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>), and of this, by implication, is Nebuchadnezzar here accused. Certainly the words of his inscriptions do not indicate anything of this sort. In fact, many of the phrases in the prayer to Marduk in the India House Inscription indicate reverent humility almost Christian. Still, these phrases might be due, to some extent, to political custom. The relation of a polytheist to his gods is a psychological enigma to a civilized monotheist. On the one hand, he recognizes his dependence on the god; on the other, he considers the god honoured by his worship, and therefore owing him certain duties in return. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a></div><div class="verse">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity</span>. The Septuagint Version differs in this case somewhat considerably. It connects itself with the preceding verse, "Entreat him on account of thy sins, and to purify' all thine unrighteousness in almsgiving, in order that he may give thee humility, and many days on the throne of thy kingdom, and that thou be not destroyed." This version is paraphrastic and inferior as a whole to the text of the Massoretes, but at the same time, there must have been a different text to make such a rendering possible. Theodotion is more in accordance with the Massoretic text, but also has resemblances to the Septuagint here, "Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and atone for thy sins by almsgiving, and for thine unrighteousness by mercies to the poor (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), perchance (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) God will be long-suffering to thy transgression." The last clause may be due to reading '<span class="accented">elaha</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d0;</span>) for '<span class="accented">archu</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d0;</span>), in which case the last clause would read, "God may be for thy tranquillity." In this case Theodotion's rendering is a natural paraphrase. The Peshitta is in agreement with the received text, save that <span class="accented">malka</span>, "king," is left out, possibly from its resemblance to <span class="accented">milki</span>, "my counsel." The Vulgate rendering is, "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be pleasing unto thee, redeem thy sins by almsgiving, and thine iniquities by mercies to the poor; perchance he will forgive (<span class="accented">ignoscat</span>) thy sins." This follows Theodotion so far in the last clause, but not wholly,  It is to be noticed that all the versions translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">tzid'qah</span>) "<span class="accented">almsgiving"</span> - a late meaning, and one not present in the Massoretic here. It can only be forced upon,this passage by giving <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">peraq</span>) a meaning it never has, as Professor Bevan and Keil show it to mean "to break," and as breaking a yoke meant "setting free," it thus meant redeeming a person; but in the sense of paying a ransom for sins, it never is used, even in the Targums. There is, therefore, a wide difference between the moral standpoint of the writer of Daniel and that of his translators - so wide that the writer of Daniel does not see the possibility of his words being twisted to this meaning. In Ecclesiasticus almsgiving is made equivalent to righteousness. The writer of Daniel is on a different moral plane from Ben Sira. But more, Daniel must have been translated into Greek before Ecclesiasticus, as the whole canon was translated when the grandson of Ben Sira had come down to Egypt, and this at the latest was  <span class="date">B.C. 135</span>; on the critical hypothesis, not a score of years separate the text of Daniel from the translation. The courteous beginning of Daniel's speech is to be observed; he is anxious to win the king to repentance. Compare the stern, unrelenting demeanour of Elijah to Ahab, and of Elisha to Jehoram. If we compare this with the way the Jews of Talmudic times regard the memory of Titus, the Roman captor of Jerusalem, we see we are in a totally different atmosphere from that in which the Jewish <span class="accented">folsarius</span> of any period of Jewish history could have lived. A grand impulsive character like Nebuchadnezzar could not but at once allure and awe the young Jew, but a zealous Jew would have regarded it as derogatory to imagine this of a prophet of the Lord, and so we see the Septuagint translator drops the courteous words with which Daniel introduces his <span class="accented">advice.</span> Daniel looked upon the fact that the warning had been given as an evidence that there might be a place for repentance. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-28.htm">Daniel 4:28</a></div><div class="verse">All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 28, 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this came upon the King Nebuchadnezzar. At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon</span>. The Septuagint here has the look of a paraphrase. In continuation of the preceding verse, "Attend (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) to these words, for my word is certain, and thy time is full. And at the end of this word, Nebuchadnezzar, when he heard the interpretation of the vision, kept these words in his heart" (compare with this the phrase in <a href="../../par/luke/2-19.htm">Luke 2:19</a>). "And after twelve months the king walked upon the walls of the city, and went about its towers, and answered and said." The variations appear to be due to a desire to expand and explain. It seemed to the translator more natural that, after a survey of the walls and towers of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar should speak his boastful words, hence he makes the suitable changes in the verse before us; so, too, with the effect of Daniel's words on the king. The rendering of Theodotion coincides nearly with the text of the Massorites, save that <span class="accented">hoychal is</span> translated "temple" rather than "palace" <span class="accented">-</span> a translation which usage quite permits. The Peshitta retains the double meaning. One, of the great buildings erected by an <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> or Babylonian monarch was his palace, which had also the character of a temple. In the case of the Ninevite monarchs, the walls of the palace were adorned with sculptures, portraying the principal events of the monarch's reign. This not impossibly might be the case with the palace of Nebuchadnezzar. Babylon as a city seems to have been practically rebuilt by him - his bricks are the most numerous of any found in Babylonia.

Theodotion and the Peshitta in the main agree with the received text. It is one of the characteristics of the earlier Chaldean monarchs who reigned over the small Chaldean cantons in Mesopotamia, that they named their capital city from themselves, as Bit-Dakuri and Bit-Adini; the capital of Merodach-Baladan was called after his father, Bit-Jakin. We need scarcely explain that <span class="accented">bit</span> represents <span class="accented">beth</span>, "house." In all ages an imperial power has expressed its greatness in the splen-dour of its capital, but in the case of the Babylonian Empire, Nebuchadnezzar was the empire, therefore the splendour of the city was a testimony to his glory.

To the rising of the sun another king shall rejoice in thy house and shall <span class="accented">possess</span> thy glory and thy might and thy dominion." The differences between the Massoretic and Theodotion are inconsiderable. The Peshitta adds the clause, "wet with the dew of heaven," to the description of the humiliation of Nebuchadnezzar; and to the account of the supremacy of the God of heaven adds, "and raises to it the humble man." This latter clause seems like a faint echo of the more precise statement of the LXX. The Vulgate differs here only as in the former case, omitting the causative. The reference in the LXX. to a special person in the house of Nebuchadnezzar, exalted upon his throne, appears to support an idea thrown out by Lenormant. Neri-glissar, the son-in-law of Nebuchadnezzar and the <span class="accented">successor</span> of Evil-Merodach, claims to be the son of Bel-zikir-iskun, King of Babylon (Lenormant, 'La Divination,' 204), but in the list of Ptolemy there is no such name; hence Lenormant imagines that this Belzikir-iskun usurped the throne for a short while, too short to be in the canon of Ptolemy. There is no trace of such a usurpation in the contract tables. Rawlin-son's hypothesis is difficult to believe. It is that this Belzikir-iskun was king in Babylon before the fall of the Assyrian Empire, before Nabepolassar. But from the accession of Nabopolassar to the death of Evil-Merodach is sixty-five or sixty-six years. A man of the age implied was little likely to take part in a revolution or leave behind him an infant son. It is difficult to decide, but it must be admitted that Lenormant's position is at all events a possible solution of the question.

The verse that is placed as parallel with this in the Septuagint differs very considerably. In the LXX. this verse is still part of the proclamation of the angel, "<span class="accented">Early</span> shall all these things be completed upon thee, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Baby-Ion, and nothing shall be awanting of all these things." This verse is properly without a correspondent in the Massoretic text. The next verse resumes the proclamation, "I Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon was bound seven years, and they fed me with grass as an ox. I ate from herbs of the earth." Then after a verse which Tischen-doff marks as an interpolation, but which really is a misplaced doublet, we have a continuation of ver. 30 (33 Authorized Version), "And my hairs became like feathers of an eagle, and my nails like those of the lion, and my flesh and my heart were changed, and I walked naked with the beasts of the earth." The fact that this is longer than the Massoretic text is decidedly against it. It seems to be a para-phrastic rendering of a text somewhat similar to the Massoretic. On the other hand, the fact that it retains the first person makes it at least possible that the condensation of the middle portion of this chapter, according to the received text, is not resorted to in this recension. It is to be noted that only a very few words in the Septuagint necessitate any idea of condensation: only in the beginning of ver. 27 Septuagint (28 Aramaic, 31 Authorized Version) is there a change of persons. This verse is rendered by Theodotion in a way much like the Massoretic text. The first portion of the verse is an exact translation of the Aramaic, but at the end the' rendering is, "till his hairs grew like those of lions, and his malls as those of birds." The Peshitta agrees exactly with the Massoretic. One cannot help being suspicious of this assertion of the hair being like eagles' feathers, partly because the eagle is a bird, and "birds" are spoken of in the next clause of the verse, and further there appears to be a pun on the last portion of the king's name in the word used for "eagle" (<span class="accented">nesher</span>). The Jewish scribes were prone to have such plays on names. Early in history it occurs, as when Abigail makes use of it to David in regard to her husband (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>), "Nabal is his name, and folly is with him." This possibly is the reason for the Hebrew variation in the name given to the Babylonian Nabu-kudur-utzur. Theodotion's version shows the result of reasoning - it is a scribe's emendation. That matted hair should have an appearance which suggested the feathers of birds, is natural enough, aria the utter inattention to matters of personal <span class="accented">cleanliness is</span> an exceedingly common symptom in cases of insanity. This personal neglect would naturally result also in the growth of the nails, and their incurring would give them vaguely the appearance of lions' claws. We can picture the Babylonian monarch that had, like his Ninevite predecessors, been finical about his curled locks and trimmed and jewelled fingers, walking in wild nakedness so far as his  shackles permitted him, with hair-matted locks, and his nails misshapen and long. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34</a></div><div class="verse">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion <i>is</i> an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom <i>is</i> from generation to generation:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.</span> If the translator of the Septuagint had the Massoretic text before him, he has gone utterly away from it, and gives us a mere paraphrase, "And after seven years I gave my soul to prayer, and besought concerning my sins at the presence of the Lord, the God of heaven, and prayed concerning mine ignorances to the great God of gods." There is another version of this verse, for this which we have given has been misplaced. The verse which appears in the proper place, though also very different from the Massoretic, is as different from that we have just given, "And at the end of seven years the time of my redemption came, and my sins and mine ignorances were fulfilled before the God of heaven, and I besought concerning my ignorances the God of gods, and behold an angel out of heaven called to me, saying, Nebuchadnezzar, serve the holy God of heaven, and give glory to the Highest; the kingdom of thy nation has been restored to thee." The latter clause has the look of leading into the following verse. One cannot but feel that there is in both the work of the paraphrast, but at the same time, he seems, in both cases, to have been working with a different text from that of the Massoretes. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree accurately with the Massoretic. The sudden gleam of intelligence that broke the spell of madness is a perfectly natural termination to an attack like that under which Nebuchadnezzar suffered. The tranquillizing effect of prayer is well known. The ascription of praise in the liturgic formula here given is not unlike what we find in the Ninevite remains. Bevan suggests as a parallel, Euripides' 'Bacchae,' where there is a recovery from madness accompanied with looking up. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a></div><div class="verse">And all the inhabitants of the earth <i>are</i> reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and <i>among</i> the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?</span> The rendering of the Septuagint here is very difficult to follow, from the state of confusion in which the text is. The verse that comes next in order is very short," At that time my kingdom was set up, and my glory was restored to me." This is a condensed statement of what is recorded in the following verse (ver. 36; 33 Massoretic), and we shall consider it in that connection. The verse which succeeds suits more the conclusion of such a letter or proclamation as is here represented, so far as form goes, though the matter shows traces of exaggeration and amplification natural to the Jew. At the same time, it bears a resemblance to the last verse of this chapter, according to the Massoretes, only greatly amplified. It may thus be best to regard this verse as not present in the Septuagint text. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The statement here is true, but Jewish, not Babylonian, in colour. This, along with its absence from the Septuagint, leads us to believe it to be the insertion of a Jewish scribe. On the other hand, it looks like a statement in brief of what we find expanded in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. and elsewhere. If brevity is to be regarded as an evidence of antiquity, this passage might be taken as the more ancient. It is, however, too bald and prosaic to be the original of such an impassioned passage as that in <a href="../../par/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40</a>. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-36.htm">Daniel 4:36</a></div><div class="verse">At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellers and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me</span>. As we have already mentioned, the verse in the Septuagint text which agrees to this is very brief, "At that time my kingdom was set up and my glory restored to me." It may be a condensation of some independent scribe, carried to a greater degree in the one case than the other. Only from the genesis of our Daniel, as we have imagined it, it would seem more probable that the briefer forms are the more primitive, and the longer the result of the expansion to be credited to imaginative copyists. In proof of this it is to be observed that neither Theodotion nor the Peshitta exactly represents the Massoretic text. Theodotion renders, "At that time my intellect (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) was restored to me, and came to the glory of my king-dora, and my beauty ("form," <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) returned to me, and my rulers and nobles sought me, and I was confirmed upon my kingdom, and more abundant greatness was added unto me." The Peshitta differs somewhat from this, "And when my intellect returned to me, my nobles and my great army sought me, and to my kingdom was I restored, and its great inheritance was increased to me." The differences between these two and the Massoretic text are slight compared with those that separate any one of those from the Septuagint; yet starting with the Septuagint text, the others are easily reached by slightly varying additions. The Peshitta certainly more clearly  portrays what seems likely to have taken place - first, a revolution during the king's madness, and a counter-revolution to restore him when his reason returned. If, however, Nebuchadnezzar was simply confined in a portion of the palace, then his nobles, on the news of his restoration, might seek unto him. None of the texts presents quite a self-consistent representation. If we could perfectly unravel the confusion of the texts which form our present Septuagint text, we should probably find one of them nearly self-consistent. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a></div><div class="verse">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works <i>are</i> truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment; and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</span> The Septuagint Version has all the appearance of an original composition by a scribe, not impossibly in imitation of the Song of the Three Holy Children, taking as its theme the subject of the verse before us, "I confess and praise the Highest, who created the heaven and the earth and the sea. He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, and King of kings, because he doeth signs and wonders, and changeth seasons and times, taking away the kingdoms of kings and setting up others instead of them. Now from this time I shall worship him, and from fear of him trembling hath taken hold of me, and all the holy ones I praise, for the gods of the nations have not power in themselves to turn away the kingdom of a king to another king, and to kill and to make alive, and to do signs and marvels great and fearful; and to change very great matters according as the God of heaven did to me, and charged to me great things. I will offer sacrifices to the Highest every day of nay reign for my life, for a savour of sweet smell before the Lord, and what is pleasing before him I shall do, and the people and my nation and the countries which are in my dominion. And as many as shall speak against the God of heaven, and as many as shall be taken saying anything, these shall I condemn to death." Several of the phrases in this short hymn - for that it rather is than a version of an Aramaic original - are derived from other portions of Scripture; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "for a savour of a sweet smell before the Lord." There are traces also of the familiar phenomenon of "doublets." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. So far as the Massoretic text represents the original Daniel, there is no evidence that Nebuchadnezzar had ceased to be a worshipper of Bel-Marduk and Nebo and Nergal. Certainly he recognizes that Jehovah is to be worshipped also. Further, it is to be admitted that Nebuchadnezzar carries his adoration very near the point of true and exclusive worship. In what he came short it may be that he yielded to the political necessities of his situation - as Naaman bowing in the temple of Rimmon. Even an autocrat like Nebuchadnezzar would be conditioned by those who served him, and after his madness he would be specially under the power of those officials who had restored him to his place. <span class="accented">Excursus on Nebuchadnezzar's Madness.</span> The events of the fourth chapter of Daniel are full of elements that have caused question from the days of Porphyry downwards. Many of these have been discussed as they occurred in the narrative. The question of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar has several features which cause it to be of interest. Some of these have been passingly treated in reference to the passages in which they are mentioned. But to a thorough understanding of the matter it is well to collect these features together and discuss it as a whole. To do so effectively, we shall have to consider <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the nature of the disease under which Nebuchadnezzar suffered; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the length of time during which he was under it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> what evidence there is in the narrative, or on the monuments, of political changes during the time he was incapacitated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The disease under which Nebuchadnezzar suffered. Dr. Pusey says (p. 428), "It is now conceded that the madness of Nebuchadnezzar agrees with the description of a rare sort of disease called lycanthropy, of which our earliest notice is a Greek medical writer of the fourth century after our Lord, in which the sufferer retains his consciousness in other respects, but imagines himself to be changed into some animal, and acts up to a certain point in conformity with that persuasion. Those who imagined themselves changed into wolves, howled like wolves, and (there is reason to believe, falsely) accused themselves of bloodshed." Archdeacon Rose, in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' says, "There is now no question that the disease under which Nebuchadnezzar is said to have suffered, is one of a well-known class of diseases known by such names as lycanthropy, kynanthropy, etc., according to the animal whose habits are simulated by the subject of this disease." There is no question that there was a disease that was so called: Dr. Pusey has collected proof of that. It is to be noted that all the instances he quotes are from ancient writers. It occurred also in Mediaeval times. The point that is not quite so certain is that Nebuchadnezzar had this disease. In the first place, <span class="accented">lycanthropy</span> has a distinct and definite meaning in mental pathology.  Those suffering from it "abandon their homes and make for the forests, that they may consort with those they imagine to be their kind; they allow their hair and nails to grow; they carry their imitation so far as to become ferocious, and mutilate and even to kill and devour children." Here we must observe that the neglect of the person, with the result of hair and nails growing, is not peculiar to that form of madness, but is really common to many varieties of mental disease. The two other characteristics are more special - the endeavour to consort with animals of the species to which the patient imagines himself to belong, and the destructive ferocity that in the form of wolf-madness, <span class="accented">lycanthropy</span>, properly so called, led to cannibalism. Of neither of these symptoms have we any indubitable evidence in the narrative. In regard to the first, of Nebuchadnezzar it is certainly said (vers. 15, 23) that "his portion" should" be with the beasts of the field;" ver. 25, "Thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field;" but here there is nothing to indicate that Nebuchadnezzar did this out of a mad overmastering longing. Rather, the very opposite is implied by the statement (vers. 25, 32)," They shall <span class="accented">drive</span> thee from men, and thy dwelling," etc. So in ver. 33 it is said, "And he was <span class="accented">driven</span> from men." The question may be said to turn on the force of the word "they." It certainly may mean that the angels of God, as avenging spirits, might drive Nebuchadnezzar from men, and that his longing to consort with animals may have been the scourge that drove him, but that is not said or implied. It may have been the members of his own household that so drove him forth directly, or it may have been the indirect result of the cruel treatment intended to be curative. It may be urged that the statement, "Let a beast's heart be given him," implies this longing to consort with animals. In the first place, "heart," <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">lebab</span>), among the Shemites does not, as among Occidentals, mean the longing appetitive part of our nature, but really the spirit. In the next place, the reading in the Septuagint is quite different; it is not the "heart," <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">lebab</span>), but the "body," <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">besar</span>) instead of   =    =  -<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>. (<span class="accented">lebab</span>). Indeed, when we turn to the Septuagint, we find a total want of all this appearance of abandoning house and home. In the statement of the dream (ver. 11, LXX.), "And it [the tree] was dragged and torn out, and in brazen fetters and shackles was it bound with them." Again, in the interpretation (ver 18, LXX.), "And they shall put thee in guard, and send thee to a desert place." When we turn to the fulfilment of the dream (ver. 25. LXX.), we find, "And the angels of heaven shall drive thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f7d;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) seven years, and thou shalt not be seen nor speak with any man; and thou shalt eat grass as an ox, and thy pasture shall be from the herb of the field." Again (vers. 27, 28. LXX.), "I was bound for seven years, and they fed me with grass as an ox, and my hairs became like eagles' feathers, and my nails like lions' claws, and my flesh and my heart were changed, and I walked naked among the beasts of the earth." The more I studied this, the less I was satisfied with the all-but universal decision that Nebuchadnezzar suffered under lycanthropy. Having a friend a specialist in mental disease, I submitted the case to him, giving him, in addition to what he found in his English Bible, the version or' the Septuagint. He is eminently qualified to judge all questions of mental disease. David Yellowlees, Esq., M.D., is head of one of the largest lunatic asylums in Scotland, Gartnavel, near Glasgow. He has been President of the Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain; is Lecturer on Insanity in the University of Glasgow; and has had over thirty years' experience in the treatment of mental disease. He kindly wrote me the following, which he has permitted me to publish: - Nebuchadnezzar's illness was <span class="accented">not</span> lycanthropy; it was an attack of acute mania, which recovered, as such attacks usually do if uncomplicated, in seven months. Acute mania, in its extreme forms, exhibits all kinds of degraded habits, such as stripping off and tearing of clothes, eating filth and garbage of all sorts, wild and violent gesticulations, dangerous assaults, howling noises, and utter disregard of personal decency. The patient often is liker a wild animal than a human being. These symptoms merely show the completeness of the aberration, and do not at all indicate a hopeless condition. On the contrary, they are seen most frequently in the cases which recover. The king was apparently treated as kindly as the enlightenment of the times permitted - bound when injuring himself or others, taken to a desert place away from other men, and allowed a mad freedom, in which his attacks found relief and eventual recovery. In another communication, Dr. Yellowlees says, "The 'seven times' certainly did not mean seven years for recovery from that form of insanity; that is, acute mania would be most unlikely after so long a time. Seven months is a far more likely period." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> This leads us to consider the second question - the length of time during which Nebuchadnezzar was under this malady.  The phrase which states the duration occurs four times - vers. 16 (13), 23 (20), 25 (22), 32 (29) - and is always the same, "till seven times pass over him (thee)." <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">sheebeah</span> '<span class="accented">iddaneen yahelephoon</span> '<span class="accented">alohee</span>). The question turns on the sense to be given to '<span class="accented">iddan.</span> This word is found thirteen times in this book - nine times besides the four times in this chapter. We find it three times in the second chapter, where it means the time during which certain planetary and stellar influences were at work. This naturally suggests the signs of the Zodiac and the phases of the moon, and therefore a month, though the probability is that the period in the king's mind was much shorter. The ruling phases of the moon would make a fourfold or threefold division not improbable, while the positions of the planets in the various astrological houses make it more likely that a day rather than even a month is meant. We find the word next in the following chapter (vers. 5 and 15), "At what time ('<span class="accented">iddan</span>) ye hear," etc. Here it means a point of time, and in the other verse (7), where the phrase occurs we have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">zimena</span>), which usually means a set, fixed point of time. We find it again in the seventh chapter (vers. 12 and 25). In the twelfth verse, after the destruction of the fourth beast, the other beasts continue for "a season and time," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">z'man ve'iddan</span>); it here means a space of time totally indefinite. In the twenty-fifth verse the word in question occurs three times in the phrase, "a time, times, and a dividing of time." Here it has been assumed to mean "a year," and this is certainly not improbable for this particular case; but nothing can be drawn from this as to the sense of the word elsewhere. So far as the usage of this book is concerned, we can say the word '<span class="accented">iddan</span> means a space of time, the length of which is determined by the context. When we pass into the Targums, we find the same, or, if possible, even greater freedom of use. It is used for the time of old age in <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/71-9.htm">Psalm 71:9</a>; in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3</a>. for "the times." There is a phrase, '<span class="accented">iddan be'iddan</span> ("time in times"), which is commonly understood to mean a year. This would render it probable that the word was originally some period much shorter than a year, probably a month; thus <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/24-55.htm">Genesis 24:55</a>, where we render, according to the Massoretic, "a few days, at least ten." Onkelos renders, '<span class="accented">iddan be'iddan</span> '<span class="accented">o</span> '<span class="accented">asrah yarheen</span> ("time in time, or ten months"), where the word certainly means "months." The usage of the Peshitta is much the same. Gaon Saadia would assign to '<span class="accented">iddan</span> here the sense of "month;" in this he is followed by Lenormant. Notwithstanding the objections of critics and lexicographers, we venture to follow these two authorities the more readily that the critics have assigned no reason why we should not do so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Is there any trace in the inscriptions surviving to us to throw light on this mysterious event? At one time it was supposed that in the Standard Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar we had a distinct reference to this period of madness. <span class="accented">As</span> at first translated, Nebuchadnezzar declared that for four years he did not occupy himself in building. A series of further negative sentences followed. More careful study and more accurate rendering have removed that misconception. From the nature of the Standard Inscription, it was <span class="accented">a priori</span> unlikely that anything of the kind supposed should have been found in it. It is a record of the various buildings, etc., he had constructed for the honour of the gods and the beauty of his capital. The dates of the erection of these edifices or the construction of these canals is net given; so the fact of years in which nothing was done is not necessarily noticeable. Lenormant ('La Divination,' 204) makes another suggestion. When he ascends the throne, after the murder of his brother-in-law, Evil-Merodach, we find Neriglissar (Nergalsharezer) claiming that his father, Bil-zikir-iskun, had been King of Babylon. Lenormant's theory is that Bil-zikir-iskun reigned' while Nebuchadnezzar was thus incapacitated by madness. Certainly, between the accession of Nabo-polassar in  <span class="date">B.C. 625</span>, to the death of Evil-Merodach in  <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, there is no sovereign but the three members of the one dynasty. Rawlinson ('Five Great Monarchies') places him immediately before Nabopolassar, and reads his name Nebu-sum-iskun. But as deposition meant death, this would imply that his son - Neriglissar - even if only an infant, at the death of his father, would be at least sixty-five years of age at the death of Evil-Merodach. This is not an age when men engage in conspiracies. But more, he leaves behind him an infant son. While not impossible, this is an unlikely solution. If, then, he did not reign before Nabo-polassar, there must have been some interval in which he held the throne while the legitimate occupant was incapacitated by disease or distance from the capital It was not during the interval between the death of Nabopolassar and the accession of Nebuchadnezzar, because Berosus tells us of the rapid march Nebuchadnezzar made through the desert from Syria to reach Babylon before any usurpation took place. It did not take place between the death of Nebuchadnezzar  and the accession of Evil-Merodach, for, from the contract tables, there seems to have been no interval of uncertainty. Bel-zikir-iskun may have, so M. Lenormant thinks, usurped the throne during the illness of Nebuchadnezzar. If the interval were less than a year, Ptolemy might not insert the name in his chronicle. Against this theory is the fact that throughout the whole of Nebuchadnezzar's reign there never is seven months without a contract preserved to us, dated by the years of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. This is not absolutely conclusive, because some of the contract tables, after the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus, are still dated by the reign of Nabunahid. We are compelled to abandon the position that we have any trace of this madness. We have an analogous case in the history of Nabunahid; for a long period, not less than five years, he was unable to take part in the business of the empire. Meantime, there is no indication in the contract tables that anything is wrong. The annals of Nabunahid reveal to us the fact that the king s son was acting monarch; but had these not come down to us, we should never have known of any incapacity befalling this monarch. Bel-zikir-iskun may have acted as monarch during Nebuchadnezzar's illness, and this may have been the fact that enabled Neff-glissar to assert his father to have been King of Babylon. It is not impossible that Nebuchadnezzar's decree may yet turn up from the rubbish of ages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 3"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 5"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/5.htm"><title>Daniel 5 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/5.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/5.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/5-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/4.htm" title="Daniel 4">&#9668;</a> Daniel 5 <a href="../daniel/6.htm" title="Daniel 6">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-1.htm">Daniel 5:1</a></div><div class="verse">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-31.</span> - BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST. In regard to this chapter the peculiar state of the Septuagint text has to be noted. At the beginning of the chapter there are three verses which seem to be either variant versions of the Septuagint text, or versions of a text which was different from that from which the Septuagint has been drawn. Throughout the chapter, further, there are traces of doublets. Most of these variations occur in the Syriac of Paulus Tellensis.  <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine</span> <span class="cmt_word">before the thousand. As we</span> have just indicated, there are two versions in the Septuagint of several verses in this chapter, and the verse before us is one of these. The first of these is "Baltasar the king made a great feast on the day of the dedication of his palace, and invited from his lords two thousand men." The other reading, which appears to have formed the text, is, "Baltasar the king made a great feast for his companions." The first version seems to have read the dual instead of the singular - a proof of the state of the language, for the dual has practically disappeared in the Targums. The second version has evidently read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. Theodotion reads, "Baltasar the king made a great feast to thousands of his lords, and drank wine before the thousands." The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic text. The numeral is thus omitted in the text of the Septuagint,inserted in the dual in the margin, and appears in Theodotion in the plural. As the shortest text is also the oldest, and omits the numeral, we feel inclined to do so also, the more so as the numeral may have resulted from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">aluph</span>) being put as the interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<span class="accented">rabrab</span>). The clause in the marginal version, "on the day of the dedication of his palace," or, as it is rendered by Paulus Telleusis, "in the day of the dedication of the house of his kingdom," is worthy of notice. From the fact that early in his reign every Ninevite king seems to have begun a palace, this statement has a great deal of verisimilitude. The clause in the Massoretic text, "and drank wine before the thousand," is meaningless, unless as a rhetorical amplification. From the fact that only the first clause appears in the text of the Septuagint, the authenticity of the rest of the verse is rendered doubtful; the more so that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> () means "a feast" in Eastern Aramaic, though not in Western. It is a possible solution of the presence of the clause that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, excluded from the text and its place supplied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span>, was placed in the margin. <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, however, means "before." If there was also in the margin <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span>, "thousands," in the emphatic state; as the translation into Hebrew of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;</span> (<a href="../../par/genesis/36-17.htm">Genesis 36:17, 15</a> Onkelos). If, further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "companion," appeared as a various reading for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, that would easily be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span>, "wine;" the verb "to drink" would be added to complete the sense. We have thus all the elements to produce the different versions of the story of the feast. The fact that in what we regard as the marginal reading the clause appears quite differently rendered, confirms us in our suspicion that the Massoretic text presents a case of a "doublet." The reading which begins the chapter in the LXX. may be due to regarding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> as the verb "to receive." The name Belshazzar has been the occasion of much controversy. It was regarded as one of the proofs of the non-historicity of Daniel that this name occurred at all (as Bertholdt). We were told that the last King of Babylon was Nabunahid, not Belshazzar. The name, however, has turned up in the Mugheir inscription as the son of Nabunahid, and not only so, but in a connection that implies he was associated in the government. From the annals of Nabunahid (2 col.; <span class="accented">vide</span> ' Beitrage zur As-syriologie,' Delitzsch and Haupt, 1891-92, pp. 218-221) we find that from his seventh to his eleventh year, if not from an earlier to a later date, Nabunahid was in retirement in Tema, and "came not to Babil," and the king's son (<span class="accented">Mar Sarri</span>) was with the nobles (<span class="accented">rabuti</span>) snd the army. Even when the king's mother died, the mourning was carried on by the king's sou, Belshazzar. Dr. Hugo Winckler ('Geschichte Babyloniens u. Assuriens,' pp. 315, 316) says Nabunahid remained intentionally far from the capital, and abode continually in Tema, a city otherwise unknown. Not once at the new year's feast, where his personal presence was indispensable, did he come to Babylon. What occasioned it, we know not; but it appears as if he had devoted himself to some kind of solitary life, and would not disturb himself with the business of government. Not once while Cyrus was marching against Babylon did he rouse himself, but allowed things to take their course. The government appears to have been carried on by his son, Bel-shar-utzur, for while Nabunahid lived in Tema in retirement, it is mentioned that his son, with the dignitaries, managed affairs in Babylon, and commanded the army. Also in several inscriptions in the concluding prayer, he is named along with his father, while it is usually the name of the king that is there mentioned. Belshazzar is, then, no mere luxurious despot, like the Nabeandel of Josephus, no incapable youth flushed with the unexpected dignity of government in the city of Babylon, while his father was shut up in Borsippa; he is a bold capable warrior. Tyrannical and imperious he may be, yet faithful to his father, as had Nebuchadnezzar been to Nabopolassar his father. We need not even look at the identifications of Belshazzar with Evil-Merodach, with Labasi-marduk,  or with Nabunahid. The name <span class="accented">Bel-shar-utzur</span> means "Bel protects the king," and is rendered in the Greek versions "Baltasar," and in the Vulgate "Baltassar," and identical with the name given to Daniel, as we have remarked elsewhere. In the Peshitta the name here is rendered "Belit-shazar," while Daniel's Babylonian name is "Beletshazzar." We do not know when this feast took place. If we take the Septuagint text here as our guide, it did not take place at the capture of the city by Cyrus. If for five, six, or seven years he was practically king, Belshazzar may have built a palace, and the feast may have been held at its dedication. We knew that the Babylonians were notorious for their banquets  - banquets that not infrcquently ended in drunkenness. Although the number of the guests is doubtful from diplomatic reasons, the number itself is not excessive. We read of Alexander the Great having ten thousand guests. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-2.htm">Daniel 5:2</a></div><div class="verse">Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which <i>was</i> in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</span> The Septuagint has included the last clause of the Massoretic recension of the first verse, "And he drank wine, and his heart was lifted up, and he commanded to bring the vessels of gold and of silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from Jerusalem, and to pour out wine in them for those companions of his (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>)." The translator seems to have regarded the first syllable of the name Belshazzar as a separate word, and has translated it according to the meaning the word has in Eastern Aramaic, "heart" (<a href="../../par/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, Peshitta). After this initial mistake - if mistake it was - the remaining change was easy. The syntax here, according to the Massoretic text, is different from what we should expect. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> ('<span class="accented">amar</span>), "to say," is translated "command" in eight cases in this book, and in every other case it is followed immediately by the infinitive' of the action commanded. Hence we are inclined, with the LXX., to omit "whiles he tasted the wine." While the LXX. Aramaic seems to have <span class="aramaic">&#x5d1;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>, "in them," it has not had "king," "wives," or "concubines." As the Septuagint is the shorter, on the whole, we prefer it, though we maintain the Massoretic reading of "in them," referring to the vessels. Theodotion and the Peshitta follow the Massoretic reading. Whether or not the libation offered to the gods was in the mind of the writer, the mere fact that the sacred vessels were used for the purposes of a common feast was desecration. The addition of the "wives" and "concubines" adds at once to the degradation in the eyes of an Eastern, and to the stately rhetorical cadence of the verse. This renders all the stronger the suspicion engendered by the omission of these features in the Septuagint. It is to be observed that the Septuagint translator must have had an Eastern Aramaic manuscript before him, or he could never have translated <span class="accented">bal</span> "heart." At the same time, the presence of women at Babylonian feasts was not so uncommon as it was in the rest of the East, as we learn from the Ninevite remains. Certainly Quintus Curtius mentions this in connection with Alexander's visit to Babylon (v. 1). But was an obscure Jew likely to know this in Palestine? It is very difficult for a person writing in a different age to keep strictly to verisimilitude in these matters. Even a contemporary may make a blunder in writing, not a novel, but a biography, as Froude, in his 'Life of Carlyle,' declares he was "quietly married in the parish church of Temple." To be <span class="accented">quietly</span> married in a parish church in any part of Scotland, in the early years of this century, would be a contradiction in terms. Yet Froude had often been in Scotland, and knew Carlyle well. Could a Jew living in Palestine have all his wits about him so as to note every varying feature which distinguished the habits of Babylon from those of the rest of the East? The question may be asked why were the vessels of the Lord in Jerusalem singled out to be desecrated by a common use? It might, of course, be that the sacred vessels of the temples of the gods of all conquered nationalities were brought in, and thus that the singling out of the Jewish sacred vessels was due, not to the preference of the Babylonian monarch, but to the Jew, who saw only those. We think this can scarcely be. It was certainly the policy of Nabunahid to draw all worship to Babylon (Annals of Nabunahid, col. 3. line 20, "The gods of Akkad, which Nabunabid had brought to Babylon, were carried back to their city"). But this would lead him to avoid anything that would savour of disrespect to these gods whom he had brought to dwell in Babylon. We do not think it would have been merely the beauty of those vessels that led to their desecration, for the temple at Jerusalem had suffered several plunderings before the capture of the city, and the period between the age of Hezekiah and Zedekiah was not one in which wealth and artistic talent were likely to increase. Some suspicion must have reached the court of Babylon that the Jews were in league with Cyrus; perhaps the contents of  the second Isaiah had reached the knowledge of the Babylonian police. If so, the act of Belshazzar was an act of defiance against Jehovah of Israel. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-3.htm">Daniel 5:3</a></div><div class="verse">Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which <i>was</i> at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> <span class="cmt_word">they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in</span> <span class="cmt_word">them. They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</span> The corresponding verses in the Septuagint differ in several points from those above; the Septuagint third verse contains, condensed, the Massoretic third and fourth verses, but adds new matter in its fourth verse: "(3) And they were brought, and they drank in them, and blessed their idols made with hands; (4) and the God the eternal, who hath dominion over their spirit ('breath,' <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>), they did not bless." In the introductory portion, which contains, as we think, marginal readings, we have the second and fourth verses brought into connection, "In that day Baltasar, being uplifted with wine, and boasting himself, praised in his drink all the gods of the nations, the molten and the carved, but to God the Highest he gave not praise." The reading of the latter portion of this seems better than the text, as it is briefer; the description of God as he that has power "over their breath," is a preparation for what we find in ver. 23, "and thy breath is in his hand." Theodotion is, as usual, much nearer the Massoretic text, but while the Massoretic only mentions the "golden" vessels being brought, Theodotion mentions the silver also, and the verb <span class="accented">hanpiqoo</span> is translated singular, as if it were <span class="accented">hanpayq</span>, and "Nebuchadnezzar" understood. A various reading adds, "and the God of eternity, who hath power of their breath, did they not bless," according to the Alexandrine and Vatican codices. In both these cases Jerome follows Theodotion. The Peshitta agrees only in the latter, putting the verb in the singular. Modern translators, as Luther and Ewald, the Authorized and Revised English Versions, retain the plural, but make the verb passive, as if it were written <span class="accented">honpaqoo.</span> Calvin alone preserves both number and voice. The French Version, which makes it impersonal, is probably as good as any. It is, however, not impossible that the true reading is huphal; that seems better than Calvin's suggestion, that what Nebuchadnezzar had done is now transferred to all the Babylonians. The praises of the gods being sung was especially natural, if this were a dedication of a palace. In such a case the various elemental deities would be invoked to bless the residence of the king. The fact that the vessels belonging to the temple of the God of the Jews were brought forward from the treasury of Bel would afford an occasion for praising Bel, the god who had given them the victory. While they praised these god, of the nations, they did not even mention Jehovah - an addition in the text of Theodotion and the LXX., both text and margin, and therefore one that, we think, ought, in some form, to lie in the text. It is singular that in the Cyrus Cylinder, 17, the overthrow of Nabunahid is attributed to Marduk, "whom Nabunahid did not fear." The reason of Belshazzar thus ostentatiously praising the gods might be to get over the reputation of unfaithfulness to the gods, which was weakening them, father and <span class="accented">son</span>, in their struggle with Cyrus. Belshazzar most likely was, at this very time, carrying on war against Cyrus. The object of this festive gathering of his nobles might be to hearten them in their struggle against the King of Persia.

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-5.htm">Daniel 5:5</a></div><div class="verse">In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the same hour oame forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote</span>. The two versions given in the Septuagint here do not seriously differ from each other or from the Massoretic text, only that they both omit "the part of," and represent the king as seeing the hand. Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, which maybe rendered "finger-joints;" otherwise this version is very like both the Massoretic and the LXX. The Peshitta presents no point of remark. The word translated "lamp" (<span class="accented">nebhrashta</span>) became in Talmudic times the equivalent of <span class="accented">menoorah</span>, "the golden candlestick." From this it has been supposed that "the candlestick" was the golden candlestick which later proved the crowining glory of Titus's triumph, and is still to be seen carved on his arch. When the other vessels of the house of the Lord were brought to deck the table of the monarch, it would not be unnatural that the golden candlestick should also be brought. In the great hall in which a thousand guests were accommodated, more lamps than one would be required. The Septuagint (text) adds, "over against the king:" this would individualize the lamp referred to; but there does not seem to be any support for this reading, which may be due to the desire to explain the <span class="accented">satatus emphaticus.</span> Gesenius derives the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;</span>, "<span class="accented">light</span>," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;</span>, "flame." As <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> as a consonant was unused in Assyrian, this derivation is by no means impossible We know that the Ninevite monarchs surrounded the great halls of their palaces with <span class="accented">bas-reliefs</span> of their victories. The remains of Babylon have not given us anything like  the gypsum slabs of Kouyounjik. Yet the Babylonian monarchs not unlikely followed the same praetices as those of Nineveh. The walls were built and plastered, and then the slabs were moved up to them. In the case of Belshazzar, the palace walls might well be fresh; no gypsum slabs had yet recorded his prowess. As he looks to the white plaster, the fingers of a hand come out of the darkness, and write opposite him. "The king," thus it is in the Massoretic text, saw the "part" of the hand that wrote. <span class="accented">Pas</span> is the word. Furst renders it "wrist;" Gesenius, "the extremity;" Winer, <span class="accented">vola manus</span>," the hollow of the baud;" with this Buxtorf agrees. The balance of meanings seems to be in favour of "hollow of the hand," only it is difficult to understand the position of the hand relatively to the king when he saw the hollow of the hand. The smoke from the numerous lamps would obscure the roof of the hall of the palace; however numerous the lamps, their light would be unable to pierce the darkness, so out of the darkness came the hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-6.htm">Daniel 5:6</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</span> The Septuagint differs in a somewhat important degree from the Massoretic text, "And his countenance was changed, and fears and thoughts troubled him." In this clause not improbably <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> are double renderings of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>.

It is clear that the text from which the Septuagint had repeated the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">bebal</span>), which means originally "to hasten," and had the word "king "after it, if the Septuagint Aramaic were the original, we can easily understand how the word repeated might be omitted by <span class="accented">bomoioteleutoa.</span> While <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span> could easily be read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d8;</span> after the square character had got place, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5de;</span> could not in the script of the Egyptian Aramaic papyri be easily read <span class="aramaic">&#x5e7;&#x5dd;</span>. consequently we are inclined to look on the reading of the Septuagint here as being the primitive one. The king, according to this verse, saw the handwriting, but not till he rose did he see what was written. This representation of the succession of events is natural, whereas the statements about his loins being loosed is mere amplification. The last clause storms to be a misreading of the clause which appears in the Massoretic at the end (which see). The first word seems to have been misread <span class="accented">heberren</span>, and thus a meaning is violently given to the other parts of the clause. The probability is in favour of the Massoretic reading here, Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The omen of a hand appearing to write on the wall of the palace was one that might easily cause the thoughts of the king to trouble him. Much more was the omen of importance when the king saw that the hand which had appeared to write had actually left certain words written. It was but natural that the bright<span class="accented">ness</span> of the king's countenance should depart from him when he saw the hand. thus awfully coming out of the darkness, and writing, and that his knees should smite one upon another when what was written gleamed upon him from the wall before him. He might well be sure that the message so communicated would be laden with fate. Fear is naturally the first emotion occasioned by any mysterious occurrence; and then Babylon was, in all likelihood, being pressed by the advance of Cyrus. If he had any suspicion of the treachery that had sapped the power of his father, his apprehensions would be all the greater.

The Septuagint here also differs from the Massoretic text, "And the king cried out with a great cry to call in the enchanters (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c2;</span>) and sorcerers (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>), and Chaldeans, and soothsayers, to announce to him the interpretation of the writing, and they came in for inspection (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>), to see the writing, And they were not able to make known to the king the interpretation of the writing. Then the king made commandment, saying, Any man who shall show the interpretation of the writing, he shall put on him a purple robe, and shall put round his neck a golden chain, and authority shall be given him over a third part of the kingdom." Theodotion is an exact rendering of the Massoretic text in the sense represented by the English versions, save that it wholly omits the conjunctions between the various classes of wise men, so that <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> might be an adjective qualifying either <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, and the article is also omitted, which is represented in the Massoretic text by the <span class="accented">status emphaticus.</span> The Peshitta has  four classes of wise men called in; as the Septuagint has, otherwise it agrees with the Massoretic text. It is a matter of some interest to observe that the position of the Chaldeans is somewhat precarious here, as in the second chapter. They disappear wholly from the list in the next verse, which really seems to be another version of this. It is a marginal gloss that has crept into the text. If we accept the reading of the Septuagint here, so far at least as to assume the entrance of the wise men before the king's declaration of the reward, the succession of events becomes more natural. The king calls for the presence of these interpreters of omens, and then, when they fail to interpret the writing to him, he proclaims his offer of a reward to whoever can do so. It is to be noted that there is in the Septuagint no question of ability to read the writing, but simply to interpret it. It has been pointed out to me by a friend that if these words were written in cuneiform, the signs that would represent them might have a great variety of possible sounds, and with these differing sounds, differing meanings. Sometimes a sign was phonetic and a syllable, sometimes it was idiographic and might represent a whole word. There is this to be said for this view - the Assyrian was the writing expected in inscriptions. Still, from the fact that the Septuagint omits the demand that the inscription should be read, we may regard the matter as doubtful. Assuming that the wise men were required to read the inscription, some of the Jewish interpreters, as Jephet-ibn-Ali, think that the letters of the word were inverted; others have it that the letters were arranged in columns. Even, however, if the words were written correctly enough as Aramaic words, it would be a difficult matter to put any meaning in them as they stood, as we shall see when we consider Daniel's interpretation. The reward promised is of special interest. The word <span class="accented">argvana</span>, translated "scarlet," appears in Assyrian as <span class="accented">argmamm</span>; <span class="accented">hamneeka</span>, the word rendered "necklace," is of doubtful origin. We find in the Ninevite sculptures and on the cylinders from Babylon many instances of splendid robes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Rawlinson, 'Five Great Monarchies,' 560); the rich necklace is also to be seen (ibid., 2. 497,499). The great difficulty has arisen over the rank given to Daniel, "the third ruler in the kingdom." The difficulty is that the ordinal here is not in its usual form, although Petermann gives <span class="accented">taltu</span> as one of the forms of the ordinal. There is, further, the unusual position of the numeral in relation to the verb, though the abnormality is less than Professor Bevan represents it, as the Peshitta follows word for word the arrangement of the Massoretic text. The truth seems to be that the word really was <span class="accented">toolta</span>, as in the Syriac, and the difficulty has risen in not recognizing the transference from one dialect of Aramaic to another. It is used in the Peshitta (<a href="../../par/2_corinthians/10-2.htm">2 Corinthians 10:2</a>) of the third heaven. Professor Bevan's interpretation, that it means "<span class="accented">every</span> third day,') may be dismissed as absurd. Ewald (<span class="accented">in loc</span>.) regards the title as one of a board of three - not an in,possible meaning, in the light of what we find in the following chapter. Yet his reasoning, that it cannot be third in rank, because the queen-mother could not be counted in, is inept now, when we learn that Belshazzar was colleague with his father, and so the third place was all he had to give. On this question Behrmann takes the view discarded as impossible by Ewald, and holds that Daniel was placed third because of the queen-mother. It is one of the commonplaces of the criticism of this book that the history ascribed to Daniel is borrowed from the history of Joseph: why was the position offered not made "second," as was that of Joseph? We have the reason in what we know of the history of Babylon at the time. The Septuagint and Josephus were unaware of the facts, and translated as they did. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-8.htm">Daniel 5:8</a></div><div class="verse">Then came in all the king's wise <i>men</i>: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof</span>. As we have already said, the Septuagint here repeats the list of wise men. and omits "the Chaldeans." If the word "Chaldean" had been in the text originally, the fact that astrologers were frequently called Chaldeans would render it unlikely that the word should be omitted. Whereas from this very ground  it was a word specially apt to be added on the margin, and once on the margin it would easily drop into the text. Even in the case of the Massoretic text, there seems to be a repetition here. It is certainly more obvious in the Septuagint text. The verse according to the Septuagint is, "And there entered in the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the astrologers, and were not able to announce the interpretation of the writing." Theodotion agrees here with the received text; the Peshitta omits "all." The only way in which we can escape the idea of this being a repetition is by holding that the word "all" is emphatic. The omission of the word "all" from the Peshitta is against this. It is to be observed that in the Septuagint there is no reference to "reading the writing;" it is only to announce the interpretation. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-9.htm">Daniel 5:9</a></div><div class="verse">Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then was King Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied</span>. This verse presents signs also of being a repetition. The last clause appears to be the original form of the mysterious clause at the end of the sixth verse according to the Septuagint; the word <span class="accented">mishtabsheen</span>, which occurs here, seems to have been read <span class="accented">mishtabhareen</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">shab'har</span>), "to be glorious," in the ittaphel; this becomes "to boast one's self," as in the Targum of <a href="../../par/proverbs/25-14.htm">Proverbs 25:14</a>, also the Peshitta of the same passage; also <a href="../../par/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1</a>. And this is the word used by Paulus Tellensis to translate <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Septuagint has a verse here that has no equivalent in the Massoretic text, "Then the king called the queen about the sign, and showed her how great it was, and that no one had been able to declare to the king the interpretation of the writing." This verse avoids the repetition we find in the Massoretic text, and explains the presence of the queen in a much more plausible way than the received text does. In the Massoretic text it is the noise and tumult that pierces the women's apartments, and brings out the queen-mother; though not impossible, this is unlikely. The action of the king, as given in the Septuagint, is very probable. The wise men are baffled by this mysteriously appearing inscription. What is to be done? Belshazzar calls his mother, the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar, as she at least possibly was, to see if she knows anything in the past that might be a guide in such a matter. He not only shows her the sign, the inscription, but shows how great it was, by telling of the hand that had come out of the darkness, and had written it. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. While the repetition is obvious, it is also true that the failure of all the wise men in Babylon to read the writing, as the Massoretic text has it, would increase the trouble of the king, and this trouble would naturally spread to the courtiers. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-10.htm">Daniel 5:10</a></div><div class="verse"><i>Now</i> the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: <i>and</i> the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet-house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever; let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the King Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</span> No one can fail to feel the presence of rhetoric here, especially in the last verse, which, we may remark, has no equivalent in the Septuagint. We see the rhetorical character of these verses more clearly when we consider the ineptitude of the special powers ascribed to Daniel to meet the present difficulty. Interpretation of dreams was a common attribute ascribed to wisdom in the East of old, as it is yet. But this was not a dream, and therefore the qualification was not to the purpose; still less to the purpose are the attributes that follow. <span class="accented">Showing of hard sentences.</span> Giving riddles that nobody could read was an evidence of wisdom all over the East (see Josephus, 8:5. 3; besides Talmudic stories of Solomon). This, however, is not a case of competition in riddles; above all, there is no opportunity of one giving riddles in return. "Dissolving of doubts" is the solving of these riddles. These qualities, which the queen-mother, according to the Massoretic text, ascribes to Daniel, might make him delightful as a boon companion, but were not at all to the purpose in the matter troubling the king. The version of the Septuagint is much briefer, and, it seems to us, much more satisfactory, "Then the queen reminded him concerning Daniel, who was of the captivity of Judaea, and said to the king, The man was understanding, wise, and excelling all the wise men of Babylon, and there is a holy spirit in him, and in the days of the king thy father, he showed difficult (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span>) interpretations to Nebuchadnezzar thy father." This has every sign of having been translated; thus the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;</span>, which we have rendered, "reminded him concerning  Daniel." This use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;</span> is unknown in classic Greek. In Homer's 'Odyssey' it is accusative of person; in Plato, 'Laches,' 200 D, it is dative of person; in 'Legg.,' 3:688, it is accusative of person. It is, however, exactly parallel with <a href="../../par/genesis/40-14.htm">Genesis 40:14</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7c;</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> represents <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> in the Hebrew; in the Targum of Onkelos and in the Peshitta this is translated by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>; in Paulus Tellensis it is rendered by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span>. Moreover, according to the Massoretic text, Belshazzar asks Daniel if he is" that Daniel which art of the captivity of the children of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?" The queen-mother had said nothing, according to the verses before us as given in the Massoretic recension, of Daniel being a Jew. According to the Septuagint, the queen-mother tells him whence Daniel is. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text, save that it inserts "watchfulness" instead of "light," and omits the repetition of "thy father." The Peshitta is also substantially at one with our received text. One of the great difficulties which commentators have found in this part of the incident is how Belshazzar could be ignorant of Daniel. Various means have been adopted to get over the difficulty. One is that Daniel was away from Babylon up to this time (Jephet-ibn-Ali). Archdeacon Rose is certain he must have known about him. The explanation of this is as recumbent on the opponents of the authenticity of Daniel as on its defenders, for they - the latter - declare it the work of one author, and it has had powerful effect on people: it must be artistically written if it is not a record of facts. No artist in fictitious narrative would present to his readers so obvious a difficulty. We learn now what was the probable reason of Belshazzar's ignorance of Daniel. Nabu-nahid, a usurper, was at variance with the whole clergy, as we may call them, of Babylon, and most likely Daniel acted with the others, and possibly, as far back as the revolution in which Evil-Merodach perished, had been away from the court. It is the height of unfairness of any one to press the name here given to Nebuchadnezzar, "my father." That title was very loosely used among the Babylonians and Assyrians. Jehu is called "the son of Omri," although he had swept the race of Omri off the face of the earth. So Dr. hugo Winckler, in his ' Untersuchungen zur Attorientalischen Geschichte,' p. 53, note, says, "This word 'son' after the name of a Chaldean prince, is only to be taken in the sense of belonging to the same dynasty." Had the phrase used been that "Nebuchadnezzar slept with his fathers, and Belshazzar his son reigned in his stead," something might have been said for the view maintained by all critics, that the author thought Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar. How can the critics assert this, and yet, as does Professor Bevan, maintain this author intimate even with the minutest portions of Jeremiah, Kings, and Chronicles? If so, how is it that he did not know that both Kings and Jeremiah asserted Nebuchadnezzar to have been succeeded by Evil-Merodach? This information occupies too prominent a place in both books for him to have been ignorant of it. We can only understand his action in thus putting down Belshazzar as the son of Nebuchadnezzar by assuming his acceptance of usage. The critics cannot explain it. Those who maintain the traditional view may do so by saying that Daniel, writing at the time, knowing the real state of matters, the claim of Belshazzar to be descended from Nebuchadnezzar, the fact that Evil-Merodach had been killed, simply relates facts. Had he been inventing history, and acquainted with the holy books, and all the information they conveyed to everybody, he would of necessity have spent some pains in explaining how his history came to differ so much from what one could draw from the Books of Kings and Jeremiah. The two accounts of Saul's meeting with David are not comparable with this, as we find the reason of the contradiction in the coalescence of two different accounts.

There is a great deal of rhetoric in this, and the attempt to restore the stately etiquette of the Babylonian court. The king is represented as repeating very much what his mother had told him. It is to be observed that, although the queen-mother - as the Massoretic text records her words - has not spoken a word of Daniel's origin, and implies that Belshazzar knew noticing of  him, yet when he comes, Belshazzar addresses him as knowing who and whence he is. The suspicion that is engendered by the mere reading of the text as we have it is confirmed by a study of the Septuagint text, where these four verses shrink into very modest dimensions, "Then Daniel was brought <span class="accented">to</span> the king, and the king answered and said, O Daniel, art thou able to show me the interpretation of the writing? and I will clothe thee with purple, and put a gold chain about thy neck, and thou shalt have authority over a third part of my kingdom." The brevity of this, the utter want of rhetoric, not to speak of its dramatic verisimilitude to the speech of a man beside himself with terror, make it the more probable text. Condensation was rarely the work of a <span class="accented">falsarius</span>; he might omit statements that were antagonistic to some preconceived notion, or, if only a leaf or so remained of a parchment otherwise filled up, he might endeavour to utilize the space left him by putting down as much as he could of some work he valued. Then, in such a case, a copyist might really condense. But neither of these causes can explain the omission of the rhetorical passages here. We are compelled, then, to regard the text behind the Septuagint in this place <span class="cmt_word">as</span> the true Daniel. Theodotion, while on the whole agreeing with the text of the Massoretes, is briefer in some respects. There is one addition, the insertion of "magicians" between "wise men and "astrologers. This shows the process of the evolution of the Massoretic text. The Peshitta, though but little, if at all, later than Theodotion, is in yet closer agreement with the text of the Massoretes. Yet the Massoretic text shows certain peculiarities. The presence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span>, in the second personal pronoun, which was disappearing from Targumic, but is regularly found in Daniel, is to be observed. Further, there is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;</span> with the suffix of the first person, which is not Targumic, but is found in the Sindschirli inscription. In the Targums it is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, as in <a href="../../par/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9</a>:34, Onkelos. Eastern Aramaic retained it, as may be seen in the Peshitta Version of the passage before us, and of that to which we have referred. This is another of the many slight indications which all point to the Eastern origin of the Book or' Daniel. It may be observed that we have not here <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">tal'ti</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tal'ta</span>). This is regarded by Behrmann as <span class="accented">status empbaticus.</span> The king in his terror makes appeal <span class="accented">to</span> one who, perhaps, had been dismissed the court on suspicion of being opposed to the new dynasty. That dynasty had displaced and murdered Evil-Merodach, the son of Daniel's old master, and one who had shown himself specially favourable to the Jews. As the text of the Septuagint gives the narrative, we have the king eager to have his terrors laid, and, to lead this opponent, whom his father, if not also Neriglissatr, had displaced, and put in opposition to his rule, to look favourably on him, he mentions the reward he offers.

But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: and he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humblet thine heart, though thou knewest all this; but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, hays drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified.</span> We have gathered these verses together, as they all relate to one matter and come under one con-detonation. Long ago yon Lengerke, and more recently Hitzig, have shown that such an insulting speech as Daniel addressed to Belshazzar would certainly be visited with punishment. The king had no guarantee that the promised interpretation of the writing on the wall would be true, especially when the interpreter had such an animus against him. Then the fact in the twenty-ninth verse, that Daniel received the gifts he had rejected, makes his conduct here all the more extraordinary. A writer of fiction, of even moderate skill, would not make the blunder here made. It could easily be made by a <span class="accented">falsarius</span> interpolating a speech he thought suitable to a Jewish prophet in the presence of a heathen king, who had dishonoured the  sacred vessels by drinking wine in them himself, and his wives, and his concubines. It is to be noted that the princes are omitted from the enumeration here. In proof that our contention is correct, we find the mass of this entirely omitted from the Septuagint. There are signs of confusion, and coalescence of different readings in the text of the Septuagint, yet we have no hesitation in claiming that it represents a much earlier state of the text than we find in our Hebrew Bibles, "Then Daniel stood before the writing, and read, and thus answered the king: This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it was reckoned; it has been removed." The marginal reading which we find in the beginning of this chapter has, <span class="accented">Mane</span>, <span class="accented">Phares</span>, <span class="accented">Thekel.</span> The interpretation here follows a different succession, "And the hand which wrote stood" - a phrase that seems to be a mistaken rendering of the latter clause of the twenty-fourth verse as we find it in the Massoretic text. It seems difficult to imagine what Aramaic word has been translated <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>. Paulus Tel-lensis has  (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5de;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">q'math</span>), which may have been mistaken for <span class="accented">sheliach</span>, though it is not easy to see how. The clause is, at all events, misplaced. The following clause also is misplaced, and is a doublet of the first clause of the twenty-sixth verse. The twenty-third verse seems to be the nucleus of the speech ascribed to Daniel, "O king, thou madest a feast to thy friends, and thou drankest wine, and the vessels of the house of the living God were brought, and ye drank in them, thou and thy nobles, and praised all the idols made with the bands of men, and the living God ye did not bless, and thy breath is in his hand, and he gave thee thy kingdom, and thou didst not bless him, neither praise him." The wives and concubines are not mentioned here. There is no word of the madness of Nebuchadnezzar. Although from the disturbed state of the text in the immediate neighbourhood one is inclined to suspect the authenticity of this twenty-third verse, given in the LXX., yet there is nothing that contradicts the position created by the two early decrees of Nebuchadnezzar, which placed Jehovah the God of the Jews on a par with the great gods of Babylon to whom, though no worship was decreed, at all events no dishonour was to be done. Belshazzar is not so much blamed for praising the gods of wood and stone as for omitting to praise Jehovah. Belshazzar had dishonoured Jehovah, and therefore this ominous message had come forth. The first clause here seems the primitive text. What was more natural than that Daniel, coming into the presence of the king, should go and stand before the mysterious writing, and then, having read it himself, turn to the king and address him? The words of the Massoretic and of the text behind the Septuagint differ very considerably, but not so much but that the former may have grown out of the latter by expansion, and the insertion of paraphrastic additions. A peculiarity to be observed in the Massoretic text (ver. 17) is <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehayvyan</span>), the third plural imperfect of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "to be." It is difficult to understand this form of the third person, save on the supposition that Daniel was written in a region where <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> was the preformative. This preformative along with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;</span> was used in Babylon so late as the period of the Babylonian Talmud. Theodotion and the Peshitta practically agree with the Massoretic text. Even when we omit all the insulting elements, we have Daniel's speech to Belshazzar as we find it in the Massoretic text; no reader can fail to notice the difference of Daniel's demeanour towards Belshazzar as narrated here, from that towards Nebuchadnezzar as narrated in the preceding chapter. When he learns the disaster that impends on the destroyer of his city and the conqueror of his nation, Daniel is astonied and silent, and bursts out from his silence, "The dream be upon thine enemies, and the interpretation thereof upon them that hate thee." He shows no sign of sorrow when he learns the fate impending on Belshazzar. We can understand this, if we regard Daniel's love for the splendid conqueror making him feel the blood of his murdered descendants, Evil-Merodach and Labasi-Marduk called for vengeance. So far as we can make out from external history, Belshazzar was a gallant young prince, who seemed to be able to maintain himself against Cyrus, while his father lived in retirement in Tema; but the judgment of God often falls on those who are not worse than their <span class="accented">predecessors</span>, only guilt has accumulated and ripened. Louis XVI. was not worse than, but really greatly superior to, his two immediate predecessors, yet on him, not on them, broke the vengeance of the French Revolution. There probably was, as said above under ver. 2, a special defiance of Jehovah, which therefore merited special punishment.

As we have seen, the real equivalent of this verse in the Septuagint is a clause in ver. 17, "And the hand which had written (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>) stood." If we take this to mean that the band now "<span class="accented">ceased</span> to write," then the original text might be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, the verb being written <span class="accented">fleaum</span>, in Mandaean manner. Then it would easily  happen that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;</span> (in the older script  and ) was resolved into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;</span> (in the older script  and ). In support of this, it may be observed that while in the fifth verse the older construction of construct state and <span class="accented">status emphalicus</span> is used to exhibit the genitival connection, in the present case the relative <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d9;</span> is used as a sign of the genitive. Starting with this, it is easy to see how the Massoretic text arose; but, on the other hand, it is difficult to see the sense of the reading of the Septuagint, unless this fiery hand is to be imagined as tracing and retracing the characters on the wall of the palace, and that the hand only ceased when Daniel stood before the inscription to read. Thec-dotion differs very little from the Massoretic text, and the Peshitta coincides with it. The word for "writing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">resheem</span>), is really "engraving," and therefore peculiarly descriptive of the Assyrian mode of impressing on clay tablets or incising in stone the thing to be preserved. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-25.htm">Daniel 5:25</a></div><div class="verse">And this <i>is</i> the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians</span>. The Septuagint has two versions of this passage, one m the text, the other in the portion at the beginning, which we think is really composed of marginal readings. In the text the Aramaic is not given at all. As we have already seen, the verse which corresponds to ver. 25 here is really the latter part of ver. 17 of the Septuagint, "This is the writing: It hath been numbered; it is reckoned; it has been carried away." In the verses which are appended to the beginning of the chapter, we have the Aramaic words, but given in a different order, and without the repetition of the first word: "MANE, PHARES, THEKEL. MANE, It has been numbered; PHARES, It is carried away; TnEKEL, It has been set up." Here not only is the order different, but the meaning assigned to <span class="accented">phares</span> is singular. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;</span> means in Syriac, "spread out." It would seem that <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> meant "stretched out" as well as "carried away." It is still more difficult to understand how <span class="accented">thekel </span>can mean "set up," unless the words, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1ff7;</span>, "on the balance," are understood. The Septuagint of the best version is briefer than the Massoretic, though less so than it is in some of the other passages, "Numbered is the time of thy kingdom; ceases thy kingdom; cut short and ended has been thy kingdom; to the Modes and the Persians has it been given." The word interpreted is not repeated as in the Massoretic text, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> is derived from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, which in some of the conjugations means "destroyed," whereas in ver. 17 it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, "it is reckoned," a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e7;&#x5dc;</span> which makes it mean "weigh." The Septuagint rendering of the first clause is an evident attempt at explaining the numbering implied. The Massoretic reading involves a pun in both the last words; there is a play between <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">teqel</span>), "to weigh," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">qelal</span>), "to be light," although the introduction of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5db;&#x5d7;</span> rather conceals this. In the last the play is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5e1;</span>, "to divide," and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5d3;&#x5e1;</span>, "a Persian." Theodotion avoids the repetition of the first word, otherwise he is in somewhat close agreement with the Massoretic text, "MANE, God hath measured thy kingdom; THEKEL, It is set on the balance, and found wanting; PHARES, Thy kingdom is cut asunder, and given to the Medes and the Persians." The Peshitta is in close agreement with the Massoretic  text. The actual meaning of the words, taking them as they appear in the Massoretictext, as Aramaic words, is, to give English equivalents, "a pound, a pound, an ounce, and quarters;" hence the impossibility of interpreting the words. We find all these words, <span class="accented">mena</span>, <span class="accented">teqel</span> (shekel), <span class="accented">pares</span>, in the Ninevite inscriptions. As the words are interpreted, we cannot fail to be impressed with the peremptory style of the inscription, as Hitzig has it. Zockler refers to the sculpturesque style (<span class="accented">lapidarstil</span>). This brevity rendered it difficult for the soothsayers to put any meaning into the words at all. In all the versions the fact that the kingdom is to be given to the Medes and Persians <span class="cmt_word">is</span> emphasized, but, moreover, the play on words in the last clause implies the Persians as the prominent assailants of the Babylonian power, but really that the two powers were united. It seems extraordinary that any one, in the face of this, should maintain that the author of Daniel separated the two powers, and thought the Median power succeeded the Babylonian, and then that the Persian succeeded the Median. We know now that Herodotus's representation of the history of Media and Persia is utterly false and misleading.

The only difference here is that  there is no word of a proclamation. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. We have <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> here instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>. The presence of the haphel form instead of the aphel, is to be noted. No reader whose attention is directed to it can fail to be struck with the magnanimity of Belshazzar; he had promised that whoever would interpret the inscription should be clothed in purple and gold, and be made third ruler of the kingdom. Had he been a mean man, he might have higgled about the matter; he might have declared an uncertainty as to whether Daniel did not, out of his spite against the murderers of the son of Nebuchadnezzar, invent the evil interpretation. The treatment Ahab meted out to Micaiah the son of Imlah sows the way a tyrannical monarch may a-t towards one who has uttered unpalatable prophecies against him. He might, according to the Persian story, have proclaimed Daniel exalted to all the promised honors, and then instantly had him executed. But, no; in noble simplicity he fulfils his promise to the last letter, without any apparent after-thought of vengeance. If Belshazzar is intended to represent Antiochus Epiphanes, certainly the portrait is singularly unlike anything we know of that monarch. Cruel and. treacherous, he was very unlikely to keep such a promise to one who had made such a prophecy concerning him. Even if lie could have done so, no Jew, with blood boiling from the indignities and cruelties heaped upon the Jewish race, could have pictured him doing this. Even the natural instinct that makes us think that specially terrible misfortune must be the result of specially unbroken wickedness, would certainly have led the writer of Daniel, if drawing on his imagination, to make Belshazzar meanly refuse his rewards, or, having given them, to threaten the receiver with death. It is no answer to say, with Ewald and Jephet-ibn-Ali. that the reward once promised was irrevocable, for the accuracy of the reading of the writing might have been contested, and the correctness of the interpretation denied. Further, as has been pointed out by Keil, there is no evidence that Epiphanes ever desecrated the sacred vessels at a banquet; he was regardless enough to have done so, but his financial necessities were too pressing for delaying the coining of these golden treasures. Moreover, in Antiochus such desecration would be without purpose, whereas, as we have seen, there might be a purpose in the action of Belshazzar. The idea maintained by commentators of the critical school, that there in any reference in the description given here of the feast of Belshazzar and its results to the feast which Antiochus gave to the peel,In of Antioch, as described by Polybius, 26, is mere nonsense. The ponts of contrast are vastly more prominent than the points of resemblance. Belshazzar's feast is over in one night; Antiochus's feast lasted several days. Belshazzar's feast was given in his palace, to "a thousand of his lords;" Antiochus invited the whole populace of Antioch to revel in the grove of Daphne. While, as we have seen, there is blasphemy against Jehovah and defiance of him in Belshazzar's feast, there in no kind of debauchery. In regard to the feast of Antiochus, on the other hand, while there is maddest excess of every kind, a very orgy of lust and drunkenness, there is no word, either in Polybius or in the Books of the Maccabees, of any special act of defiance to Jehovah, or blasphemy of his Name. The only point of identity is that both the banquet of Belshazzar and the orgy of Antiochus have been called "feasts." Altogether, the idea that Belshazzar represents Antiochus Epiphanes is nearly as absurd as that Nebuchadnezzar does. Did the orthodox interpretation involve such an identification, what boundless scorn would be poured on the unfortunate maintainers of such a view? 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-30.htm">Daniel 5:30</a></div><div class="verse">In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that night was Belshazzar the King of the Chaldeans slain</span>. The version of the LXX. is here very different, "And the interpretation came upon Belshazzar the king, and the kingdom was taken from the Chaldeans, and given to the Medes and the Persians. There seems no possibility of connecting these two readings so that either should be shown to have come from the other. The Massoretic text, which is here supported by Theodotion and the Peshitta, is the shorter; but in this instance, as neither can have sprung from the other, Brevity has less probative force. If we look at the probability of the situation, we are compelled to accept the Septuagint reading. If the Massoretic reading had been the original, the dramatic completeness of the disaster, following with such rapidity on the back of the prophecy, would certainly have been preserved in every translation. Whereas the desire for this dramatic completeness might lead to the Massoretic verse being fabricated. Further, when we look at the events of the night, it seems impossible to place all of them in the short interval of one night. The feast had begun after sundown, for the lamps were lighted. It had already gone on some time ere Belshazzar thought of the vessels of the house of God. Then, in contempt of Jehovah, the guests sang praises to the gods of Babylon. it is after  all this that the writing appears. There is next the calling of the wise men, who were in the vicinity of the palace. On their failure to explain the writing, the other wise men are summoned by proclamation; they assemble, essay the reading, and fail. The queen-mother comps - either is called, or, hearing the tumult, comes in herself - and tells Belshazzar of Daniel. Daniel is summoned, and reads the writing. Even if we maintain - although it does not seem the natural reading of the passage - that the proclamation of a reward to him who could read the writing followed immediately on the order to call in the astrologers and other wise men, still, it is difficult to imagine all the events, especially the summoning of all the wise men in Babylon by proclamation, and the finding out of Daniel and bringing him to the court, taking place in one night, and that in that very night was Belshazzar slain. On the other hand, the Septuagint makes no such demand on our belief. According to it, the prophecy was not so closely connected with its fulfilment. The feast recorded here may have taken place six, eight, or ten )ears before the actual fall of Babylon. We know that from his seventh year till some time between his eleventh and seventeenth year Nahunahid was in Tema. This feast might be the inauguration of Belshazzar's viceroyalty; in that case it would be nearly ten years before the capture of Babylon by Cyrus. If that is so, the supposed contradiction between this verse and <a href="../../par/daniel/8-1.htm">Daniel 8:1</a> vanishes. We need only look at the various theories of who Belshazzar was. Niebuhr assumes it as a second name for Evil-Merodach - a view for which Keil has some sympathy. Niebuhr ingeniously combines the statement from Berosus, that his reign was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. This, however, might mean a favour for the Jews, shown by the special honour given to Jehoiachin - a thing which would be readily regarded by the Babylonians as "lawless and outrageous." lie maintains that the change of dynasty implied in Babylon was the assumption of the supremacy by Astyages the Mede, who, according to Niebuhr, is Darius the Mede. After one year's personal reign, he placed Neriglissar on the throne. This view is definitely contradicted by the contract tables, which have no reference to a reign between Evil-Merodach and Neriglissar. The other theory is that he is Labasi-Marduk. This view is maintained by Delitzsch and Ebrard. All of them assume the murder of the king the very night of the feast - a thing which is in the teeth of probability, and not supported by the Septuagint reading. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/5-31.htm">Daniel 5:31</a></div><div class="verse">And Darius the Median took the kingdom, <i>being</i> about threescore and two years old.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about three score and two years old</span>. It is probable that the Massoretic division of the chapters here is to be preferred. According to it, this verse is assigned to the begining of the next chapter, but most of the more ancient versions, Theodotion, the Peshitta, and the Vulgate, agree with our English arrangement. The Septuagint, like the Massoretic text, assigns this verse to the sixth chapter. Its rendering manifests several striking peculiarities, "And Artaxerxes of the Medes received (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">the</span> kingdom, and Darius was full of days, and reverend (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) in old age." This is the product of doublets <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;</span>, Artaxerxes, being suggested by some scribe as in his opinion a more probable name than Darius. So the one name begins the first clause, and the other the second. The last clause is evidently due to <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kebar</span>), "about" ("as the son of"), being read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">kaber</span>), "great," "multiplied" - a meaning this word has in Syriac, but not in Chahlee (<a href="../../par/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The uncertainty as to the name has to be noted. We shall reserve for fuller discussion the question of Darius the Mede, only we would say that the name not improbably was modified from a less-known name to one somewhat like it but well known. We know that "<span class="accented">Go-baru</span>," or "<span class="accented">Oybaru"</span> <span class="accented">-</span> "Gobryas," in Greek  - was appointed governor by Cyrus when he conquered Babylon, and that, in the script of the Sindschirli monuments, <span class="accented">Gobryas</span>,  or . is not unlike <span class="accented">Darius</span>. One point to be noted is the fact that the verb used is wrongly translated "took." really means "received." When this is said, we naturally expect some one, either God or man, from whom he has received this honour. If this purported to be a history of Babylonia, then it might be reasoned that the implied source from whom the kingdom was received was God; in such a case <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> would be used of one who succeeded to the kingdom by inheritance; this cannot be the meaning here. In this passage it is merely incidentally mentioned in order to explain the events that immediately follow. The more natural interpretation is that he was put on the throne by another person, his superior. The instance quoted by Professor Bevan, in which this verb is used of the accession of Julian the Apostate, tells really against his contention. Julian expected to have to conquer the empire: but, by the death of his cousin, he received it as an inheritance. Nothing could be more unlike what occurred in  Babylon, according to his theory of what the author of Daniel meant. He maintains that the author of Daniel thought Darius conquered Babylon, and so ascended the throne. The example he brings does not show that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span> could be used in that sense. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/4.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 4"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 4" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/6.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 6"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 6" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/6.htm"><title>Daniel 6 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/6.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/6.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/6-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/5.htm" title="Daniel 5">&#9668;</a> Daniel 6 <a href="../daniel/7.htm" title="Daniel 7">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/6-1.htm">Daniel 6:1</a></div><div class="verse">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-28.</span> - DANIEL IN THE LIONS' DEN. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3</span>. - <span class="cmt_word">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes. which should be over the whole kingdom; and over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</span> The variations from the Massoretic text in the Septuagint are, in regard to the verses before us, very considerable. It assumes the last verse of the preceding chapter, and begins, "And he set up a hundred and twenty and seven satraps over all his kingdom. And over them he set three men as presidents (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>), and Daniel was one of the three men [and had authority over all men in the kingdom. And Daniel was clothed in purple, and was great and honourable (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) before Darius the king, because he was honourable (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and understanding and prudent, and there was an holy spirit in him, and he prospered in the affairs of the kingdom which he did]. Then the king thought (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>) to place Daniel over all his kingdom [(and the two men who stood with him and the hundred and twenty-seven satraps) when the king thought to place Daniel over his whole kingdom]." The passages within brackets, we think, are additions to amplify the description, and to connect it with the honor given Daniel by Belshazzar. The bracketed parts are easily separable from the rest, and then what remains forms a continuous narrative. Theodotion differs, though slightly, from the Massoretic text, Darius "set (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) Daniel over the kingdom" - did not merely take counsel to do it. The Peshitta agrees also very closely with the Massoretic, only the word for "princes" is not, as in the Massoretic text, <span class="accented">ahashdarpnayya</span>, but <span class="accented">rabu heel.</span> This is the common rendering in the Peshitta of this word, and points to the Massoretic term being an adaptation. the use of the word "satrap" here has led to the idea that this is derived from the hundred and twenty-seven provinces (<a href="../../par/esther/1-1.htm">Esther 1:1</a>). This identification is supported certainly by the LXX., which gives a hundred and twenty-seven as the number of the satraps set up by Darius. Josephus, it may be noted ('Ant.,' 10:11.4), mentions the satrapies as three hundred and sixty - a reading that seems scarcely to be drawn by any conceivable mistake from the Massoretie text, nor any tradition of the actual number of satrapis under the Persian rule. The probability is that there has been some early corruption of the number. On the supposition that Darius is Gobryas, these satraps would really be governors of cities and small districts in the populous province of Babylon. We have in the inscriptions of the <span class="accented">Assyrian</span> monarchs who intervened in the affairs of Babylon and Chaldea, notices of a large number of small kingships: each of these would require a special governor. In harmony with this, we are informed by Mr. Pinches that Gobryas appointed subordinate governors in the territory of <span class="cmt_word"></span> Babylon. The phrase which states this occurs in the Annals of Nabunahid (col. 3. line 20), "And Gobryas his governor appointed governors in Babylon." Delitzsch ('Beitrage zur Assyriologie,' 2. p. 256) points out that the sign of the plural after the second occurrence of the word "governor" proves that we cannot translate as if "Cyrus" were the nominative to the sentence, and "Gobryas," who was governor of <span class="accented">Gutium</span> or <span class="accented">Guti</span>, was object. From the fact that the text of Daniel was not protected by being regularly read in the synagogues, as was the Law, the Prophets, the Megilloth, the Psalms, and some other books, it was more at the mercy of scribes. The change of "Gobryas" into "Darius" led easily to other modifications. Probably <span class="accented">medeena</span>, "province," was the word in the original text, but it was modified to <span class="accented">malcoutha</span>, "kingdom," and "governors" of cities became "satraps" over provinces. After having appointed these subordinate governors, that a board of three should be set over them was a necessary arrangement. The name given to them, <span class="accented">sarekeen</span>, is asserted by some to be of Persian origin. On the other hand, the fact that the first syllable is <span class="accented">sar</span>, the Assyrian for "king," one is tempted to think of a Semitic etymology. The Authorized is wrong in making Daniel "first" of these presidents; all that is asserted is that Daniel was one of these presidents. <span class="accented">That the king should have no damage</span> applies most probably to the revenue. The country, in the East, is divided off into small districts for the purpose of tax-collecting, and in the division of the Persian Empire into twenty satrapies, this was greatly the object. The repetition of the word "king" here might imply that Darius was not the king whose loss of revenue was to be guarded against; but we weald not be held as pressing this. Although Daniel was not, on the creation of this board, made chief of it, he soon acquired an influence over Darius which gave him, in effect, such a position. We arc to understand that these officials were mainly Babylonians. We learn now that the capture of Babylonia by Cyrus was not accomplished by a skilful diverting of the waters of the Euphrates, so that the Persian troops were enabled to wade in by the bed of the stream, nor to the fact that in the revelry of a feast the river-gates were left open, and the sentinels were careless; but to the fact that the whole official class were at enmity with the court, and so treachery opened the gates to Gobryas, the governor of Gutium, the name given to Mesopotamia as a Persian province, and when morning broke one day, the sixteenth of Tammuz, the inhabitants of Babylon saw the shields of Gutium guarding the citadel and the temple Esakkil. This being the case. naturally the official class of the former monarchy would be largely drawn upon to supply the needs of the new government; naturally the native Babylonians would think that the preference in all matters of office ought to be given to them; that, above all, the principal place should not be given to a Jew by Cyrus, or by any one under him, since Cyrus professed to be moved by reverence for the national gods of Babylon in his war against Nabunahid. <span class="accented">And the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</span> This really means over the province of Babylon, <span class="accented">malcoutha</span> being written instead of <span class="accented">medeena.</span> His object was not to make Daniel satrap instead of himself, but to make him his "vizier." His knowledge of the <span class="accented">business</span> of the province would of necessity be very thorough, dating, as it did, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar. He, as no other, would be acquainted with the various religious beliefs of the different captive communities in Babylonia. Himself belonging to one of these communities, his interest would be excited by all in similar circumstances. His age, the dignity he had enjoyed in the courts of Nebuchadnezzar and Nabunahid, along with his zeal and ability, naturally explain the desire of Darius (Gobryas) to make him his vizier.

There are elements here of interpolation and of the coalescence of different renderings. It is difficult to understand how "the presidents" could be called <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>. There seems no Aramaic word with that meaning, into which <span class="accented">sarekeen</span> could be read; certainly  it is as difficult to imagine any one thinking of introducing that as a logical equivalent. Young men would not be put in such a responsible place, nor would they have thought of Daniel - a man of about eighty years - as a colleague with youths. There are evident traces of two readings having coalesced; thus we have <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> followed by <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, after the course of the narrative has been interrupted by an inserted clause. As to the punishment to befall the <span class="accented">transgressor</span> of this decree, one statement is, "If not, he shall die" The next version of the punishment is brought into connection with the humiliation to be inflicted on Daniel, that "he may be cast into the den of lions." At the same time, the fact that we hear of the decree in connection with the consultation of these conspirators in the present text, is in harmony with what we find in the fourth chapter. In the original document not improbably the statement would be given - as in <a href="../../par/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>. in regard to Pharaoh's dreams - alike when the conspirators devise the plan, and when they carry it out. In regard to some of the differences, an explanation may be hazarded, but we will not delay. Notwithstanding that the Massoretic here is shorter than the Greek text, we fancy it is not difficult through it to find a shorter text still. The text of Theodotion is much briefer than either of the other texts, "And the presidents (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>) and the satraps sought to find occasion against Daniel, and they found neither occasion, nor fault, nor error against him, because he was faithful. And the presidents said, We shall not find occasion against Daniel except in regard to precepts (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>) of his God." The Peshitta agrees in the main with the Massoretic. It makes Daniel faithful "towards God." That these co-presidents and the under-governors should be indignant that a Jew, who had actually been employed in the court of Nabunahid, should be put above those Babylonians who had admitted the shields of Guti into Esakkil, was natural. Of course, they could not seriously plead this before the governor Gobryas. They could not accuse Daniel directly of worshipping his national Deity, for the Persian rule in:Babylon, while zealous for the gods of Babylon, did not imply any assault on the deities of other subject races. It is to be noted that in the Septuagint the plot is concoeted by the two "youths," Daniel's co-presidents. They, most likely men of high rank, would feel most keenly that they were superseded by a Jew, and their feelings would naturally spread to those beneath them.

All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not, Wherefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree</span>. The Septuagint, in regard to those verses, is much briefer, and reveals a better text. "Then those men came and said before the king, We have made a decree and a statute, that any man who offereth prayer or presents petition to any god for the space of thirty days, save only to Darius the king, shall be cast into the den of lions; and thus Darius decreed, and confirmed it." The fact that requests to uther men are not forbidden is to be observed. The long catalogue of officials is omitted; the whole conspiracy is the work of Daniel's co-presidents. Theodotion and the Peshitta are in practical agreement with the Massoretic text. To understand the point of this decree, that seems to us so absurd, and comprehend how any one with sufficient mental vigour left to be placed by Cyrus as governor in Babylon could be led to yield to confirm it, we must recognize the state of matters in Babylon. During the reign of Nabunahid there had been many religious changes. The seclusion of the monarch had led to the neglect of many of the regular rites of the gods of Babil. The policy he pursued of bringing the gods of various provinces to Babylon tended, as did the similar policy in Rome, to draw off from the importance of the national religion by forming rival cults. One of the first acts of Cyrus's reign was to order the replacing of these deities in their ancient shrines. This would necessarily be most distasteful to the worshippers of these imported deities. There would be much murmuring among the huge heterogeneous population; and there would be thus a well-grounded fear of a religious riot. A bold soldier as Gobryas (Darius) was, he probably was but a timid ruler, and nothing would he dread more than a religious riot. Would it not be a plausible way of meeting this difficulty to order for one month all worship to cease? The British Government in India regulates the religion of the inhabitants as summarily, forbidding religious observances that are liable to cause excitement in votaries of rival creeds. Thus Moses assigned, as a reason for refusing to sacrifice in Egypt, the wrath of the  Egyptians (<a href="../../par/exodus/8-26.htm">Exodus 8:26</a>). The offering of a prayer among heathen peoples generally meant the offering of sacrifices, also accompanied possibly by processions. That the decree was made by Darius in the absence of his favourite minister might have two reasons: either from the fact that the word used (<span class="accented">hargishoo</span>) <span class="accented">implies</span> that the presidents rushed in tumultuously into the royal presence; that there was an emergency which must be met by instant action; or that, being a weak man, he did not wish his other counsellors to think that he was so under the influence of this Jew that he could do nothing without first consulting him; so, by way of showing his independence, he signed the decree. As for the practical deification of himself required from the subject <span class="accented">races</span>, that would not appear to him a matter of importance. It might even seem to him as the surest way of doing away with the rancour of religious rivalries to give these conflicting creeds a common object. He, Gobryas, was the representative of Cyrus, in whom deity was incarnate, therefore let them worship him in his representative capacity. That Daniel should be affected by this decree might easily never occur to Gobryas Jewish worship, now that the temple at Jerusalem was in ruins, must have become very much the synagogue worship of the present day. A worship that had neither idols nor sacrifices, neither temple nor altar, would seem to the Babylonians, and for that matter to the Medians and Persians also, as much the same as atheism. Christianity seemed so to the Roman Government. Darius, then, would readily think that Daniel could make no serious objection to this order That Daniel always spoke of a God in heaven did not matter much, since, to all appearance, he never worshipped him. Some have maintained that the punishment was an impossible one. It is certain that Asshur-bani-pal inflicted a similar punishment on Saulmugina, a rebel King of Babylon, and did it in honour of the gods. The main objection has been urged from the mistaken assumption that the text implies that the lions' den was a bottle shaped dungeon. There is nothing in the narrative that necessitates this. In regard to the decree, there is reference to the "laws of the Medea and Persians," "the Medea" being placed first. It has been attributed to court flattery, as Darius was a Merle; probably, however, there may be another explanation. The small canton of Ansan, over which Cyrus was king, lay between Elam and Media, but belonged more to the former than to the latter of these countries. Both countries bad been overrun by a nomadic race, the Manda, under Astyages, who had overthrown Cyaxarcs the King of Media. Against Astyages Cyrus rebelled, and gathered to him the Medea, Elamites, and other cognate races. Dr. Winckler thinks that, on his victory over Astyages, Cyrus assumed the name Persian, <span class="accented">Parsu</span>, from his race. The name <span class="accented">Parsua</span> appears in connection with the Medea in an inscription of Shalmaneser, where it seems to indicate a small kingdom occupying much the <span class="accented">same</span> geographical posit;on as Ansan. By taking this old name, not impossibly Cyrus avoided making the Medea feel themselves subject to the Elamites, or the Elamites to the Medea, or either to the little kingdom of Ansan. The Median had comparatively recently been an imperial power, therefore its laws and constitution would be placed before the more recently prominent Persian. One thing that must be observed is that, while the writer of Daniel mentions Medea separate from Persians, he mentions them conjointly. Had the writer been under the delusion attributed to him by all critical interpreters, that the Median Empire came between the Babylonian and the Persian, he would not have represented the Median courtiers as saying anything about the Persians or their laws; the Medes, and the Medea alone, would be considered. According to the Greek account, from which it is alleged Daniel drew his information, Persia was a small, undeveloped country before Cyrus raised it to empire. What right, then, would it have to have its laws mentioned in the same breath with those of imperial Media? If, however, Cyrus had been raised to such power, so as to be able to encounter successfully Astyages and his Scythian hordes by the adhesion to his cause of the Medea, the laws of the Medea might well get a preference, as the Medea were, in all probability, more numerous than the Persians, though the laws of the Persians would be mentioned. The claim that these laws were immutable must be regarded as on a par with several other Eastern exaggerations. <span class="accented">Signed the writing and the decree.</span> The reading of the Septuagint seems superior, "And <span class="accented">so</span> King Darius decreed (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>), and confirmed it." At the same time, the verb <span class="accented">resham</span>, translated "<span class="accented">sign</span>," really means "<span class="accented">engrave</span>," and therefore might naturally enough be used for affixing a seal to a clay tablet; only <span class="accented">hetham</span> is the word usually used for "sealing" a document. Behrmann thinks it does not refer to the signature of the sovereign, but  to the engraving the decree on the clay. If we imagine <span class="accented">yeqeem</span> to have fallen out before "<span class="accented">sara</span>, we have a reading not unlike the LXX. In the seventh verse there is a list of officials omitted from the Septuagint; it is almost identical in members with that which we find in ch. 3, but in a slightly different order, only the <span class="accented">sareqeen are</span> added and the <span class="accented">edargazereen</span> omitted.

The Septuagint rendering differs only slightly from the Massoretic. "And when Daniel knew the decree which was passed (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) against him, he opened the windows of his upper chamber, and fell on his face three times a day, according as he did aforctimc, and prayed." The Septuagint translator read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>, "against him," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, "went." It seems to us that the Massoretic reading, "went to his house," is an addition due to misreading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5d4;</span>. That the variations of the Septuagint arc not due to paraphrase is proved by the tact that the next clause is literally translated. It would seem that the text before the LXX. had been altered, so that we have "fell upon his face," instead of "knelt upon his knees." The former phrase is an echo from <a href="../../par/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>. It is to be observed that "prayed and gave thanks" is omitted from the Septuagint. As the omission can have no purpose, and we can understand the reason of the words being added, we prefer the LXX. reading here. Theodotion and the Peshitta are at one with the Massoretic. The action of Daniel is here that of a man of true conscientiousness; he does not obtrude his religion now that the practice of it implies danger, as did some Christian fanatics in the persecution of the three first centuries; nor, on the other hand, does he hide his acts of worship - he simply continued his previous habits. Had a Jewish fanatic of the time of the Maccabees written this, the action attributed to Daniel would have been much more uncompromising, as the story in the Midrash Rabba of Moses in regard to the crown of Pharaoh. Or Daniel would be represented as doing, as the Jews arc said in Third Maccabees to have done to Ptolemy, bowing himself down in humble abasement before the king, to get him to reverse his decree, or, if not, to devise some means of its effect being averted. Daniel does none of these things. <span class="accented">His windows being open toward Jerusalem.</span> The windows were lattices, and as the room was an upper one on the roof of the house, the opening of the windows enabled everything done in the apartment to be seen. The practice of prayer "toward Jerusalem" is acknowledged to have arisen in Babylon during the Captivity. Solomon, in his prayer at the dedication of the temple, refers to the contingency of captivity (<a href="../../par/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a>), and prays that if the captives "pray unto thee toward their land, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy Name, then hear thou their prayer" (see also <a href="../../par/psalms/5-8.htm">Psalm 5:8</a> [7]). The practice of praying towards a particular point has been maintained by the Mohammedans, who pray towards Mecca. Mohammed originally made Jerusalem the <span class="accented">qiblah</span>, or point of prayer; but the Jews would not receive him as their Messiah, and so from Jerusalem it was changed to Mecca. The objection of Bertholdt hardly needs to be mentioned, that "the temple was in ruins" - the place was holy ground. "Three times a day" is referred to <a href="../../par/psalms/55-18.htm">Psalm 55:18</a> (17), "Evening and morning and at noonday will I complain."

The Septuagint reading is very different, "And they watched Daniel, and found him praying three times a day every day." It is difficult to decide which is the preferable reading, and almost as difficult to deduce the one reading from the other. Thcodotion has a reading akin to that of the Septuagint, "Then those men watched, and found Daniel praying, and. making entreaty to his God." This is akin to the Septuagint at the beginning, but is close to the Massoretic at the end. The Peshitta is in close agreement with Theodotion. It seems more in accordance with the plan of these presidents that they should not, as the Massoretic text asserts, rush tumultuously into the house of Daniel, but rather, as the three versions represent them doing, setting a watch, and then, when information reached them of Daniel's habits, acting accordingly. Nothing in the narrative makes it probable that there was a general assembling of the governors against Daniel; it was the action of his colleagues in the presidency.

Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him</span>. The version of the Septuagint, as usual, differs from the Massoretic text," Then these men interceded (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) with the king, and said, King Darius, didst thou not confirm a decree that no man should offer prayer or present petition to any god for thirty days, save only to thee, O king, otherwise he should be cast into the den of lions?

And they said, Behold, we found Daniel, thy friend, praying, and making entreaty before his God three times a day. [And the king, being grieved, spake to cast Daniel into the den of lions, according to the decree which he decreed against him.] Then the king grieved exceedingly concerning Daniel, and laboured (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) till the going down of the sun to deliver him out of the hands of the satraps." One of the verses here seems to have been an addition most probably to the Aramaic text, as the Semitic spirit and construction shine through. There is, further, an obvious instance of doublet; the clause within square brackets has all the appearance of being a marginal note summarizing the contents of the verse. The words, "out of the hands of the satraps," have been added as explanatory. Theodotion is in practical agreement with the Massoretictext. The Peshitta differs in some minor points, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> inserting the common Eastern mode of addressing royalty, "O king, live for ever." The clause, "concerning the decree," is omitted; the other differences are unimportant. The fact that his Jewish origin is put in the front of their accusation of him indicates what Daniel's great offence was. The Septuagint places the fact that he was the king's friend in that position. It seems little likely that even to a satrap would any courtier venture to bring forward a taunting reference to his friendships. The king is caught in a trap; but no courtier would venture to press his advantage, lest he himself be taken at unawares. Darius's efforts to save Daniel are to be noted. His effort would most probably be directed to find some way out of the constitutional dilemma into which he had been entrapped. His subordinate position, occupying the place of King of Babylon merely for a season instead of Cyrus, would make it more difficult for him to override any constitutional maxim. In the Septuagint the presidents seem to compel the king by moral arguments - a thing float seems possible, though also a feature that might very naturally be added to the story. In the Massoretic text there is an endeavor to poison the king against Daniel. Daniel has despised the king and his commandment. This is more natural than the conduct imputed to the presidents in the Septuagint. These efforts were not successful, as probably they scarcely expected they would be; the king is convinced of his own hastiness, and of their treachery also, but not of any failure on the part of Daniel, in due respect to him, as the representative of the great king.

Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree or statute which the king establisheth maybe changed</span>. The corresponding verse in the Septuagint is much shorter, "And he was not able to deliver him from them." This verse in the Massoretic text has very much the appearance of a doublet mollified to fit a new position. The first clause has occurred already twice before in the sixth verse and the fifteenth. The last portion of the verse is a modification of what is stated in vers. 9 and 13. The first clause is omitted by Theodotion, but inserted by the Peshitta. The probability is that this verse, in its Massoretic form, has been inserted to explain the opposition the king strove in vain to overcome. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast <i>him</i> into the den of lions. <i>Now</i> the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee.</span> The Septuagint Version here is not so likely to represent the original text, as there are symptoms of displacement, "Then Darius the king called out and said to Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually three times a day, he will deliver thee out of the power of the lions; till the morning be of good cheer." The opening clause of the next verse in the Septuagint really represents the first clause of the verse before us, "And the king was grieved, and spake to cast Daniel into the den of lions." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The circumstances cannot fail to remind the reader of Herod with John the Baptist, and the still greater crime wrought by weakness - Pilate and our Lord. Darius had failed to overbear the  opposition of the legalists who had determined on Daniel's death; he is obliged, therefore, to give the order that the sentence be executed. In doing so he commends his friend to the God, or the gods, if we take the K'thib instead of the Q'ri. Darius probably knew nothing of Daniel's religious beliefs, and therefore would be prone to imagine that he worshipped several gods, and to them he commends him. The addition of the Septuagint is picturesque, "Be of good cheer until the morning." Moreover, it fits in to what follows, and at the same time it is not of such a nature as that it should suggest itself to the ordinary interpolator. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/6-17.htm">Daniel 6:17</a></div><div class="verse">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel</span>. The Septuagint text begins, according to Tischendorf, with a passage elsewhere considered, "And the king was grieved, and commanded to cast Daniel into the den of lions, according to the decree which he had made concerning him." This is repeated from the fourteenth verse, where it appears alike in the Chisian Manuscript and in the version of Paul of Tella, "Then Daniel was cast into the den of lions, and a stone was brought and placed at the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signets of his lords, in order that Daniel might not be raised by them or delivered by the king out of the den." The reason assigned for the double sealing of the stone, while a very probable one, is from its very probability to be suspected; it is most likely an explanatory marginal remark, that has slipped into the text. It will be observed that the clause with which the Septuagint Version of this verse begins is the equivalent of the opening clause of the preceding verse. Theodotion's rendering does not differ from the Massoretic reading. From the similarity of the dialects, the resemblance of the Peshitta to the Massoretic is even closer. There are few criticisms of Daniel more unfair than that founded on the assumption that the writer had a bottle-shaped dungeon in his mind, that might be covered over as a well by one large stone. Nothing in the words used implies this. While gob certainly means a "pit" or a "cistern," it was by no means necessarily of small size or covered over with one stone, so that within it would be darkness. There were probably walls rising from the sides of the pit which formed the den; in that wall there would be naturally an aperture through which food could be passed to the lions. Through this door was Daniel cast, and when he had been so cast in, a stone was rolled up to the aperture and sealed. There is no necessity for arguing, as Hitzig and von Lengerke do, against this incident. The passage the former refers to in Xenophon's 'Anabasis' (v. 5.25) applies to dwellings of human beings, and even if we could transfer its description to the present case, it would not damage our argument. In these dwellings Xenophon tells us "were goats, sheep, oxen, birds, and their young; all the cattle are fed within with green fodder." These critics forget that lions' dens were in use not only among the Assyrians and Babylonians, but also among the Greek monarchs, and so, even if the writer was of the late date attributed to him by critics, still he would not speak nonsense about what he could not fail to know something. Hitzig sees in Daniel being let down into the den of lions an imitation of what befell Joseph at the hands of his brethren. Certainly the same word is used in the Targum of Onkelos, <a href="../../par/genesis/37-22.htm">Genesis 37:22</a>, but identity of name does not prove identity of thing. No one could argue that the pit of a theatre was necessarily dark, dirty, and damp, because a coal-pit is. That Reuben persuaded his brethren to put Joseph in the pit in order to save him alive, and the rulers had Daniel put in the lions' den in order to destroy him, is nothing to the purpose, it would seem; that there were lions in the pit or den in which Daniel was placed, and no venomous beast in that into which Joseph was let down, is also of no moment. The further fact that this letting down into the pit occurs in the beginning of Joseph's career, and in Daniel's case it is near the end of a long and prosperous life, is not noticed. The life of Daniel must be proved to be written in imitation of the life of Joseph, so any means are good enough to secure this predetermined conclusion. While this resemblance is only superficial, there is another resemblance that is, at all events, full of interest. In later history there was another sealing of the stone that was rolled to the mouth of a grave - it may be noted that <span class="accented">gob</span> is used for a "grave" also - and fear here also was lest the innocently condemned might be taken away. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/6-18.htm">Daniel 6:18</a></div><div class="verse">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the king went to his palace. and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</span> In the Massoretic text one of the clauses, "Neither were instruments of music brought before him," has caused great difficulty. The word <span class="accented">dahvan</span>, translated "instruments of music," is rendered by Furst, "dancing-girl; "Gesenius, "concubine; "Rosenmuller  renders, "odours." The Mediaeval Greek Version translates, "instruments of music." Furst speaks with favour of the Syriac rendering, "food-tables." <span class="accented">Han'ayl</span>, the aphel of '<span class="accented">eilal</span>, has to be noted as a sign of antiquity. The version of the Septuagint is very wide from the Massoretic in the latter part of the verse, "Thus the king returned to his palace, and went to bed fasting, being grieved about Daniel." It is evident that the Septuagint translator had before him <span class="accented">deheel</span> instead of <span class="accented">dohvan</span> - <span class="accented">nun</span> in the script of Egyptian Aramaic is very like <span class="accented">lamed</span> in the later mode writing, as also <span class="accented">yodh</span> and <span class="accented">vav</span>. It is possible that the name "Daniel" was read <span class="accented">han'eel or</span>, <span class="accented">vies versa</span>, as two of the letters are identical If we can accept the Septuagint reading, the difficulty of this mysterious <span class="accented">dahoun</span> disappears. Another clause is added here in the Septuagint from ver. 22 (23) Massoretic, though with variations. "Then the God of Daniel, taking thought for him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>) closed the mouths of the lions, that they did not hurt Daniel." This statement is not inserted in Daniel's answer to the king in the Septuagint, as it is in the Massoretic text. It would almost seem that our present text in both cases is a condensation of a more extended document. This view receives support from the rendering of Theodotion, "And the king departed to his house, and went to bed supperless, and viands were not brought to him, and his sleep went from him, and God closed the mouths of the lions, and they did not hurt Daniel." It will be seen that the last clause here agrees with the concluding clause of the Septuagint. The mysterious word <span class="accented">dahvan is</span> rendered here "food" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) - a version that is suspicious from the fact that it merely repeats, under another form, the statement that the king went to bed fasting. It is supported by the Peshitta and the Vulgate. This difference can scarcely be due to a various reading. Otherwise the Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic text. The king's sorrow and humiliation could not be better pictured than it is here: even the feast of the palace had no pleasure for him, he was so grieved about Daniel. But we must also bear in mind that fasting had among the Jews, and, indeed, in the East generally, a relationship to prayer (see <a href="../../par/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>, where fasting takes the place of prayer; see also <a href="../../par/daniel/10-3.htm">Daniel 10:3</a>). It means also repentance (<a href="../../par/jonah/3-6.htm">Jonah 3:6-8</a>). Darius, then, repented his hasty decree, and prayed for the deliverance of Daniel.

The word used occurs in the Targums. It may, however, be doubted whether the word here is not the Syriac <span class="accented">shapbra.</span> The writing here presents so many peculiarities that suspicion is forced upon the reader. The first <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;</span> is small, and the second is large. There is the further difficulty that <span class="accented">nogah is</span> nearly equivalent to <span class="accented">shaphra.</span> One might suspect a doublet, as Behrmann maintains, here, did not the versions indicate something like this as the meaning of this clause. <span class="accented">A lamentable voice</span> (<span class="accented">atzeeb</span>) seems to mean "sad" or "grieved." The version of the Septuagint shows traces of addition, "And King Darius rose early in the morning, and took with him the satraps, and went and stood at the mouth of the den of lions. Then the king called to Daniel with a loud voice, with weeping, saying, O Daniel, if thou art alive, and thy God whom thou servest continually, hath he saved thee from the lions? and have they not harmed thee?" It is possible the addition of "the satraps" may have been due to <span class="accented">shapharpara</span> being read <span class="accented">ahashdarpnayya.</span> Certainly if the purpose of the double scaling was what it is assigned to be in the first verse, then the satraps would accompany him; only the suggestion is such a natural one that it might readily slip into the text. Ver. 20 (21) in the LXX. has traces of expansion. The omission of <span class="accented">yekeel</span> and the change of <span class="accented">sheezab</span> to the finite preterite is possible enough, and may indicate that in the original text the word rendered "able" was not found. Theodotion renders ver. 19 (20) in accordance with the Massoretic reading, but, in ver. 20 (21) instead of "lamentable voice," has "strong voice," a reading that seems somewhat confirmed by the LXX. Further, he translates the interrogative <span class="accented">ha</span> as if it were the Hebrew <span class="accented">kee</span>, "if." The Peshitta, though agreeing in the nineteenth verse with the Massoretic, has some minor differences in the following verse - "high voice" instead of "lamentable voice," and "faithfully" instead of "continually." The Vulgate singularly inserts in ver. 20 <span class="accented">putasne</span>? "dost thou think?" That Darius should thus  hasten in the semi-darkness of the first glimmer of dawn to the lions' den to see whether Daniel were yet alive, was but natural. As the sealing of the lions' den suggested the sealing of the holy sepulchre, so the hastening of Darius to the den in the earliest dawn suggests the action of the women who got up "a great while before day." When Darius calls Daniel the "servant of the living God," there is no necessary confession of faith in him on the part of the king. It is for him simply an act of politeness to a Deity who, if this were neglected, might resent. It is to be noted that this attribute "living" is omitted in the Septuagint.

My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt</span>. The Syriac construction, <span class="accented">malleel</span> 'ira, is to be observed. The rendering of the LXX. differs from the Massoretic text in a way that can scarcely be due to differences merely of reading, "Then Daniel called with a loud voice and said O king, I am yet living, and God hath saved me from the lions according to the righteousness found in me before him, and before thee, O king, was neither ignorance nor sin to be found in me; but thou didst hearken to men who deceive kings, and hast east me into the den of lions for my destruction." It is not impossible that the opening clauses of the Massoretic and the LXX. respectively, "O king, I am yet living." and "O king, live for ever," have been derived from the same source. The last clause is to all appearance an expansion. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. Daniel answers the king, and declares his safety. The angelology of Daniel is an interesting subject, but here the question is complicated by the fact that there is no reference to angelic interference in the Septuagint. Still all through Scripture God does most of his works through the intervention of angels. To Darius, if he had any such beliefs as afterwards are found associated with Zoru astrianism, the ascription of deliverance to an angel would be natural enough. It is doubt ful whether Cyrus and his followers were not idolaters. The rebuke implied in the state merit that not only before God was Daniel innocent, but in the sight of the king, is sufficiently clear without passing beyond the lines of courtly decorum. The expansion in the LXX. is unnecessary, and mars the stately picture; though, on the other hand, the simple answer to the king's question is more likely than the courtly "O king live for ever."

The verse that occupies the same place in the Septuagint is not a translation of the present verse at all, but looks as if it had been a sentence in the original longer documents which followed the above Massoretic verse, "Then all the powers gathered together, and saw Daniel, that the lions had not hurt him." It is barely possible float the first clause here represents Aramaic text that might be misread into the Massoretic text. Although it is supported by the later versions, the Massoretic text has a <span class="accented">suspicions</span> appearance. The last clause is a moral reflection, unlike anything else in the Book of Daniel, and is omitted, as we saw, from the Septuagint. The assertion of the king's gladness, too, differs in colour from the other statements in the book; thus compare the language concerning Nebuchadnezzar when the three Hebrew youths were delivered from the fiery furnace. At the same time, it is to be observed that the use of the hophal form in the verb <span class="accented">hoosaq</span> is an evidence of the antiquity of this portion of the verse. The hypothesis that tins narrative has been condensed from a longer one, has much to support it. The lesson inculcated, that faith in God would result in deliverance, is very true, even though it was not in the text. The irregular form of the adjective <span class="accented">t'ayb</span> points out a possibility that there has been some modification of the text. Sometimes words not understood have resulted in known words being written in an irregular way.

In this account of the punishment meted out to the accusers of Daniel, the victims are only two, with their wives and children. Hitzig contemptuously remarks that the lions' den must have been large to contain a hundred and twenty-two men along with their families - that number he gets by adding to the governors of the provinces the two presidents,colleagues of Daniel. If, however, we assume the Septuagint text to be correct, then this objection falls to the ground. The phrase  "or ever they came at the bottom of the den," is an intensification of the narrative. In the Massoretic text it is "all their bones;" in the LXX. it is simply "their bones." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The slaughter of the wives and children of offenders, with the guilty persons themselves, was the common practice. There are two other accounts of this event - one preserved in the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon, and the other in the pages of Josephus. According to the story of Bel and the Dragon, the king, who thus condemns Daniel, is no less a person than Cyrus the great conqueror. The reason of the condemnation is not a decree forbidding all worship, but because Daniel had laid bare the deceit of the priests of Bel, and killed the sacred dragon, the people of Babylon were incensed, and threatened Cyrus that they would burn his house if he did not deliver Daniel into their hands to be cast into the lions' den. The seven lions were starved in order that they might be sure to devour Daniel. For six days he was there in the den. In order that Daniel might not starve, whatever befell the lions, Habacuc was brought from Judaea, carried by the hair of his head, to feed the prophet. The destruction of Daniel's accusers is stated in a mere compendious fashion. The fact that this version is referred to by Irenaeus ('Adv. Haeres.,' 4.), Tertullian ('De Jejuniis,' 7.), and Clement of Alexandria ('Strom.,' 1. p. 329, Morel), shows that early in the second century this narrative was incorporated with the canonical Daniel. This makes it almost necessarily before Christ in the date of its origin. If so, it is difficult to imagine the canonical version to be only a century and a half older. Josephus shows no signs that he knew of this apocryphal addition, but adds a feature for himself, "The enemies of Daniel, when they saw that nothing evil had befallen him, unwilling to attribute his deliverance to Deity and his providence, declared that the lions had been filled with food, and therefore neither attacked Daniel nor approached him, and maintained this to the king. But he, hating their malice, ordered that much flesh be thrown to the lions, and when they had gorged themselves, that the enemies of Daniel be cast into the den, in order that he might learn whether the lions would spare them on account of their being satisfied. It was then manifest to Darius, when the satraps had been thrown in, that Daniel had been preserved by miracle, for the lions spared none of them, but tore them all to pieces as if they had been famishing."

He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</span> This decree has a resemblance to the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar. In the Septuagint there is less magniloquence, though the divergence is too great to be the result merely of difference of reading, "<span class="accented">Then</span> Darius wrote to all nations and tongues and countries dwelling in all his land, saying, Let all men who are in my kingdom stand and worship, and serve the God of Daniel, for he alone abideth, and liveth to generations of generations for ever. I Darius will worship and serve him all my days, for none of the idols that are made with hands are able to deliver as the God of Daniel did Daniel." It is to be observed that it is only to the inhabitants of his own land that Darius writes, and further, it is "all men in his kingdom" he commands, not "every dominion in his kingdom." There is no notice taken of the kingdom of God; it is God himself who liveth and abideth for ever. The last verse, again, in the Septuagint, in which Darius professes his faith in Jehovah, is evidently spurious. Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. Removing the exaggerations from it, the decree of Darius does not mean any more than we found in the decrees of Nebuchadnezzar; it is simply a warning against showing any disrespect to a Deity with such formidable powers as Jehovah. It may be regarded as connected with the dualistic view of the universe maintained by Zoroastrianism, that deliverance from lions is spoken of with such awe. The lion was one of the beasts specially representative of the evil principle, as we see in Persepolis. There was thus evidence given that the God of the Jews was supreme over the powers of evil; therefore, without forbidding any subject of Babylonia from worshipping his own ancestral divinity. Darius yet commanded him, in so doing, to watch his conduct, so that nothing disrespectful to the powerful God of the Hebrews should be done by him.

The Septuagint follows a different reading, "And King Darius was gathered to his generation. And Daniel was established in the reign of Darius, and Cyrus the Persian inherited the kingdom"  - a reading due to the influence of Xenophon's  'Cyropaedia.' Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text. The statement that Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius and in the reign of Cyrus, does not necessarily imply that they were successive. The reign of Gobryas, a satrap, and perhaps in some way "King of Babylon," would coincide with the reign of Cyrus as "king of nations." Moreover, if Darius (Gobryas) was King of Babylon for two years, then Cyrus would succeed him in this position. Certainly in some of the earlier contract tables of his reign, Cyrus in not called "King of Babil." <span class="accented">Excursus on Darius the Mode.</span> There is no character in Scripture who has given rise to more hypotheses than Darius the Mode. Every person whose name has come into prominence in early Persian history may be said to have been pressed into service. The apocryphal addition to Daniel - Bel and the Dragon - identifies Darius the Mede with Cyrus. Josephus implies that Darius is Cyaxares II., as he declares him to be a relative (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>) of Cyrus and son of Astyages. Eusebius ('Chronicon' ad Olym., 54) identifies him with Astyages. Later critical commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bevan, have assumed that Darius Hystaspis is intended. Still more recently, by Mr. Pinches, it has been suggested that Gobryas (Gobaru), who took possession of Babylon on behalf of Cyrus is Darius the Mede. As a preliminary to discussing the question, we must look at what is said about Darius the Mede in Daniel. He received the kingdom when he was sixty-two years of age. He was the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes. From the fact that only the "first" year of his reign is mentioned, we may deduce that he reigned little more than a year. He appears in the Massoretic text especially as a supreme monarch, who appoints governors under him. We must, however, bear in mind the fact that the evidence from the Book of Daniel is complicated by the proofs of expansion which we find in it. Even when the Septuagint Version coincides with the Massoretic recension, we are not even then quite sure that the work of modification had not begun before the two families of recension were established. Bearing this in mind, let us gather up the information we have concerning Darius here. He is asserted to be an old man when he "received the kingdom." The verb used here is used of legitimate succession; thus in Paulus Tellensis Cyrus is said "to receive," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;</span>, the kingdom on the death of Darius. From the connection this is out of the question. It must mean that from some higher power he "received" his appointment. His age we may assume to be correctly stated, notwithstanding the Septuagint rendering; this seems to have been drawn from the Massoretic reading by taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> is a Syriac sense. This view is confirmed by the fact that the resulting construction is not a natural one. Further, the exactitude of statement gives a presumption of truth, as there is no reason in the narrative why this age should be taken and not another. We are not necessitated to maintain that the governors were satraps in the large sense of the word. The fact that "satraps" were Persian governors would lead that word to be inserted. As to the name, we cannot lay much stress on this, as variation in the matter of names is not uncommon in Hebrew literature, a less common name being replaced by one better known. This is rendered the more likely as in the Septuagint the name Darius is replaced by Artaxerxes in one instance. If we take the Septuagint text, there is nothing that necessitates anything more than that the province of which he might be the governor was affected by his appointing these so-called "satraps." As to the title "king," we must remember that that title was used very loosely. Cyrus claims to have several ancestors who were "great kings" (Cylinder). Darius Hystaspis declares eight of his ancestors to have been "kings." Ansan, of which Cyrus and his ancestors were kings, was a canton under the power of Elam, and Hystaspes remained satrap under his son. Let us now investigate the various hypotheses that have been brought forward, and we shall take them in order of their probable age. The first hypothesis is that Darius is Cyrus. This we find, as we have said, in the second apocryphal addition to Daniel  - Bel and the Dragon - as we find it in Theodotion. So far as the letters are concerned, it is not an impossible thing to fancy that <span class="accented">Ko'resh</span> was read into <span class="accented">Daravasb</span>, the resh and the <span class="accented">shin</span> being present in both words in the same position, and in the Aramaic characters of  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span> <span class="accented">daleth</span> and <span class="accented">caph</span> were like. There is hardly any reason to lead one to read more readily the one name than the other. Although Darius could not fail to be a well-known name among the Jews, since three of that name successively reigned over the Persian Empire, and still in the East, Dara (Darius) is a name synonymous with "magnificence:" yet to a Jew what monarch of Persia could compare with Cyrus, "the servant of the Lord," his "shepherd," his "anointed," who allowed Judah to return and sacrifices  once more to be offered? The fact that he is also called Artaxerxes in the LXX., and the further fact that in the LXX. Version of Bel and the Dragon the name is omitted, are significant. The name must be laid aside as being of no evidential value. If now we look at the men - when we compare Darius, as presented to us by the narrative here, with Cyrus, the skilful, self-contained conqueror, who had broken the power of Asytages, had built up a monarchy from the small cantons of the region east of the Tigris, and increased that monarchy to an empire - we see a vast, irreconcilable difference. Cyrus must have been at the maturity of his power when he gained <span class="accented">possession</span> of Babylon. Darius, we are told, was sixty-two years of age. Yet once more, he "<span class="accented">received"</span> his kingdom. Cyrus did not claim as inheriting from Nabunahid. We must, then, definitely decide against Cyrus being Darius. The theory that has received the largest amount of support among those who maintain the ancient date of Daniel is that Darius the Mede is Cyaxares II. This is a personage introduced by Xenophon into his historical novel, the 'Cyropaedia.' If his existence could have been proved, the character suited the position admirably. The weaknesses and fussiness with which Xenophon endows him does not contradict anything we see of Darius here. Only Xenophon nowhere says that Cyrus made his uncle king in Babylon. We are in a very different position in regard to many of these events now, than we were forty years ago. We know now that Astyages was not the son of Cyaxares I., the King of the Medes. He Was King of the Manda or Umman-Manda, who overthrew the Median Empire. In Cyrus's revolts against Astyages we have no word of any relationship subsisting between him and his opponent, still less that he was his grandson. There is, further, no reference to any son of Astyages being regarded as monarch under whom Cyrus fought. Yet this must be acknowledged that, though Xenophon is at sea as to the capture of Babylon, he knew that Gobryas took a principal share in it. He associates with him a certain Gadates, which seems to be a word made from "Guti," the province from which Gobryas came. Herodotus, though he knows of a Gobryas who joined with Darius in conspiring against Smerdis, knows nothing of a Gobryas who took a principal part in the capture of Babylon. We are obliged, then, to dismiss Cyaxares II. as non-existent. On the faith of a passage in Herodotus (1:125) it has been supposed that Cyrus preserved Astyages, and may have set him as vice-king over Babylon. This, however, has nothing to support it. A much more plausible theory has been devised by Marcus yon Niebuhr, in his 'Geschichte Assur. u. Babils.' He maintained that Belshazzar was Evil-Merodach, and that he held the blasphemous feast narrated in Daniel, and that he was overthrown by a conspiracy assisted by the help of Astyages the Mede, and that Nergalsharezar (Neriglissar)reigned in Babylon as his subject-king. We know now that <span class="accented">Astyages</span> was not a Mede, but the King of the Mantis. We know further that there is no trace in the contract tables of the conquest of the city, so that there should be a foreign overlord. This, however, might not be notified in fixing the dates on the contracts. But if <span class="accented">Astyages</span> was for a year actual king in Babylon, then that fact would appear in the tables, and this is part of Baron yon Niebuhr's hypothesis. Further, <span class="accented">Astyages</span> does not retain his over-lordship in Babylon so far as we can judge from the proclamation of Nabunahid. We must, therefore, abandon this supposition also. The followers of the critical method, which assumes that there must be something outrageously wrong, take for granted that the Darius here is the well-known Darius Hy-staspis. The only point in him that suits Darius the Mede is that he is called Darius. It is true that Darius Hystaspis, after it had rebelled against him, took Babylon; there is nothing said of Darius the Mede doing anything of the sort, although it may be implied. Darius in Daniel is a Mede, Darius Hystaspis was a Persian; the Biblical Darius is the son of Ahashverosh (Ahasuerus), the other Darius is 'the son of Hystaspes; the Biblical Darius is an old man when he ascends the throne, Darius Hystaspis is young. Further, if we assume the writer of the fifth and sixth chapters of Daniel wrote also the eleventh, then he knew of Darius Hystaspis and of his son Xerxes, as well as of Cyrus and his son Cambyses. If these critics maintain the author of Daniel to be under the erroneous idea that Darius preceded Cyrus, how do they explain his knowledge that Darius reigned after Cyrus? We need not appeal merely to the eleventh chapter of Daniel. We are told to remark the fact that the names Daniel, Hananiah, Azariah, and Mishael all occur in Ezra and Nehemiah, as names of those who had returned from captivity, and we are expected to believe that from this source these came. If this writer studied Ezra so carefully as to pick out names to suit his purpose, how did he fail to see that Darius came not only after Cyrus, but after his two immediate successors, Cambyses and Smerdis? The critics are very ready to show us the sources of Daniel's knowledge;  they forget to harmonize these alleged sources of knowledge with the stupendous ignorance they attribute to him whenever this is required by the necessities of their argument. Whoever Darius the Mede is, he cannot be Darius Hystaspis. Another hypothesis has been started by Mr. Pinches of the British Museum - that Darius the Mede is Gobryas. We have seen that there is an uncertainty about the name. We know that in early Aramaic script the two names are not so very unlike, but that the less-known Gobaru might be read into the better known Darius. The main points known about both personages are in singularly exact historical parallel Darius received the kingdom; Gobaru (Og-baru, <span class="accented">Gobryas</span>) was admitted into Esakkil by the Babylonian confederates of Cyrus, and was made by Cyrus governor of Babylon. He exercised a certain amount of authority; for we are told, as above mentioned, that he appointed governors. Darius appointed governors. Darius was a Mede. and Gobryas was governor of the province of Guti or Gutlum, which was adjacent to Media, and therefore was not, improbably, a Mede. In thinking of this period, we are to dismiss from our minds all thought of the "Medes" being conquered by Cyrus and the Persians. Both Medes and Persians were oppressed by the Manda  - probably a Scythian horde - and Cyrus commenced the rebellion against the common oppressors, and united as one nation the Medes and the Persians. As to the character of Gobryas as compared with that of Darius. we have no data to go upon either to affirm or deny a resemblance. His age is not at all improbable. Altogether the balance of probability in the mean time points to Darius the Mede being Gobryas the governor of Gutinm. That he is addressed always as "king" does not contradict this, for Media and Persia and all that region had monarchies of the most limited description, and these monarchs retained their titles even under Cyrus's rule; hence, in his Behistun inscription, Darius claims his father to have been a king, and this while Cambyses reigned as king over the empire. After his son Darius had mounted the throne, Hystaspes was satrap in Persia. He would be addressed as "King Hystaspes," since by his son he is called king. Hence, if, as was likely, Gobryas was king of some small town or canton when he became governor of Gutium, he would be always "King Gobryas," or, as it has been written, "Darius." On the whole, then, as we have said, the balance of probability at present indicates Gobryas as Darius the Mede. <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/5.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 5"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 5" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/7.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 7"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 7" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/7.htm"><title>Daniel 7 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/7.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/7.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/7-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/6.htm" title="Daniel 6">&#9668;</a> Daniel 7 <a href="../daniel/8.htm" title="Daniel 8">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, <i>and</i> told the sum of the matters.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-28.</span> - THE VISION OF THE FOUR BEASTS. This chapter begins the second section of the book. All before this has been narrative; visions are introduced into the narrative, but they were not given to Daniel himself, but to others; his <span class="accented">role</span> was the secondary one of interpreter. These visions and the events connected with them are related more as incidents in the biography of Daniel, than as revelations of the future. With this chapter begins a series of revelations to Daniel personally. This chapter is the last chapter of the Aramaic portion of Daniel. Though thus linguistically joined to what has preceded, logically it is related to what follows. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Belshazzar King of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters</span>. The language of the Septuagint is suggestive of the actual state of matters, "While Baltasar was reigning - acting as king - for the first year, Daniel saw a vision beside (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;</span>) his head upon his bed. Then Daniel wrote the vision which he had seen in heads (chapters, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of narration (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." While these words do not necessarily imply that Belshazzar was not king, but only acting as king, they yet may mean this. We know now that for five years during the nominal reign of his father Nabunahid, Belshazzar really reigned. Theodotion does not absolutely agree with the Massoretic reading here, "In the first year of Belshazzar King of the Chaldeans, Daniel saw a dream (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) and the visions of his head upon his bed, and he wrote the dream." The omission of the final clause will be observed. The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic; it differs, in fact, only by the insertion of <span class="accented">malcootha</span>, "the reign of," before "Belshazzar." This is, in all probability, the original heading of the tract in which Daniel first published his prophecy. What were the circumstances, so far as we can attain a knowledge of them, when thus the future was revealed to Daniel? The Scythian forces under Astyages had conquered all the countries intermediate between the steppes whence they had come and Babylonia. Above all, they had overthrown the Median Empire, that was closely associated with that of Babylon. They had pressed in upon Babylonia, and were besieging its cities when Cyrus, the King of Ansan, rebelled against Astyages. We may imagine that, from the extent of their empire, the Manda would have to be  somewhat scattered. Cyrus then might easily gain advantage over the small division of Manda that held the canton of Ansan. As usually, the attacks of Elam and Media on Babylonia and Assyria had been made across the canton of Ansan; the rebellion of Ansan would thus separate the Manda in Elam and Media from those in Babylonia - the latter being the main portion. Cyrus succeeded in rousing the Medes, Elamites, and Persians against this invading horde, and wrested the power from them. Nabunahid, in a pious inscription, regards Cyrus as the instrument in the hand of Marduk to overthrow these oppressive Manda. Shortly after this uprising of Cyrus, Nabunahid is to appearance stricken with illness, and for several years takes no part in the business of the empire. In the seventh year of Nabunahid, we learn from the annals that the king was in Tema, and did not come to Babylon, but that the king's son conducted the affairs of the monarchy. It was probably, then, in this year, when Cyrus had defeated the Scythians, and had driven them out of Elam, Media, and Babylonia, that Daniel had the vision recounted in this chapter. Keen political insight might easily foresee the events in the comparatively immediate future. The rise of a vigorous new power like that of Persia meant menace to the neighbeuring powers. Babylonia, filled with treachery and discontent, was in no condition to resist. The fall of Babylon seemed imminent - its place was to be taken by Persia. But Babylon had succeeded Assyria, and before Assyria had been the empires of Egypt and the Hittites. He remembered the dream of his old master Nebuchadnezzar. Now a dream is vouchsafed to himself, which repeats the vision of Nebuchadnezzar with some differences. He is reminded that the changes that come over the affairs of men are not unending. The rise and fall of empires is not the confused whirl of uncontrolled atoms, but all tending towards an end - the establishment of the kingdom of God upon the earth. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-2.htm">Daniel 7:2</a></div><div class="verse">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea</span>. The Septuagint omits the introductory clause, and renders, "On my couch I saw in my night-sleep, and, behold, the four winds of heaven fell upon the great sea." Theodotion, like the LXX., omits the introductory clause, and renders, "I Daniel beheld, and, lo, the four winds of the heaven rushed upon (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) the great sea." The Peshitta seems as if transferred from the Massoretic text, the resemblance is so close. The variations in the Greek Version may be due to condensation of a fuller narrative. The verb translated "strove" in our Authorized Version is better rendered, as in the Revised, "brake forth upon." Luther's version is, "sturmeten wider einander." This, like the Authorized Version, seems to be the result of the Vulgate <span class="accented">pugnabant.</span> The only objection to this is that it ought to be followed by a preposition (Bevan). The translation suggested by Levy, "stirred up," appears still better. The sea referred to is naturally to be taken as the Mediterranean; it is "the great sea" of the prophets (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a>). Jerusalem is not so far from the sea but that Daniel might have seen it in his boyhood. The symbolic meaning of the sea is the mass of heathen nations (<a href="../../par/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>). The "four winds of heaven" usually stand for the points of the compass (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>). Here, however, the winds are pictured as actual forces dashing down upon the sea, and stirring it up to its depths. It may be objected that this is an impossible picture. It might be replied that Virgil, in the first book of the 'AEneid,' 84-86, and Milton, in 'Paradise Regained,' has the same thing. Daniel has more freedom, for he narrates a vision, and, further, to him the winds (<span class="accented">rucheen</span>) were under the guidance of angels. Hitzig denies that the winds can be <span class="accented">angelicae potestates</span>, as Jerome maintains; and, when Jerome supports his position by a quotation from the Septuagint Version of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, gives as answer a mark of exclamation. The passage, "He set the nations according to the number of the angels of God," represents a phase of thought in regard to angelology, which Daniel elsewhere obviously has. The double meaning of the word <span class="accented">ruach</span> made the transition easy. We see the same double meaning in <a href="../../par/zechariah/6-5.htm">Zechariah 6:5</a>. The sea, then, is to be regarded as the great mass of Gentile nations, and the winds are, therefore, the spiritual agencies by which God carries on the history of the world. As there are four winds, there are also four empires. There are angelic princes of at least two of these empires referred to later. May we not argue that these empires had, according to the thought of Daniel, each an angelic head? It may be doubted whether the most advanced critics know more of angelology than Daniel, or can be certain that his view was a mistaken one. Moreover, the Mediterranean Sea was the centre round which the epic of history, as revealed to Daniel, unfolded itself. Nebuchadnezzar marched along the eastern shores of that midland sea; the Persian monarchs essayed to command it by their fleets; across a branch of that sea came Alexander; and from yet further across its blue waters came the Romans. The Mediterranean saw most of the history  transacted that took place between the time of Daniel and that of our Lord.

Theodotion has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;</span>, but does not so slavishly follow the Aramaic construction at the end. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic, save that in the last clause it agrees with the LXX. The number four is, in apocalyptic writings, significant of the world; "the four winds" mean the whole world. Here it is human history that is summed up in the four beasts. So in Zechariah we have "four horns" that symbolize the oppressors of the people of God (<a href="../../par/daniel/1-18.htm">Daniel 1:18</a>; <a href="../../par/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1</a>). We have "four" chariots in the sixth chapter of Zechariah, which seem to be symbols of the same thing. <span class="accented">Beasts.</span> Animals of one sort or another are used of nations in the prophets; thus Egypt is symbolized in <a href="../../par/isaiah/27.htm">Isaiah 27</a>, as "leviathan," presumably a crocodile (<a href="../../par/isaiah/51-7.htm">Isaiah 51:7</a>), as "a dragon" in <a href="../../par/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a> Babylonia is figured as an eagle (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>). Composite beings are used as symbols also, as Tyro is addressed as a '"covering cherub." In the Book of Revelation Rome is figured as a beast with seven heads and ten horns (<a href="../../par/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). In the Book of Enoch (85. - 90.) we find this figurative use of animals carried much further. Assyria and Babylonia and, following them, Persia made great use of composite, monstrous animal forms as symbols, not so much, however, of political as of spiritual powers. This distinction is the less important, that political events were regarded as the production of spiritual activity. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a></div><div class="verse">The first <i>was</i> like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld till the wing. thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's heart was given to it</span>. The LXX. and Theodotion render "lioness," but otherwise agree with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta does not differ from the received text. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;</span> is epicene. It is, however, to be noted that in later Aramaic the terminal letter was <span class="aramaic">&#x5d0;</span>, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span>. The word <span class="accented">gappeen</span>, "wings," is worthy of note; in this form it appears in the Peshitta, <span class="accented">i.e. </span> in Eastern Aramaic; <span class="accented">genappeen</span> is the Targumie form. No modern commentator has doubted, with, I think, the single exception of Dr. Bonnar ('Great Interregnum'), that the first beast here is the Babylonian Empire (Hitzig, Zockler, Kliefoth, etc.). Nebuchadnezzar is compared (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-19.htm">Jeremiah 49:19</a>) to a lion and to an eagle (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; also <a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>), and suitable to this are the winged human-headed figures found in the ruins of Nineveh and Babylon. If we assume that the empire of Babylon is represented by this first beast, then we have to note, in the first place, the avoidance of any reference to numbers. It may be objected that the "eagle's wings," <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">gappeen</span>), are in the dual. Yet the number two is not mentioned. That the word was in the dual in the pre-Massoretic text does not appear from the versions, so the correctness of the dual pointing may be doubted. Unity was the mark of the Babylonian Empire in the vision of Nebuchadnezzar, and unity still remains its numerical sign. As swiftness and aggressiveness are symbolized by wings, especially "eagle's wings," when we read, "I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked," we learn that before the fall of Babylon a period set in, during which Babylonia ceased to be the aggressive conquering power it had been. <span class="accented">A man's heart was given to it.</span> J.D. Michaelis thinks the reference here is to the fact that when they first broke from their original seats, the Chaldeans were barbarians, but they became civilized in Babylonia. We know more now of the early history of Babylon and of the Chaldeans, and know that at one time the latter were divided into many cantons, each under its separate king, and that on and after the conquest of Babylon by Merodach-Baladan, they became more able to act in concert. The circumstances connected with the accession of Nabopolassar are wrapped in mystery. However, it is clear this cannot be the reference here. The giving of the man's heart is brought into close relationship with the plucking of the wings. This fact also decides us against the view so generally maintained, that there is here a reference to the madness of Nebuchadnezzar. In his case the heart of a beast was given to a man; in the case before us the heart of a man is given to a beast. To us the contrast seems more obvious than the resemblance. Much superior is Calvin's interpretation. Speaking of the phrases, "set upon his feet," and "the heart of a man was given to him," Calvin says, "By these modes of speech one understands that the Assyrians and Chaldeans were reduced in rank - that now they were not like lions, but like men" (comp. <a href="../../par/2_samuel/17-10.htm">2 Samuel 17:10</a>, "Whose heart is as the heart of a lion"). This is the view of Behrmann. There is no reference, then, to any supposed humanizing influences which manifested themselves in Babylonian methods of government after Nebuchadnezzar was restored to his reason. From being an empire that spread its wings over the earth, it became limited very much  to Babylonia, if not at times to little more than the territory surrounding the city of Babylon. We find that Nabunahid felt himself ready to be overwhelmed by the encroaching Manda. He manifests nothing of lion-like courage or eagle-like swiftness of assault. This was the state of things when Daniel had this vision. Nabunahid was in Tema, while his son did his best to defend the frontier against the threatening encroachments of Cyrus. Hitzig and Havernick maintain that the attitude suggested by the phrase, "set upon its feet," is what, in heraldic language, is called "rampant;" it is possible, but it rather militates against the natural meaning of the words. Before leaving this, it must be noted that, as in the vision Nebuchadnezzar had of the statue, the symbol of the Babylonian Empire is the noblest metal - the head of gold. Here the noblest animal is the symbol of Babylon  - "the lion." The same reason may be assigned here for this, as in the passage in the second chapter for that - that the Babylonian Empire had more in it of the symbol of Divine government. No monarch was more like a god to his subjects; his power was unchecked, unlimited, uncontrolled.

"A second" is omitted, and instead of "they said", it is "one said" or "he said." Theodotion agrees with the Septuagint in omitting the word "second," but agrees with the Massoretic in having "they said." The Peshitta begins more abruptly than the others, "And the second beast [was] like to a bear," etc. In regard to the Aramaic text, the use of the haphel form must be observed. The presence of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span> instead of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;</span> is an indication of antiquity in the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">besar</span>), which becomes in the Targums <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>. It has been supposed that the reading should be <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">bishayr</span>) with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which would mean" dominion" - a phrase that would give a sense out of harmony with the context. It is in regard to the meaning of this symbol that interpreters begin to be divided. The most common view is that this refers to the Median Empire. There is nothing to support the assumption that the author of Daniel distinguished between the Median and the Persian empires; everything, indeed, which, fairly interpreted, proves that, while he regarded the races as different, he looked upon the empire as one. It is the laws of "the Medes and the Persians" that are appealed to before Darius the Mede. The united empire is symbolized as a ram with two horns. Dr. Davidson, in his review of Professor Bevan's Commentary (<span class="accented">Critical Review</span>) on Daniel, shows the duality indicated by the animal raising one of its two sides. That one race was stronger than the other had to be symbolized, and this was done by making the symbolic animal raise one side. The attitude at first sight may be difficult to comprehend. There is a figure in Rawlinson's 'Five Great Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 332, in which a pair of winged bulls are kneeling with one leg; the side opposite to the kneeling leg is thus the higher. Kliefoth denounces this interpretation as mistaken, without assigning any reason against it. The interpretation by which he would supersede it is that it means "to one side of Babylonia." There is no reference to locality at all. Moreover, as all the animals come out of the sea, their relationship to Babylonia would be remote. <span class="accented">It had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it.</span> What is meant by these three ribs has been much debated. In the first place, Havernick thinks that it is a mistake to translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">il'een</span>) "ribs;" he maintains the true rendering to be "tusks." He identifies <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;</span> (Hebrew); but even if we grant this identification, we do not find any justification for this rendering. The word for "tusks" seems rather to be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;</span>, which occurs in the Targum of <a href="../../par/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> and <a href="../../par/job/29-17.htm">Job 29:17</a>, and the same word occurs in the Peshitta. At the same time, the symmetry of the figure would fit some such view. In none of the other beasts is there any reference to what they are devouring. Still, one cannot lay stress on this. When we come to consider what is meant by the "three ribs," we have great diversity of opinion. On the supposition that the ribs are in the mouth of the bear, and being gnawed by it, it must mean that at the time when by the conquest of Babylon it came into the apocalyptic succession, the bear-empire had laid waste three territories. Ewald agrees that three countries must be meant, but assumes these countries to be Babylonia, Assyria, Syria. There is no evidence, Biblical or other, that the Median Empire ever extended to Syria. If we grant that the author of Daniel lived in the time of Epiphanes, then no authority open to him, so tar as we know, brought the Medes into Syria before the day of the Persian rule. We need not assume a blunder for our author, and then build further assumptions on that assumed blunder. Moreover, by the conquest of Babylonia and Assyria, the bear came into the apocalyptic succession, whereas he had already devoured those provinces represented by ribs when he appears. Hitzig, following Ben Ezra, takes the ribs as three cities - Nineveh and two others. There seems nothing to identify "ribs" with "cities;" we can imagine it to  mean "provinces." Thus we are led to Kraniehfeld's opinion, that it represents constituent portions of an older confederation broken up. The view of Kliefoth, that the conquests of the Medo-Persian Empire are intended - Babylonia, Lydia, and Egypt - sins again st the symbol, which implies that the ribs are already in the bear's teeth when he enters into the sphere of apocalyptic history. Jephet-ibn-Ali maintains the "three fibs" to refer to the three quarters of the world over which the Persian Empire ruled; and this is the view of Keil. It seems better, with Von Lengerke, to regard the number three as not important, but a general term for a few, though, at the same time, we can make approximation to the number when we look not at the Medea, but at Cyrus. Moreover, had we a better knowledge of early apocalyptic, it is at least a possible thing that we might find that "three" was the designating number of Lydia or Armenia, as "two" was of Medo-Persia, "four" of Greece, "five" of Egypt, and "ten" of Rome. It seems to us that the position of Cyrus - at the time we assume the vision to have been given to Daniel  - suits admirably with the picture of the bear. Like the bear, he came from the mountains, in contradistinction from the lion of the plains. He united under his rule his hereditary kingdom Ansan, Elam, and Media. Thus we might have the three ribs if we might lay aside the notion of these being devoured. He overthrew the Manda and Croesus before he conquered Babylon, and it is probable that Armenia had also to be conquered before he could encounter Croesus. It is singular that writers who are determined to maintain that Daniel drew all his information as to Babylonian history from Jeremiah and other early writers, should also, by implication, maintain that, in defiance of the continual mention by these writers of kings of the Medes, as if they were a numerous confederacy (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-11.htm">Jeremiah 51:11</a>), Daniel held that there was a united empire of the Medes separate from the Persian Empire. The second empire is not, as maintained by Ewald, represented by a bear, "because its empire was less extensive than that of Babylon," but because it was a falling off from the theocratic monarch - the monarch who ruled as God. <span class="accented">They said thus unto it</span>, <span class="accented">Arise</span>, <span class="accented">devour much flesh.</span> The speakers here may be "the watchers," or it may be used impersonally. On the assumption that the bear is the shadowy Median Empire, what meaning can this command have? The Medes, as distinct from the Persians, by the time that Epiphanes ascended the throne, had become very shadowy. The scriptural account of them does not represent them as pre-eminently cruel. Isaiah (<a href="../../par/isaiah/13-17.htm">Isaiah 13:17</a>) foretells they will conquer Babylon, with all the concomitants of a city taken by assault. Jeremiah (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a>) places the Medes with other nations under the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon, and 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-6.htm">Daniel 7:6</a></div><div class="verse">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it</span>. The LXX. rendering is shorter, "And after these things I saw another beast, like a leopard, and four wings stretched over it (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and there were four heads to the beast." The grammar of this is difficult to understand. As it stands, it must be translated as above; if, however, we might read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, we should avoid the solecism of uniting a neuter plural to a plural verb, rendering, "and it stretched," etc. Paulus Tellensis renders as above, and adds a clause, "and a tongue was given to it" - a reading to all appearance due to the transposal of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. It is difficult, on the present text, to explain how the LXX. rendered "wings of a fowl," "stretched over it." If, however, the original word were that used in the Peshitta,  (<span class="accented">paehatha</span>), it is explicable that this should have been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>. Theodotion and the Peshitta do not differ from the Massoretic text. The majority of critical commentators maintain this to be the Persian Empire. A leopard is a less animal than a bear, and therefore, according to the argument these critics used with regard to the second empire, it ought to mean that it symbolized a still smaller empire. That, however, is impossible. No Jew of the age of the Maccabees could have been under that impression. Moreover, we have the four wings declared to mean that the Persian power extended to all quarters of the world, and attention is directed to the fact that the statement is made concerning it, "dominion was given to it." This assumes, what would be admitted by everybody to be contrary to fact, had the critics  not a further conclusion in view. The traditional interpretation is that the Hellenic Empire - that of Alexander the Great and his successors - is intended here. In defence of this we have the fact that four, as we have just said, is the numerical sign of the Greek power. In the following chapter we have the goat, with its one notable horn, which, on being broken off, is replaced by four. In the eleventh chapter we are told that Alexander's empire is to be divided to the four winds of heaven. But "wings" are not prophetically so much the symbol of extensive dominion, as of rapidity of movement. If Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/17-3.htm">Ezekiel 17:3</a>) is a great eagle with long wings, it is because of the rapidity of his conquests. Jeremiah says of his horses, they are "swifter than eagles." Again in Lamentations, "Our persecutors are swifter than eagles." Wings, then, symbolize swiftness of motion. If we turn to the next chapter, the swiftness of Alexander's conquests is the point that most impresses the seer. Swiftness, compared either with the conquests of Nebuchadnezzar or of Alexander, was not the characteristic of the Persian conquests. Cyrus, in the course of thirty years, had subdued Asia Minor, probably Armenia; had relieved Media, Elam, and Persia from the alien yoke of the Manda; and had conquered Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar, after the battle of Carehemish, had advanced to the river of Egypt. We do not know the extent and direction of his many campaigns, but rapidity of movement characterized some of them we do know, and Alexander's conquests were made with extreme rapidity. Altogether the figure seems much more suitable for the empire of Alexander than for that of the Persians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-7.htm">Daniel 7:7</a></div><div class="verse">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it <i>was</i> diverse from all the beasts that <i>were</i> before it; and it had ten horns.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</span> The version of the LXX. differs considerably, though not essentially, "After these things I beheld in a night vision a fourth terrible beast, and the fear of it excelled in strength; it had great iron teeth, it devoured and pounded down; it trode round about with its feet; it differed from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns, and many counsels were in its horns." The sense of this does not really differ, save in the last clause, which seems to belong to the next verse. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only by having" after these things," following the LXX., instead of "after this." The identification of the empire intended by this beast has been the <span class="accented">crux</span> of interpreters. Practically all ancient authorities - Josephus, and the author of the Apocalypse of Baruch being among the number - maintain the Roman Empire to be meant. On the other hand, a very large number of modern critics, not merely of the exclusively critical school, have held that it refers either to the Greek Empire as a whole, or to the Seleucid portion of it. As we shall discuss this subject in a separate excursus, we shall at present look at the principles to be adopted in dealing with such a question. The important point is the numerical note of this "beast." It is "ten" - the same it may be remarked, as in the feet of the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream. When we turn from the Apocalypse of the Old Testament to the Apocalypse of the New, we find "ten" the note of Rome. Even though we should put this to the one side, as merely the opinion of an apostle, and therefore not to be considered at all in comparison with that of Hitzig or Von Lengerke, yet he was writing little more than a couple of centuries from the time when, according to critics, Daniel was written; moreover, he was in the direct line of apocalyptic tradition. The Apocalypse of Baruch, written in all probability  <span class="date">B.C. 60</span>, has the same view, and it is separated by little more than a century from the time of the Maccabees. The Fourth Book of Esdras, written about A.D. , has the same view. All three books imply that it is the universally received opinion. This view is really the only one that fairly meets the case. The view which separates the Seleucid Empire from that of Alexander may be laid aside, although the first three empires are correctly interpreted, because it is directly controverted by the statement that this fourth empire is to be diverse from all that had gone before. The empire of the Seleucids was in no sense diverse from that of Alexander. This fourth empire was to be stronger than all that had gone before. The Seleucid Empire was notoriously and obviously less powerful than the empire of Alexander had been, and was merely a match for the empire of the Ptolemies. Further, the next chapter shows that the writer of Daniel regarded the empire of the Diadochi as really a continuation of that of Alexander the Great. The other view rests on a division between the Median and the Persian empires, which is contradicted by any fair interpretation of this book. The next chapter shows clearly that the writer regarded the Medo-Persian power as one, but as having two dominant races. The" great iron teeth" of the beast have a reference to the iron legs of the dream-image which appeared to Nebuchadnezzar. This beast "is  diverse from all the beasts that were before it." In all the previous empires, the constitution was avowedly monarchical. With the Roman, the republican constitution appeared, and even under the emperors the forms of that constitution were preserved. In this sense it was diverse from all the preceding empires. Mr. Bevan thinks "the actrocious massacres at Tyro and elsewhere, by which Alexander en-deavoured to strike terror into the conquered races," is symbolized by the monster "devouring, crushing," etc. Mr. Bevan must never have read the accounts of the conquests of Asshur-bani-pal. He seems to have forgotten the treatment meted out to Samos and Miletus by the Persians. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a></div><div class="verse">I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn <i>were</i> eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I considered the horns, and,behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and,</span> <span class="cmt_word">behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</span> The Septuagint Version, if we consider it a rendering of the Massorotic, begins really with the words which are made in it the last clause of the preceding verse, "And counsels were many in its horns." This reading is certainly not to be preferred, although it can easily be understood how it has arisen. The version proceeds, "And behold another born sprang up in the midst of them - little in its horns" - this latter is a doublet - "and three of the former horns were rooted cut by it, and, behold, eyes as human eyes were in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things, and it made war against the saints." Theodotion is practically in agreement with the Massoretic text, as is also the Peshitta. As Daniel is gazing, his attention is directed to the horns; he sees their appearance changing. An eleventh horn springs up, much less than any of the former ten; quickly, however, it grows, and before its growth three of the former horns are rooted up. This horn now drew his gaze from all the others: it had human eyes, it had a mouth speaking great things. In the changes of the dream the horn now seems separated from the animal on which it is; it becomes an oppressor, and makes war upon the saints. It is usual to identify this horn with that in ch. 8:7. When carefully looked at, the alleged resemblance is reduced to the fact that in both cases "a horn" is used as a symbol of an oppressor of the saints. We must remember that, according to the figure, these ten horns are contemporary. If we take the typology of the next chapter as our guide, these horns are kingdoms or dynasties. Unlike the Greek Empire, which split up into four, this fourth empire splits up into ten. Another dynasty rises up and sweeps away three of these earlier dynasties. Nothing like this occurred in regard to the empire of the Diadochi. Of course, it is true the number ought not to be pressed, save as a designative symbol. There must, however, be more than five or six, as in such a case <span class="accented">four</span> would be a more natural general number. It may, however, be twelve or fifteen. Several events in the history of the kingdoms that have followed the Roman Empire might satisfy one part of this picture - the replacing of three kingdoms by one. It is a possible enough view that provinces may be referred to, as Jephet-ibn. Ali maintains. As, however, the primary significance of the "horn" is power, the most probable solution seems to us to be to take the "ten" horns as the magistracies of Republican Rome. If we reckon the magistracies, there were fewer, if we take the distinctive individuals occupying the magistracies, more, than ten. The imperial form of government replaced several of these magistracies, which may roughly be reckoned at three. Certainly of the imperial power it might be said that it had a mouth "speaking great things;" for the claim to deification made openly was certainly a new claim. Other monarchs had claimed to be the sons of their god; only the Roman emperors were addressed as <span class="accented">divus</span> during their lifetime. Certainly the empire made war against the saints - against the people of God. It was Nero, a Roman emperor, who decreed war against the Jews; it was Vespasian, another Roman emperor, that began the conquest of Palestine; it was Titus, a third Roman emperor, that captured Jerusalem. Some support may be found for the Jewish idea that it is Titus personally. If we are permitted to take the ten horns as successive emperors, he was the eleventh emperor, and three emperors were swept away before the Flavian dynasty. We must reserve fuller discussion of this subject to a special excursus.

A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</span> The Septuagint Version here does not differ much from the Massoretic save that there are two cases of-doublet. Theodotion and the Peshitta are evidently translated from a text identical with that of the Massoretic. There is, however, one point where the versions agree against the Authorized Version - the thrones are not cast down, they are "placed," as  in the Revised. Luther and most German commentators render thus, as does Jerome. Ewald translates "cast," that is, "set." In the third chapter, where we have the same word, it means" cast down; "this leads us to prefer the Authorized rendering. The word for "throne" is to be observed. It means not so much the throne-royal as the seat of a judge (Behrmann); but the office of judge was that essentially of the king. <span class="accented">The Ancient of days did sit.</span> It is not "<span class="accented">the</span> Ancient of days," but "one ancient in days," that is to say, the phrase is not appellative, but descriptive. After the thrones of these earlier kingdoms were cast down, then one appeared like an old man clad in a garment of snowy whiteness, and the hair of his head as wool. That this is a symbolic appearance of God is beyond doubt. Ewald remarks on the grandeur of the description as excelling in boldness even the vision of Ezekiel. The throne, the judgment-seat of the Ancient of days, is a chariot of "fiery flame," with "wheels of burning fire" - a description that suggests the translation of Elijah. His throne is at once the judge's scat and the chariot of the warrior. From beneath this chariot-throne "a fiery stream issued forth." In the Book of Revelation (<a href="../../par/revelation/22-1.htm">Revelation 22:1</a>), from beneath the throne of God there issued the river of the water of life, clear as crystal Compare with this also Enoch 14:9-22. Enoch's description is derived from this, but amplified to a great extent. <span class="accented">Thousand thousands ministered unto him</span>, <span class="accented">and ten thousand times tea thousand stood before him.</span> The word "thousands" in the Aramaic has the Hebrew plural termination in the K'thib, but in the most ancient forms of Aramaic there are many points where the two tongues have not yet diverged. The symbol here is of a royal court, only the numbers are vaster than any earthly court could show. The angels of God are present to carry out the decisions of the judgment. Compare with this Enoch 1:9 (Charles's trans), "Lo! he comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, to execute judgment upon them." Those that minister unto the Judge are those whose duty it is to carry out the Divine sentence; those who stand before him are those who are spectators of this great assize. <span class="accented">The judgment was set.</span> This translation is not accurate. The word translated "was set" is the same as that rendered in the second clause of the preceding verse "did sit." Again, although <span class="accented">deena</span>, thus vocalized, means "judgment," it may be differently vocalized, <span class="accented">dayyana</span>, and mean "Judge." If we take the present pointing, the phrase may be taken as equivalent to "the assize began." <span class="accented">And the books were opened.</span> It ought to be noted that the word here used for" books" is derived from a root primarily meaning "engrave." The Babylonian books, as they have come down to us, are clay tablets "engraved" or "impressed" with letters. We have all manner of legal documents in this form. The piles of tiles and cylinders which contain the deeds of those before the judgment-seat stand before the Judge. One by one they are displayed before him. The scene presented is one of unspeakable grandeur, and all put before us with a few masterly strokes. We see the great fiery throne'; the Judge, awful with the dignity of unnumbered ages, attended by a million of angels who are ready to do his will; and a hundred million watching and listening spectators. We find that this description of the judgment in the first Apocalypse reappears, modified and made yet more solemn, in the last Apocalypse. We are, however, not to regard this as the final judgment. Daniel is rather admitted into the presence of God in the heavens, and sees his judgment continually being prepared against the wicked.

The Septuagint Version has been translated from the same text; but the word translated "because" is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, "then," according to the usual meaning of the word. Theodotion has a doublet. The Peshitta is much briefer, "I saw that this beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was cast into the flame of fire." <span class="accented">The voice of the great words</span>; that is, blasphemies. The punishment of blasphemy among the Babylonians was burning. On account of the blasphemies of the little horn, the whole empire to which it belonged was destroyed. If we regard the fourth beast as Rome, and the little horn the imperial dignity, it was on account of its blasphemies that the empire really ceased. The blasphemous claim to divinity wrought madness in the minds of such youths as Caligula, Nero, Commodus, Caracalla, and Heliogabalus. The process might be a slow one. God had his purpose in the history of the race to work out by the Roman Empire; yet it was none the less the madness of the emperors that brought the empire down. The way the provinces were harried by barbarians East and West could well be described as burning the body of it with fire. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-12.htm">Daniel 7:12</a></div><div class="verse">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time</span>. The version of the LXX. has a different reference, "And those about him he took away from their dominion, and time of life was given them for a time and a season." Here, as in the seventh verse, <span class="cmt_word"></span> we have <span class="accented">shear.</span> The reference then would be to the horns that still remained after the one blaspheming horn was destroyed. Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic. The Peshitta differs, but only slightly. As the Massoretic text stands, there is difficulty in maintaining that the reference here cannot be to any other than to the other three beasts. They should still occupy a place, but possess no dominion, even after they were removed from supreme authority. After Babylon lost imperial power, it still continued for a time a highly important province in the Persian Empire, and the sensibilities of the inhabitants were considered throughout the whole period of the Persian rule. After the Persian Empire was overturned by Alexander, there was still the province of Persis; and from the remains of the Persian Empire sprang up Parthia, and then the second Persian Empire; and after the rule of the caliphs had been broken, Persia revived as a Mohammedan power. When the Greek Empire fell, Greece still survived, not independent, but still influential. It is difficult to see what meaning this verse could have to one living at the time of the Maccabees, especially it' he thought the Greek Empire was the fourth. Parthia certainly might represent Persia, but where was Media? "For a season and a time" does not refer to any definite time. Jephet-ibn-Ali regards the reference till the end of the rule of the fourth beast. This militates against the idea that '<span class="accented">iddan</span> must always mean "a year." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a></div><div class="verse">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, <i>one</i> like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him</span>. The version of the Septuagint is different in the last two clauses of this verse, "As the Ancient of days he came, and those standing around were present to him." Although the reading here is supported by Paulus Tellensis, we suspect some error of copyists. Theodotion practically agrees with the Massoretic. The Peshitta renders the last clause, "Those standing before him approached him." These earthly kingdoms having been destroyed, the new kingdom of God is ushered in. "A son of man" (not "the Son of man," as in our Authorized Version) appears in the clouds of heaven. It is a question whether this is the King of the Divine kingdom, the personal Messiah, or the kingdom itself personified. It is agreed that, as the previous kingdoms were represented by a beast, a man would be necessary symmetrically to represent at once the fact that it is an empire as those were, but unlike them in being of a higher class, as man is higher than the beasts. Further, it is brought in line with the image-vision of the second chapter, where the stone cut out of the mountain destroys the image. But we must beware of applying mere logic to apocalyptic. In this vision we see that "a man's heart" really meant weakness as compared with the courage and strength represented by the lion. Further, the point of distinction between this vision and that of Nebuchadnezzar is that this is more dynastic, looking at the monarchs, while the other looks at the powers - the empires as distinct from their personal rulers. Hence, while the Son of man here refers to the Messianic kingdom, it is in the Person of its King. It is to be observed that, while the beasts came up out of the sea, the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven. This indicates the Divine origin of the Messiah. That the writer might not apprehend this is no argument against this being really symbolized. When he comes to the throne of the Ancient of days, he is accompanied to the presence of the Judge by the attendant angels - a scene which might seem to justify the LXX. Version of <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/32-43.htm">Deuteronomy 32:43</a> as applied by the writer of the Hebrews. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a></div><div class="verse">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion <i>is</i> an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom <i>that</i> which shall not be destroyed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be</span> <span class="cmt_word">destroyed.</span> The versions differ only slightly and verbally from this. The personal element is here made prominent. Compare with this <a href="../../par/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing." The Messianic kingdom, and with it the Messiah, was to be everlasting. The resemblance is great, as might be expected, between this statement and that in <a href="../../par/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, "A kingdom which shall never be destroyed, and the kingdom shall not be left to other people." It is to be noted that even his dominion is bestowed upon him. The Ancient of days, whose sentence has deprived the other dynasties of theft empire, bestows boundless empire on the Messiah (Comp. <a href="../../par/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2</a>. and 72.). Jeremiah's account of the state of matters on the return from the Captivity (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>)is compared to this by Hitzig; but there it is not a <span class="accented">king</span> who is to come near before God, it is simply "governor" (<span class="accented">mashal</span>). In Jeremiah we have to do with a subject-people living in the fear of the Lord, but under the yoke of a foreign power.  <span class="accented">Ecursus on</span> "<span class="accented">The Son</span> <span class="accented">of Man."</span> The title given here to the Messiah for the first time, appears prominently in the Book of Enoch, and becomes consecrated to us in the lips of our Lord, as the favourite title by which he designated himself as the Messiah. The phrase, "son of man," <span class="accented">ben-adam</span>, is used of man as contrasted with God: <a href="../../par/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, "God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent;" of man as weak: <a href="../../par/isaiah/51-12.htm">Isaiah 51:12</a>, "Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as the grass?" (so <a href="../../par/job/25-6.htm">Job 25:6</a>; <a href="../../par/psalms/144-3.htm">Psalm 144:3</a>). Again, it is used simply as equivalent to "man:" <a href="../../par/jeremiah/49-18.htm">Jeremiah 49:18</a>, "No man shall abide there, neither shall son of man dwell in it" (see also <a href="../../par/jeremiah/51-43.htm">Jeremiah 51:43</a>). The contrast, so far as there is a contrast, is between <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5df;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>. In the Psalms we have <span class="accented">benee</span> <span class="accented">adam</span> and <span class="accented">benee ish</span> contrasted: <a href="../../par/psalms/62-9.htm">Psalm 62:9</a>, "Surely men of low degree (<span class="accented">benee adam</span>) are vanity, and men of high degree (<span class="accented">benee ish</span>) are a lie." This distinction does not apply to Aramaic, in which <span class="accented">enush is</span> the only generally used word for "man." In the prophecies of Ezekiel the phrase becomes determinative of the prophet. The question is complicated, however, by the fact that in Eastern Aramaic <span class="accented">barnesh</span>, a contraction for <span class="accented">bar-enasho</span>, is used very generally for "men," as <span class="accented">col-bar-nesh</span>, "<span class="accented">everybody."</span> It also occurs in this sense in Targumic, though more rarely, as <a href="../../par/job/5-7.htm">Job 5:7</a>. The title here, then, simply declares that one, having the appearance of a man, was seen coming in the clouds of heaven. The phrase in the Peshitta for "the Son of man" is <span class="accented">batch d'nosh.</span> It is implied that this mysterious Being had the form of a man, but further, it is implied that he was other than man. In the Book of Enoch the phrase has ceased to be descriptive merely, and has become an appellation. Thus Enoch 46.: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> And there I saw one who had a head of days, and his head was white like wool, and with him was another being, whose countenance had the appearance of a man, and his face was full of graciousness like one of the holy angels. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> And I asked the angel who went with me and showed me all the hidden things concerning that Son of man, who he was, and why he went with the Head of days. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> And he answered and said unto me, This is the Son of man, who hath righteousness, with whom dwelleth righteousness, and who reveals all the treasures of that which is hidden, because the Lord of spirits hath chosen him, and his lot before the Lord of spirits hath surpassed everything in uprightness for ever. This is clearly borrowed from the chapter before us. Elsewhere we have endeavoured to fix the date of this part of the Book of Enoch, as  <span class="date">B.C. 210</span>. Of course, in this view the Maccabean origin of Daniel is definitely set aside. If, however, we take the date assigned to this part by Mr. Charles, then we have a choice between approximately  <span class="date">B.C. 90</span> and  <span class="date">B.C. 70</span>. Even then the date seems too near the critical date of Daniel to explain the rapid development the idea has undergone. In Daniel the person "like a son of man" may be a personification of Israel, though not naturally so; here in Enoch we have to do with a super-angelic being. As to the question of the reference of the title, it has been doubted whether it is to be held as applying to the Messiah, the Messianic kingdom, or to the people of Israel. The last view is that of Hitzig and many other critics of his school. It practically involves a denial of the truth of the idea that the Jews ever had Messianic hopes. In the present case there is nothing to indicate any reference to Israel personified. While there might be some plausibility in arguing from each of the four beasts representing empires that this "Son of man" should represent an empire also; it must be observed that in all the other cases there is a peculiarity which marks off the animal as merely a symbol: the lion has wings; the bear has three ribs in its teeth; the leopard has four heads and four wings; and the last, unnamed, beast has ten heads and iron teeth. Further, this "Son of man" is brought to the Ancient of days, and does not merely appear as do the "beasts." He has thus many of the characteristics of a person. The other view, that the "Son of man" indicates the Messianic kingdom, thus comes into line with the view of Hitzig. The view that it is the Messiah who is meant by the "Son of man" was held practically by all interpreters, Jewish and Christian, until the middle of last century. If we look at the phenomenon of prophetism, we shall find ourselves open to another view of the matter. From <a href="../../par/1_peter/1-10.htm">1 Peter 1:10</a> we see that prophets did not necessarily <span class="accented">know</span> the meaning of their own prophecies. It might well be, then, that to Daniel the distinction between the Messianic King and the Messianic kingdom was not one clearly apprehended. We see in the prophecies of the second Isaiah that the "servant of the Lord" is first the holy people, then the prophetic order, and latterly a person. There probably was a similar uncertainty here. If we grant this  indeffiniteness, the next question that rises is - What is the special aspect of the Messianic kingdom that is intended to be portrayed when this title is given to its King? If we are guided by what is incomparably the oldest interpretation, that of the second Book of Enoch, this title implies an incalculable dignity. When we come to our Lord's use of it in the Gospels, there is nothing to oppose this. Thus <a href="../../par/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>, "And hath committed all judgment unto him, because he is the Son of man;" so <a href="../../par/matthew/9-6.htm">Matthew 9:6</a>, "The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins." This is not contradicted by <a href="../../par/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>, "The foxes have holes,...  but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." The emphasis of the statement lies in the contrast between the inexpressible dignity of the Person and the poverty of his earthly circumstances. It is because the ideas of superhuman dignity had been associated with the title that our Lord had, in foretelling his approaching crucifixion,. to bring the two facts into close connection, "The Son of man must be lifted up." So after Peter's confession, "The Son of man must suffer many things." We see that the multitude of the Jews understood the title to have this lofty meaning, for they demand (<a href="../../par/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>), "How sayest thou, The Sen of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?" The attempts to make it imply something humiliating by dwelling on the fact that not <span class="accented">adam</span> or <span class="accented">ish is</span> the word for "man," but '<span class="accented">enosh</span>, are beside the question, for these deductions apply to the Hebrew words, not to the Aramaic. And in Aramaic neither <span class="accented">ish</span> nor <span class="accented">adam</span> is in common use as equivalent for "man." It is as much beside the point as if one, knowing the difference between <span class="accented">man</span> and <span class="accented">mann</span> in German, should lay stress on the fact that in this phrase in English "man" has only one <span class="accented">n</span>. The connection of this surpassing dignity with humanity has probably deep roots in human nature. The late Professor Fuller saw reference here to the function occupied by Silik-mooloo-Khi as mediator between Hea and mankind, and to the further development of this in the Zoroastrian doctrine of a <span class="accented">sosiosh</span>, or redeemer. The fall investigation of this is beside our present purpose.

These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth, But the saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</span> The version of the Septuagint differs in some points from the Massoretic. In the fifteenth verse there is no reference to the spirit being in the body; it adds "of the night" after "visions," and changes "my head" into "my thoughts." The sixteenth verse presents no essential points of difference. In the seventeenth verse the differences are more considerable, "These great beasts are four kingdoms, which shall be destroyed from the earth." There seems a good deal to be said for the reading behind this version. The first variation, "kingdoms" instead of "kings," may be due to logic, but it has further "destroyed from" instead of "arising out of," which cannot have resulted from the Massoretic. The verb <span class="accented">qoom</span>, "to stand up," followed by <span class="accented">rain</span>, "from," is not elsewhere used in the sense which we find in the Massoretic here. When one is prone on the earth, as Saul before the revelation of the witch of Endor, "he stood up from the earth" (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/28-23.htm">1 Samuel 28:23</a>, Targum Jonathan)  - word for word as here. When Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/23-3.htm">Genesis 23:3</a>, Targum Onkelos) arose from before his dead, we have a similar construction. In <a href="../../par/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>, "David arose from his couch." This construction involves Change of position, either directly or implicitly. It is difficult to understand how the one reading arose from the other. The condensation of the sense as it appears in the Septuagint is not likely to be attained by a <span class="accented">falsarius.</span> In ver. 18 there is nothing calling for remark, save that the reduplication of "for ever and ever "is omitted. While Theodotion is nearer the Massoretic text, he too differs from it in some points - his rendering of <span class="accented">nidnay</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. Schleusner thinks this probably a false reading for <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. However, in <a href="../../par/judges/14-9.htm">Judges 14:9</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> used for "body." In the seventeenth verse we have "kingdoms" instead of "kings." The last clause agrees with the Massoretic, but there is subjoined <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "which shall be taken away" - an addition that suggests that some of the manuscripts before Theodotion had the same reading as that before the Septuagint translator. He renders <span class="accented">yeqoomoon rain</span> by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, showing that at all events he had a different preposition. The reduplication of "for ever and ever" is omitted. The Peshitta ver. 15 has "in the midst of my couch" instead of "in the midst of my body." In the sixteenth verse it resolves the bystanders into "servants." In the seventeenth verse the preposition is not <span class="accented">rain</span>, but '<span class="accented">al.</span> Jerome, instead of <span class="accented">corpus</span>, "body," has <span class="accented">in his</span>, "in these," - as if he had read <span class="accented">b'idena</span> instead of <span class="accented">nidnay</span>; he also  in ver. 17 reads <span class="accented">regna</span>, not <span class="accented">reges.</span> The Mas-seretic text has some peculiarities. The first words afford one of the rare instances where we have the 'ithpael instead of the hithpael; it may be due to scribal correction. In the seventeenth verse '<span class="accented">inoon</span> (K'thib) affords an instance of the frequent Syriasm in Daniel. The "Most High" is rendered by a plural adjective, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> ('<span class="accented">elyoneen</span>); it is explained differently. Kranichfeld and Stuart regard it as <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae.</span> Bevan and Behrmann regard it as a case of attraction, the latter giving as parallel instances, <span class="accented">hence</span> '<span class="accented">ayleem</span> (<a href="../../par/psalms/29-1.htm">Psalm 29:1</a>) and <span class="accented">benee nebeem.</span> The difficulty remains that neither the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> nor change of number is known in Aramaic. The fact that this strange form has produced no effect on any of the versions makes the reading suspicious. Professor Fuller sees in this word a proof of Babylonian influence, but he does not assign his reason, We now enter a new stage in the development of this vision. After the wonderful assize has ended, Daniel dreams that he is still standing among these innumerable multitudes, and, feeling that all these things are symbols, he is grieved because he cannot comprehend what is meant by them. So from one of those attendants who crowd the canvas of his vision he asks an explanation, or rather "the certainty," of this vision; he wishes to know whether it is s mere vision or of the nature of a revelation. This is a perfectly natural psychological condition in dreaming. In the act of dreaming we question ourselves whether we are dreaming or not; we may even ask one of the characters in our dream the question. The interpretation is interesting, but has been already, to some extent forestalled. A difficulty is seen by some commentators - how these four kingdoms could be said to arise, when one of them was nearing its fall. If we take the reading of the Septuagint, this difficulty is obviated. Saadia Gaon makes these four kings the nominative to the verb "receive" (wrongly translated in our Authorized Version, "take"), and maintains each of these empires shall hold the kingdom of Israel until the Messiah shall come. This view would necessitate grammatically that the Messiah should never come, but that the reign of these four world-empires should be prolonged into eternity. "The saints of the Most High," in the thought of Daniel would be, of necessity, the Jews; for we need not discuss the possibility of the angels being the holy ones implied here  - they always have the kingdoms of the world under them - but we may see the Israel of faith in this figure. The believers in Christ are the true Israel, and the kingdom of heaven which Christ set up is thus promised to fill the earth. The Church is thus the true ultimate state. If we regard the Church as a society formed of those who are mutually attracted to each other. have a mutual love for each other, end have a common love to God, then all the history of the world is tending towards the establishment of such a society, universal as the world. National hatreds are much less acute now than they were. Despite the efforts to rouse class against class, there seems more sympathy between classes than there was. The final break-down of national and class oppositions, not necessarily by the abolition of either class or nation, will prepare the way for the Christ-commanded love which is the tie that unites the members of the true eternal Church of God.

I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom</span>. In regard to the version of the LXX. here, we have the advantage of Justin Martyr's transcription, in which, however, the difference from the Chigi texts are not of great importance. The LXX. here is pretty close to the Masseretic text. "Behold" has intruded into the text; it is, however, omitted from Justin Martyr. Another clause, evidently a doublet, is emitted also, and the clause assumes nearly the shape it has in Theodotion. It is difficult to imagine how the reading of the LXX. arose. The differences from the Massoretic text are for the rest not essential. This is the case with Theodotion and the Peshitta. These verses to some extent recapitulate the earlier description of this fourth beast. There are, however, features added - to the "iron teeth" of the seventh verse are added "claws of brass." The main change is in regard to the little horn that came up last. We not only learn here that three other horns were plucked up before it, but the personification is now carried further, and the horn makes war against the saints, and prevails against them. This description does not suit Epiphanes. He certainly made war against the saints, but as certainly he did not prevail  against them. When he came up from Egypt, and entered into the sanctuary and plundered it, he could not be said to make war against Israel. Judaea was one of his own provinces. When a tyrannical government takes possession of the wealth and property of individuals or corporations, it may be called cruel and oppressive, but its conduct is not called war. Even the massacre of the inhabitants of Jerusalem by the collector of taxes was not war. There was no war levied by Epiphanes against the saints till Mattathias and his sons rebelled, and thereafter Epiphanes did not prevail against the Jews. The Romans did make war against Israel, and did prevail. If the saints are a nation, then Epiphanes did not prevail in war against them If persecution is to be regarded as warfare, then it is not warfare against a nation, but against a community like a Church. If we look upon the Christian Church as succeeding to the position of Israel, then Rome persecuted the Church, and persecution ceased only when Rome became Christian. But a wider view opens itself to us. All modern states are in a sense a continuance of Rome, and so far as they do not submit themselves to the direction of Christ, they are still at war with the saints. It is only when the Son of man comes in his power that the kingdom will belong to the saints. It is to be observed, the figure of an assize is still kept up, and "judgment is given to" or "for the saints," and in virtue of this decision they possess the kingdom.

The text as given by Justin Martyr is slightly shorter by omitting some words. Theodotion and the Peshitta also agree. What remarks can be made on this have been made already. It is to be observed that it is the whole earth that is devoured by the fourth beast as presented to us now. In the earlier presentation, although very terrible, his devastation is limited. There is nothing said to indicate that the kings are successive, but the inference rather is that they are contemporaries. The attempts are many that have been made to make out ten kings before Epiphanes, but they have all failed. If the fourth kingdom is the Greek Empire, then ten is a number far too small for the various kings of the different dynasties that sprang up There were seven or eight Lagids, as many Seleucids, three or four Attalids, five or six Antigonids, not to speak of such men as Lysimaehus and Perdiecas, who were kings, but who did not found dynasties. If the fourth kingdom is tacitly reduced to the Syrian kingdom, then how is it explained that the author of 'Daniel' was ignorant, in the seventh chapter, that the Lagids were also successors of Alexander as well as the Seleucids? How could a man living in the age of the Maccabees imagine the Seleucids rulers of the world, when Epiphanes had been a hostage in Rome? A great power does not give, but receives, hostages. We know from First Maccabees that the Jews were well aware of this, and also of the check the Romans were on Epiphanes. Even if Daniel wrote at the time chosen by the critics, how came he to be so ignorant as to imagine the Seleueid Empire to be so tremendously great? <span class="accented">He shall subdue three kings.</span> Who are the three kings of the ten who preceded him whom Epiphanes subdued? Seleucus Philopator, Heliodorus, and Demetrius Soter are given by Professor Bevan. But Demetrius Sorer did not ascend the throne till after the death of Epiphanes. It is extremely doubtful whether Heliodorus ever assumed the crown. Our whole knowledge of him is from Appian. Josephus knows nothing of Heliodorus. The Second Book of Maccabees, though telling a legendary story of Heliodorus, gives no account of his murder of his master and attempt to take the crown. Our sole authority for this whole story is Appian, who wrote three centuries after the event, and manifests considerable confusion at times, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> represents Attalus and Eu-menes as being two sovereigns independent of each other, whereas the one succeeded the other. If Seleucus Philopator is to be reckoned as "subdued" or "humbled" before Epiphanes, as well might all the rest of his predecessors. The Jewish interpretation, that the little horn is the Flavian dynasty, has far more verisimilitude. Certainly Galba Vitellius and Otho had been humbled before the Flavians. If we consider the horn "magistracies," certainly the absorption into the imperial dignity of all the higher magistracies might well be reckoned humbling them.

And the kingdom  and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaved, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him</span>. The versions do not present much of note in, ver. 25, save that the Greek versions imply that dominion over all is given to the oppressors. Throughout the Septuagint has traces of explanatory expansion. <span class="accented">He shall speak words against the Most High.</span> The word "against," <span class="accented">letzad</span>, is really "to the side of." This clause may refer to blasphemy against God, but more naturally refers to self-exaltation to a place alongside of God. <span class="accented">Shall wear out the saints of the Most High.</span> Persecute them, or maintain war against them; the natural meaning of the word is "afflict." <span class="accented">And shall think to change times and laws.</span> It ought not to be "laws," in the plural, but "law." It may refer to the marked changes introduced into the calendar by Julius Caesar. Certainly the law or constitution of the Roman state was changed by him. <span class="accented">And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</span> Who shall be given into his hands? It is usually assumed that it is the saints; but the LXX. asserts that it is universal dominion that is given into the hands of the oppressors. We have no right to assume that '<span class="accented">iddan</span>, "a time," means "a year;" it is really any defined time. Certainly it does approximate to the time during which the temple was polluted with heathen offerings; but it also coincides with equal accuracy to the campaigns of Vespasian and Titus against the Jews. Vespasian landed in Galilee in the beginning of A.D. , and Jerusalem fell on September 5, A.D. 70. There was thus, approximately, three years and a half occupied by this war. But "centuries" might also be meant. From the birth of our Lord, on whom the oppression was first exercised, till the accession of Constantine, was three centuries and a portion of a century. <span class="accented">The judgment shall sit.</span> Not necessarily the last judgment, but the evil that is being done comes before God for judgment. The taking away of the kingdom and dominion is immediately at the end of the period indicated by "a time and times and a dividing of time." The dominion was not taken away from Epiphanes then, nor from Vespasian; it did, however, pass from the heathenish empire when Constantine ascended the throne. At the same time, any such purely limited explanation is against the whole symbolic character of this vision. It is a period of time measured by "seven" <span class="accented">halves.</span> The times may receive their definition, not from the calendar, but from their spiritual import or dynamic content. The three years of our Lord's ministry is of more moment for the history of the race than all the millennia that preceded it.

The character of the chapter is like that which immediately precedes it. It consists, like it, of the account of a vision, and the interpretation of it. The subject of this vision is the overthrow of the Persian monarchy by Alexander the Great, the division of his empire, and the oppression of Israel by Epiphanes. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first</span>. The text of the Septuagint does not differ greatly from the Hebrew, but avoids the strange anarthrous position of <span class="accented">anu</span>, "I." The Septuagint renders this verse as a title to the chapter, thus: "A vision which I Daniel saw in the third year of the reign of Belshazzar (Beltasar), after that I saw formerly (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>)." The Septuagint reading seems to have been <span class="accented">asher r'oeh anee.</span> Theodotion and the Peshitta are in verbal agreement with the Massoretic text. The <span class="accented">third year of the reign of King Belshazzar.</span> We learn now that Belshazzar did not reign independently; but that for at least five years he exercised all the functions of government. If Daniel's investiture with the position of third man in the kingdom took place on the occasion of Belshazzar's inauguration of his vice-regal reign, Daniel may have remained in the royal service continuously till the overthrow of the Babylonian monarchy. <span class="accented">After that which appeared</span> ,<span class="accented">into me at the first.</span> The former vision referred to is clearly the vision of the preceding chapter. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a></div><div class="verse">And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I <i>was</i> at Shushan <i>in</i> the palace, which <i>is</i> in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2</span> <span class="cmt_word">- And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai</span>. The LXX. presents several slight differences, "And I saw in the vision of my dream, when I was in the city Susa, which is in the province Elymais, and I seemed in my vision to be at the gate Ailam." Theodotion renders more briefly, "And I was in Susa the palace (<span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), in the province Ailam, and I was on the Ubal." The Syriac is in close agreement with the Massoretic. even to the transcription of the doubtful word <span class="accented">Ubal.</span> The transcription is carried so far that <span class="accented">medeenatha</span>, "a city," is used to translate <span class="accented">m'deena</span>, "a province." Jerome renders <span class="accented">mdeena</span>, <span class="accented">cicitas</span>, and <span class="accented">uval</span>, <span class="accented">portam</span>, and <span class="accented">beera</span>, <span class="accented">castrum.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">oobal</span>) is nearly a <span class="accented">hapax legomenon</span>, absolutely so if we do not admit <span class="accented">joobal</span>, in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>, to be the same word. There is, as will have been seen above, great differences among the versions. The LXX. and Jerome seem to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">oolam</span>), "porch" or "gate," instead of <span class="accented">oobal.</span> Ewald would make the word mean "river-basin," <span class="accented">Stromgebeit</span> - a view supported also by Zockler. In many respects "marsh" might be a more suitable rendering. To the south-west of the present ruins of Susa there is an extensive marsh, which may have been of old date. The preposition <span class="accented">liphnee</span>, which occurs in ver. 3, is all but meaningless applied to a river, if we use it in its ordinary meaning, "before." If we take it as meaning "eastward," the ram would be "westward" from Shushan, <span class="accented">ie.</span> between Shushan and the river; but as Daniel was in Shushan, he would naturally state the position of the "ram" in relation to it rather than to the river. The preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">al</span>) is nearly as meaningless with regard to a river, unless a bridge or a boat is intended. We are inclined to read <span class="accented">oolam</span> as "porch." At the same time, we know that there was the river Ulai (Eulaeus) near Shushan. It is mentioned in one of the inscriptions of Asshurbanipal in connection with Shushan (Smith's 'Asshurbanipal,' p. 130). <span class="accented">The palace. B.C.era</span> really seems to mean "fortress." It occurs ten times in Esther, and always as the appellation of Shushan. In Nehemiah it is once used with this connotation, but twice in regard to some building in Jerusalem, probably the temple; in Chronicles it is used for the temple. In <a href="../../par/ezra/6-2.htm">Ezra 6:2</a> it is used of Achmetha, equivalent to Ecbatana. From the fact that the LXX. translates <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, it might be reasoned that the translator had <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> before him, but the translation probably was due to ignorance of the precise meaning of the word. In Esther this word is rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. In Nehemiah it is once rendered <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, once it is rendered <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, and once <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>. The derivation of the word seems to be from the <span class="cmt_word"></span> Assyrian <span class="accented">birtu.</span> It really means "citadel" or "fortress," and thus may be compared with the Carthaginian <span class="accented">byrsa.</span> Jerome's translation, <span class="accented">castrum</span>, suits this. It is not necessary to maintain that at this time Daniel was in Shushan. All that is implied is that in his dream he was there. Shushan is first referred to in the inscriptions of Asshur-bani-pal as the capital of Elam. In the history of that monarch there is an inscription of his given in which he says, "Shushan, the great city, the seat of their gods, the place of their oracle, I captured." Then follows a description of the plunder he took from it. We do not know when it recovered from that overthrow. The name is said to be derived from the number of lilies growing in the neighbourhood; but <span class="accented">shushan</span>, "a lily," is a Shemitie word, and the Elamites are usually regarded as an Aryan people. The association of Babylon with Elam and Media must have been intimate, if any credit is to be placed on the Greek accounts of the marriage of Nebuchadnezzar. Hence, even if Elam was not, at the date specified, a province of the Babylonian Empire, perhaps never was, yet the Babylonian. court might well have envoys visiting the court of Elam. We find from the well-known inscription of Nabunahid, that he regarded Cyrus at first as a friend and deliverer from the formidable Astyages, King of Umman-Manda. Daniel <span class="accented">may</span> have been sent to Elam, although there is no necessity for maintaining that this was the case. It was not until he had conquered Astyages that Cyrus held possession of Shushan.

"Eastward," which <span class="accented">liphnee</span> also means, will not suit the geographical circumstances, as Shushan itself stood on the east bank of the river Eulaeus, or Shapur. If, further, <span class="accented">oobal</span> means a "marsh," as Jerome renders it, then "eastward" would not suit. for the existing marsh is to the south-west of Shushan. Theodotion is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, but does not translate (<span class="accented">oobal</span>, he merely transliterates it. The Peshitta is in strict agreement with the text of the Massoretes. Jerome, as we just said. in this verse renders <span class="accented">oobal</span> by <span class="accented">paludem.</span> Daniel in his vision seems looking from the walls of the citadel of Shushan, most likely even now the capital of the triumphant young conqueror. The progress of the arms of Cyrus would no doubt be viewed with apprehension by the court of Babylon. Daniel's thoughts would be naturally filled with the new factor in the polities of the Euphrates valley. Hence it was not unnatural that the thoughts of the (lay should colour the visions of the night. The choice of the animal - the ram - to represent the Medo-Persian monarchy is by some supposed to be illustrated by the figures of goats and rams on Persian cylinders. If it has any special meaning, it probably is that the monarchy had sprung up among a pastoral people. It is maintained by Professor Bevan, that this figure of a ram with two horns proves that there were two successive empires  - a Median and a Persian. If Mr. Bevan would use his ingenuity, and show us any way by which the actual facts of the history and constitution of the Medo-Persian Empire could be represented in a symbol that would not be liable to his misinterpretation, it would be an advantage. The empire, we know, was built up by two races - the race which last came into prominence became the predominant. Here in the symbol before us the unity of the empire is exhibited by the animal being one, and the two races are indicated by the two horns. The duality of the symbol ought to be noted.

It is more important to note that in the LXX. we have the four points of the compass mentioned, not merely three as in the Massoretic, "I saw the ram butting eastward, and northward, and westward, and southward." Had <span class="accented">a falsarius</span> been wishful to supply the missing direction, he would have inserted "eastward" between "northward" and "southward," only if he had begun with "eastward" would he have gone on as it at present stands in the Septuagint. What could make him change "west" to "east"? Our opinion is that the LXX. represents the original text. It is confirmatory of this that Theodotion. in strict agreement with the text of the Massoretes, renders the first direction "seaward" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). The Peshitta renders "westward," not by <span class="accented">yammah</span>, but by the term for "west" that became common in Exilic and post-Exilic Hebrew, <span class="accented">ma'arab</span> - the  word that is used in the next verse. Ezekiel uses <span class="accented">yammah</span> for "west," when in vision he places himself in Palestine, otherwise it is not used for "west" by Exilic and post-Exilic writers. If we take the statement of the next verse as fixing what was "the west" to the author of Daniel, where would "seaward" be? If we draw a line from Tress, where Alexander landed, and continue it through Babylon, it reaches the Persian Gulf. "Seaward" would mean consequently "eastward," or approximately so, to one writing in Babylon. A great number of suggestions have been offered to explain the singular omission of "eastward" from the direction in which the ram pushes with his horns, Havernick, and following him Moses Stuart, assert that "eastward" is not mentioned because the Persians made no conquests to the east until the days of Darius Hystaspis, and then not permanent ones. Against this is the fact that Elam and Media were mainly east of Ansan. Further, the picture here given of the Persian Empire is not restricted to the days of Cyrus and Cambyses, but all through its course. As to the permanence of these Eastern conquests, the territories of Darius Codomannus east of Arbela embraced modern Persia and other territories to the confines of India. Keil assumes that the ram stands on the western bank of the Shapur, so, if he pushed eastward, it would be against his own capital; but if <span class="accented">oobal</span> means "a river," then the only meaning possible for <span class="accented">liphnee</span> is "eastward." He would then be butting towards the river across which the enemy was likely to come, moreover, against his own capital, unless the ram is supposed to be between the river and the city - an unlikely supposition, as Shushan was on the river Eulaeus. He further maintains that the unfolding of the power of Persia was towards these three named directions, and not towards the last, whatever that may mean. Ewald declares the ram does not butt towards the east, because that already belongs to him. As a matter of fact, and, as exhibited by the Book of Esther, welt known to the Jews, the Persian Empire did conquer towards the east. Behrmann says, "The ram does not push towards the east, because he comes from the east - a delicacy the Septuagint overlooked." In point of fact, there is no word in the vision of the ram coming from anywhere - this delicacy (<span class="accented">feinheit</span>) Professor Behrmann has overlooked. Kranich-fold and Zockler follow this. The view of Bishop Newton, followed by Archdeacon Rose, is that the east had no importance to the Jews; but north and south had just a little. Jephet-ihn-Ali and several modern commentators think the three directions, as the three ribs, imply the limitation of the Persian Empire. It certainly was recognized by the Jews to be little, if at all, less than that of Alexander the Great Hitzig propounds in all gravity an absurd view; he assumes that the ram was standing on the west bank of the river, and faced west, and argues that he did not butt eastward because he could not butt backwards. His preliminary assumption is groundless, as we have seen, and rams can change their position. The true explanation is that a direction has dropped out. While "<span class="accented">seaward"</span> had ceased to mean "west" to the Jews in Babylon, it did not take long residence in Palestine to recover this name for "west." A copyist living in Palestine, finding <span class="accented">yammah</span>, <span class="accented">in</span> the first place would translate it "westward;" then after "northward" he would, in the third place, come upon <span class="accented">ms'arab</span>, which also meant "<span class="accented">west</span>;" so naturally he dropped the second of what seemed <span class="accented">to</span> him synonymous terms. If we are correct in our supposition, we have here demonstrative proof that Daniel was written by one living in Babylon Are <span class="accented">beasts might stand before him.</span> All the powers round Persia had to submit to him. <span class="accented">And be became great</span> affords proof, if proof were needed, that the vision applies to the whole of the history of Persia. There is little necessity for Moses Stuart's translation, "became haughty."

The Septuagint, when completed from Paulus Tellensis, agrees in the main with the Massoretic, omitting only "whole" before "earth." The Christian MS. omits the clause, "and touched the ground," but it is in Paulus Tellensis. <span class="accented">As I was considering.</span> "Was" is here used much as an auxiliary verb - an Aramaic usage. "Considering" really suggests "meditating on." <span class="accented">He-goat.</span> The word here used does not elsewhere occur in the Hebrew Scriptures. It is really an Aramaic word, though vocalized here after the analogy of Hebrew. <span class="accented">On the face of the whole earth.</span> The writer had probably in his mind the negative idea expressed in the next verse; hence the word <span class="accented">kol. A notable horn</span>; "a horn of sight;" a horn that no one could fail to remark upon.  No symbol could express in a more graphic way the rapidity of the conquests of Alexander the Great than this of the goat that flew over the ground. One can parallel with this the four wings of the leopard in ch. 7. It is singular that Alexander should generally on his coins be figured as horned. Had this vision been due to a knowledge of this - which could not have escaped a Jew of the days of the Maccabees - the writer would certainly have made Alexander not a goat, but a ram. as it is a ram's horn that is intended to be figured on the portraits of Alexander. As everybody knows, this refers to the fable that he was the son of Jupiter Ammon, the ram-horned. It is difficult to assign a reason why the goat was chosen as the symbol of the Grecian power, save that, as compared with the Persian power, the Greek was the more agile.

The Massoretic, as the less obvious collocation, is the better reading. Theodotion and the Peshitta leave <span class="accented">oobal</span> untranslated. The latter omits the last clause of the Massoretic. In the Hebrew the ram is called <span class="accented">Baal-karnayeem</span>, "lord of two horns."

The two Greek versions, though differing very much in the Greek words chosen as equivalent to the Hebrew, yet both represent a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes. The Peshitta omits the introductory "behold," but otherwise can scarcely be said to differ essentially from the received text, though there are some peculiarities due to mistaken reading, but unimportant. The word <span class="accented">yithmormar</span>, "he was embittered," is a word that occurs here and in the eleventh chapter. The root, however, as might be guessed from its meaning, is not uncommon, being found in Genesis Exodus, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Ruth, Job, and Zechariah. How Professor Bevan can class this with "words or roots which occur nowhere else in the Old Testament" it is difficult to see. If this part of the verb occurs in later Jewish literature, it is singular that neither Buxtorf nor Levy chronicles the fact. It does not occur in Western Aramaic, but does in Eastern (comp. Peshitta <a href="../../par/2_samuel/18-33.htm">2 Samuel 18:33</a>; <a href="../../par/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16</a>). It is quite such a word as a man writing among those who spoke Eastern Aramaic might use. Alexander advanced always against Darius; he would not even speak of treating with him. After the passage of the Granicus, he pushed on to Cilicia, overthrew Darius at Issus, B.C.. 333; then, after the conquest of Egypt, advanced against him again at Arbela, and once more inflicted on him an overwhelming defeat. When Darius fled from the field, Alexander pursued him to the shores of the Caspian and into Bactria and Sogdiana, till Darius fell a victim to the treachery of Bessus. Certainly relentlessness was the most marked character of Alexander's pursuit of Darius. The horns of the Persian power were broken, thrown to the earth, and trodden underfoot.

The Peshitta agrees closely with the Massoretic. The Greek versions indicate that the reading they had before them was '"<span class="accented">haroth</span> instead of <span class="accented">hazooth</span>; <span class="accented">hazooth</span> has been borrowed from the fifth verse. The empire of Alexander had reached its greatest extent when the young conqueror fell a victim to what seems malarial fever, aggravated by his drinking. His life was broken off before its legitimate conclusion. At his death there was great confusion. Perdiccas assumed the guardianship of the children of the conqueror, and attempted to succeed him in the empire. After his death Antigonus in turn attempted to secure the imperial power, but was defeated and slain at the battle of Ipsus. The empire of Alexander was then divided into four main portions - Macedonia and Greece, under Cassander; Asia Minor, under Lysimachus; Syria and all the East, under Seleucus; and Cyrene, under Ptolemy. In the two first of these there were several revolutions, but finally the Antigonids established themselves in Macedon, and the Attalids in Asia Minor. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-9.htm">Daniel 8:9</a></div><div class="verse">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant <i>land</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east. and toward the pleasant land</span>. The Greek versions here differ considerably from the Massoretic text. The LXX. is as follows: "And out of one there sprang a strong horn, and it prevailed and smote toward the south, toward the south-west  (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), and toward the east, and toward the north." In this case, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is clearly a doublet - an alternative rendering that has got into the text from the margin. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;</span> results from reading <span class="accented">tzephonah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>) instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>). Theodotion renders, "From one of them went forth a strong horn, and was magnified exceedingly to the south and to the power" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), "host," for <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> It is to be observed that both translate <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> as "strong" (<span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>) instead of "little." The reason of this is that they have taken <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;</span> as equivalent to <span class="accented">ex</span>, therefore equivalent to a negative. The Peshitta agrees with the Authorized in reading <span class="accented">mitztzeeroth as</span> "little," but leaves out the difficult final word rendered "the pleasant land" in our Authorized Version. Jerome translates <span class="accented">mitztze'eeroth</span> by <span class="accented">modicum</span>, and <span class="accented">tzebee</span> by <span class="accented">fortitudinem</span> - a combination of Theodotion and the Massoretic; he must have had <span class="accented">tzaba</span> in his text instead of <span class="accented">tzebee</span>,  - this may have been due to the fact that <span class="accented">tzaba</span> occurs in the next verse. The reference is sufficiently obvious to Antiochus. The description is accurate; he sprang from one of the four horns or dynasties that succeeded the great conqueror. He carried his arms to the east, but mainly to the south against Egypt. The great difficulties are in the two Hebrew words <span class="accented">mitztz"</span><span class="accented">eeroth</span> and <span class="accented">tzebee.</span> As to the first word, the fact that the two Greek versions have read it are conclusive against the suggestion of Gratz and Hitzig, supported by Bevan, that we should omit <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>. (<span class="accented">min</span>). Jephet-ibn-Ali takes <span class="accented">min</span> as denoting the origin of the horn, "from a little one." The further suggestion of Gratz, that we should adopt the reading of the LXX., is rightly combatted by Professor Bevan. The readings alike of the LXX. and Theodotion could have sprung from the Massoretic reading, whereas neither of these could so readily be the original reading. It was necessary that Israel should be prominent in this part of the prophecy; it all leads up to the persecution the Jews endured at the hands of Epiphanes. It is necessary, then, to hold that this word, whatever reading we adopt, and whatever immediate meaning we assign to it, must refer to Palestine. Ewald renders it "ornament;" Bevan, "glory." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-10.htm">Daniel 8:10</a></div><div class="verse">And it waxed great, <i>even</i> to the host of heaven; and it cast down <i>some</i> of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</span> The reading of the LXX. is very different after the first clause, "And it was exalted to the stars of heaven, and it was shattered to the earth by thestars, and by them trampled down." The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">tappayl</span>) translated "cast down," has been read as if it had been <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">tooppal</span>). So too the last verb has evidently been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">vayyir'msoohoo</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">vattir'msaym</span>), due to the resemblance which there was between <span class="accented">yod</span> and tan in the older script. Theodotion differs hardly less from the Massoretic, "And it was magnified to the power of heaven, and it fell to the earth from the power of heaven and from the stars, and they trode them down." The verb translated "fell" is evidently read with a vocalization different from both the Massoretic and the LXX The sense of Theodotion is more in accordance with the Septuagint than with the Massoretic. The Peshitta and the Vulgate agree with the Massoretic. The question of which reading is to be preferred can scarcely be settled without regarding the meaning of the terms here used. The crucial point is - What is the meaning of the "host of heaven"? The general consensus of interpreters is that this refers to Israel. Some maintain that the best of heaven is Israel, and the stars their leaders (Glassins); the stars are the Levites (Grotius). Moses Stuart would hold the host to be the priests, and the stars the teachers. Kliefoth is right in commencing first with the picture, and requiring that it be realized in thought. The horn grows and grows before Daniel's gaze, until it seems to touch the stars, that is, the host of heaven. As to what is meant by the stars, we must look elsewhere for an explanation. Have we any right to take "the host of heaven" as meaning the people of God? The phrase, "host of heaven," occurs elsewhere in Scripture nearly a score of times, and it rover means anything else than the stars or the angels. Therefore all interpretations that make this mean either the people of God or the Levites, must be thrown aside. It may, however, mean the people of God mediately. A quite elaborate line of deduction has been brought forward - the promise to Abraham (<a href="../../par/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), to Isaac (<a href="../../par/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>), that their seed should be as the stars of heaven, is brought into connection with the use of the word "hosts" in regard to Israel (<a href="../../par/numbers/1-52.htm">Numbers 1:52</a>, etc.) - and the title given to God as the God of Israel, "Jehovah of hosts." This is very ingenious, but it has no support from scriptural usage or from the usage in apocalyptic writings. In the Book of Enoch, which, since it is modelled on this book, furnishes us with the earliest commentary on it, we find the stars are invariably the symbol of the angels. When we pass to the Book of Revelation, we find the same thing. We find when we pass on to the tenth chapter of this book, that all the nations are regarded as under the rule of some special angel We must apply, so far  as we can, rules of interpretation which the author himself supplies us with. Using this guide, we see next that, when a nation was defeated and oppressed, its angel or star was regarded as thrown to the earth and trodden underfoot. The treatment Epiphanes meted out to Egypt and Palestine seems specially referred to. If we take the reading of the LXX., then the reference will be to the humiliation Epiphanes received at the hands of the Romans first, and then the Jews, and lastly the Elamites, whose temple he attempted to plunder.

There is a difference here between the Q'ri and the K'thib. The latter reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, while the former reads <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal of the same verb At first sight the difficulty is not lessened by consideration of the versions. The Septuagint as it at present stands is utterly unintelligible, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and by him everlasting mountains were broken down, and their place and sacrifice taken away, and he placed it in the very ground, and he prospered [reading with Syriac] and was, and the holy place shall be laid waste." This confusion is due to confluence of readings, and is not difficult to disentangle with the help of the Massoretic text. Up to the last two words the Septuagint is a translation of a text differing from the Massoretic simply by intelligible variations and repetitions not uncommon in the Septuagint. The first clause of the LXX. originally was probably, "Till the prince shall deliver the captivity," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">shebee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (tzaba) - a scribe, finding <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span> in his Hebrew, then added the translation of it to the margin of his Greek copy, from which it got into the text. The original of the LXX. had also <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">yatztzeel</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">hig'deel</span>) - a confusion easily made in the elder script, in which <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;</span> and <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;</span> were like. We learn from the Talmud (<span class="accented">Shabb.</span>, 103b) that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;</span> was liable to be mistaken by scribes for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;</span>. Moreover, "captivity" would naturally suggest <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e6;&#x5dc;</span>, "<span class="accented">to deliver."</span> The second clause is, "By him the everlasting mountains were broken down." Here <span class="accented">hayreem</span> has been read with the K'thib, and vocalized as if it were <span class="accented">hareem</span>, and <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "continual," translated as equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5dd;</span> ('<span class="accented">olam</span>), "everlasting." The next clause reveals the other meaning of <span class="accented">tameed</span>, "sacrifice," which probably had been written on the margin, and then dropped into the text. The latter part of the Septuagint verse appears to be confused with the latter part of the following verse according to the Massoretes. Theodotion is even less intelligible than the Septuagint, "Until the leader of the host shall save the captivity, and through him the sacrifice was broken down, and he prospered, and the holy place shall be made desolate." It is to be noticed that the first clause here agrees with the LXX. It is possible that "and he prospered" is a doublet, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> being read for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in some copy. The Peshitta differs from beth the Greek versions, "Until it arrive to the chiefs of the host, and by it was set up in perpetuity, and preparing he strengthened the sanctuary," and while it is difficult to understand the origin of the variation in the first clause, it is clear that in the second clause the translator must have read <span class="accented">hish-leem</span> for <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> The one thing that seems clear is that the reading of the K'thib is to be preferred. We should read <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, not <span class="accented">hooram.</span> Only the first of these could be read "mountains." If we translate the words as they stand, we shall certainly be removed out of the region of all the commentators. It is assumed that "the little horn" is the subject of this sentence; but "horn" is feminine in Hebrew, and the verbs here are in the masculine; this is against it being the nominative. The "prince of the host," then, must be the nominative of the verbs and subject of the sentence. The rendering of the first clause ought to be, then, "Until the prince of the host magnify himself (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/12-24.htm">1 Samuel 12:24</a>), and by himself he shall offer the daily sacrifice. And he shall cast down the foundation of his holy place," reading <span class="accented">hishlayk instead</span> of <span class="accented">hooshlak.</span> We should feel strongly in. clined to transfer the first "and" to <span class="accented">hayreem</span>, and, changing the punctuation, read, "Until the prince of the host shall make himself greater than he" - viz, the tyrant represented by "the little horn" - "and shall offer the daily sacrifice." If we might read <span class="accented">hishleem</span> with the Peshitta instead of <span class="accented">hoosh-lak</span>, we get a satisfactory meaning to the last clause, in which case we should render, "He shall complete the place of his sanctuary." We would understand by "complete," "to perfectly purify." Taking the Massoretic text thus with little modification, we have a description of the successes of Judas Maccabseus, who was prince of the host, and as such became stronger than Epiphanes, and then cleansed the temple, and offered the continual daily sacrifice. We give, as a curiosity, the note of Saadiah Gaon: "The King of Ishmael was more powerful than the kings of Rome who had  Jerusalem, and he took Jerusalem from them by force." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a></div><div class="verse">And an host was given <i>him</i> against the daily <i>sacrifice</i> by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and prospered.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised, and</span> <span class="cmt_word">prospered.</span> The renderings of the LXX. and Theodotion are closely related, and both differ from the Massoretic text. The first is, "And the sins were upon the sacrifice, and righteousness was fallen to the earth, and he (or, it) did, and prospered." Theodotion renders, "And sin was placed (given) upon the sacrifice, and righteousness is fallen to the earth, and he (it) did and prospered." The Peshitta is nearer the Massoretic text, but better in accordance with the Authorized Version, "A host was given against the perpetuity, in transgression the holy place was thrown to the ground, and he did and prospered." From the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>) is omitted from the two Greek versions, we venture to omit it also; it has probably been inserted from the verse above. Both versions also omit the preposition before" transgression;" we omit it also. We would thus render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice, and," reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, "truth was cast to the ground, and it did and prospered." After Judas Maccabaeus had cleansed the temple and offered sacrifices, sin mingled with it. We know that the stricter <span class="accented">Hasidim</span>, objected to the foreign alliances into which the Maccabees were inclined to enter; the battle of Beth-zecharias was largely lost by the abstention of the stricter party. After that, Lysias, representing really the same movement as Epiphanes, advanced to the capture of Bethshur. Thus it might be said of the little horn, that "it did and prospered." Were it not that there is no authority for it in the versions, we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>. In that ease we should render, "And transgression was upon the sacrifice" - regarding this sacrifice as the atonement for the transgression (<a href="../../par/leviticus/16-21.htm">Leviticus 16:21</a>) - "and truth shall make peace in the land, and do and prosper."

The versions leave <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, "a certain one," untranslated. Fust's suggestion, held also by Behrmann, is that this is a contraction for <span class="accented">paloni almoni.</span> The renderings of the versions are worthy of note. The LXX., "And I heard one holy one speaking, and another holy one said to Phehnouni who spoke, How long shall the vision stand, and the removed sacrifice, and the sin of desolation given, and the holy place be desolate to be trodden underfoot (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">?"</span> Here the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "shall stand," is supposed by Professor Bevan to be an addition by one who did not fully comprehend the sentence. Following Gratz, Professor Bevan suggests a word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">mooram</span>), "removed," to explain the presence of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> - <span class="accented">a</span> suggestion that appears well-founded. His further suggestion, that <span class="accented">sim</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>), "to set up," has been read instead of <span class="accented">shomaym</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>), must be due to inattention to the Greek. In it there is nothing about "set up," unless he transfers <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> from its place in the beginning of the sentence to the middle, and changes it to the active voice. Equally extraordinary is the suggestion that the translators read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>, instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5d1;&#x5d0;</span>. The truth is, the introduction of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is probably due to a gloss or a confluence of readings. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Septuagint, save in the last clause, which he renders, "And the sanctuary and the power be trodden underfoot." The Peshitta is closer to the Massoretic, "And I heard a holy one who spake, and a holy one said to <span class="accented">palmoni</span>, who spake, When shall the vision of the perpetuity (daily sacrifice?), and of sin and of corruption be completed, and the holy place and the host be trodden underfoot?" The translators must have read <span class="accented">shahata</span> instead of <span class="accented">shomaym.</span> "Completed," <span class="accented">nesh-tlem</span>, may have been added, as <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in the Greek, but the fact that all the versions have a word not represented in the Massoretic would indicate the probability that something has dropped out. Some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Greek Version, whereas some portion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> is suggested by the Peshitta. Daniel hears one of those watching angels who desire to look into the evolution of the Divine purpose concerning man and his salvation, asking another, "How long shall be the desolation of Jerusalem under Epiphanes?" The irregular construction here suggests corruption. We would render the speech of the angel, "How long - the vision, the sacrifice - the sin of desolation to give the sanctuary and the service to be trodden underfoot?" as if Daniel had only heard snatches of what was said; we would, we may say, omit the "and" before "sanctuary." The Septuagint translators may have omitted <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">tzaba</span>), thinking only of its ordinary meaning, "host," forgetful of the fact that it is used of the temple service in <a href="../../par/numbers/4-23.htm">Numbers 4:23</a>. These angels  are most interested in the length of time that the sanctuary shall remain desolate. This may indicate that it was evident, from the vision, that the period of desolation was a limited one. The scene presented to the imagination is striking. The seer, as he gazes on the vision appearing to him over the marsh at Susa, hears angelic voices that direct attention to what was most important to him and to his people. To the Israelites of the period of the Maccabees, the length of time that the temple service would be in abeyance was of the highest importance. It was well that they should know that the time was shortened for the elect's sake. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-14.htm">Daniel 8:14</a></div><div class="verse">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed</span>. The Massoretic reading is here clearly corrupt. "Unto me" ought to be "unto him," as proved by the versions and necessitated by sense. The LXX. is somewhat violent in construction, but means, "And he said to him, Until evenings and mornings are two thousand three hundred days, and the sanctuary shall be purified." Theodotion agrees closely with the LXX., only he has "five hundred" instead of "three hundred." The Peshitta agrees with the Massoretic, save as above mentioned - "him" instead of "me," and the last clause, which ought naturally to rendered "and the sacrifice be purified." The Hebrew phrase for this clause is an unnatural one - it might be rendered, "And holiness (or, 'holy thing,' 'offering') shall be justified." The want of the article is not an objection, as the manner of the author is to use the article sparingly. The word translated "cleansed" really means "justified;" it is the only example of this part of the verb. All the versions translate as if the word had been some derivative of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">tahar</span>). The period referred to is that between the desolation inflicted on the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes and its cleansing by Judas Maccabaeus. It is somewhat difficult to fix the exact space of time intended by these two thousand three hundred evening-mornings. Does it mean two thousand three hundred days? For this may be urged that this succession. "evening and morning," not "morning and evening," resembles <a href="../../par/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>. If this resemblance is intentional, then "evening-morning" means a space of twenty-four hours. If the days are literal days, then the space of time would amount to nearly six years and a half, if' we take the year here as three hundred and sixty days. Another view is that day and night are separated and each reckoned; hence the number of days involved would be eleven hundred and fifty - fifty-five days more than three average years, and seventy days more than three years of three hundred and sixty days each. If, however, the year be the lunar year of three hundred and fifty-four days, it closely approximates to three years and a quarter. The period that one would naturally think of is that between the setting up of the abomination of desolation (1 Macc. 1:54), on the fifteenth day of Casleu, in the hundred and forty-fifth year of the Seleucid era to the rededication of the temple on the twenty-fifth of Casleu, in the hundred and forty-eighth year (from  <span class="date">B.C. 167</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 164</span>), but that is only three years and ten days. If the first and last of these years were respectively the fifth and seventh of a metonic cycle, in each of which there were intercalary months, then there is only a difference of eighteen days between the interval given above and the actual historical interval. If, however, we are to believe Maerobius ('Satur.,' 1:13, &sect; 9), and hold that the intercalations were supplied by adding the three months in one year, if one of the years in question was the year in the cycle in which this took place, then the interval would be twelve days too much. In either case the difference is very small. The attempt to take the interval as two thousand three hundred days leads to very arbitrary results. Behrmann takes the victory of Adasa, which Judas gained over Nicanor, as the termination of the period - a purely arbitrary date, and reckons back to the displacement of Onias, another date that, so far as can be seen, was not regarded as of importance by the Jews, however important it has become in the eye of critics. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-15.htm">Daniel 8:15</a></div><div class="verse">And it came to pass, when I, <i>even</i> I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</span> The versions here are unimportant. Daniel desires to understand the meaning of this vision. From this we see that, at the time when this book was written, it was understood that prophets might be ignorant of the meaning of the revelations made to them. This is at variance with the assumption of even believing critics, that if a prophecy were given to a prophet, he must have understood the reference of the message. On the accuracy of this assumption, they found the rejection of any interpretation of a prophecy which sees more in it than the prophet could have seen. This latest critical date of Daniel is separated by approximately two centuries and a half from prophecy in actual existence in Malachi. The tradition of the conditions of the phenomenon would still be vital. The phrase before us probably means that Daniel applied the various Babylonian formulae to the dream, to find the interpretation , but, suspicious of them, he still continued his search. In answer to Daniel's search, there stood before him one having "the appearance of a man (<span class="accented">gaber</span>)" - an angelic being in human form. The H,.brew word translated "man" is <span class="accented">gaber</span>, which suggests the name given to the angel, "Gabriel." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a></div><div class="verse">And I heard a man's voice between <i>the banks of</i> Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this <i>man</i> to understand the vision.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I heard a man's voice between the hanks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision</span>. The Septuagint has an addition, "And the man called out, saying, To that purpose is the <span class="accented">vision."</span> This seems to be a gloss. Theodotion and the Peshita agree with the Massoretic, only that Theodotion does not indicate the difference of the word used for "man" in this verse from that in ver 15, and renders Ulai "<span class="accented">Oubeh"</span> "<span class="accented">Between</span> Ulai" is a singular phrase. The versions do not attempt any solution. The preposition <span class="accented">bayin</span> means usually "between." If we assume that the river Ulai is here meant, and that it divided into two branches, the thing is explicable. Only it would have been more in accordance with usage to have put "Ulai" in the plural. It may, perhaps refer to the marsh, in which case it might be between the citadel and the marsh. Daniel had seen the appearance of a man; now he hears a voice addressing the man, and naming him <span class="accented">Gabriel</span>, "Hero of God." It is to be noted that this is the earliest instance of the naming of angels in Scripture. In the tenth chapter Michael is also named. These are the only angelic names in the whole of Scripture. These two names, and these alone, recur in the New Testament, the first of them in the first chapter of Luke, and the second in <a href="../../par/revelation/12-7.htm">Revelation 12:7</a> and Jude. The Book of Tobit added another angelic name on the same lines, Raphael. When we <span class="accented">pass</span> to the Books of Enoch, we have moat elaborate hierarchies of angels, in all of which, however much they may otherwise differ, occur the two angels mentioned here and Raphael. The difference in atmosphere between the elaborate angelology of Enoch and the reticent accounts in the book before us is great. It is hardly possible to imagine so great a difference between the works of men that were all but contemporaries. The function assigned to Gabriel here is in accordance with that he fulfils in the New Testament - he is to make Daniel "understand the vision."

In the first place, <a href="../../par/daniel/7-15.htm">Daniel 7:15</a> <span class="accented">shows</span> that Daniel had been grieved and disturbed before he ventured on the question; and, next, Gabriel was one of the great angels that stood before God.

It is rather to be rendered, after the analogy of <a href="../../par/jeremiah/50-26.htm">Jeremiah 50:26</a>, where <span class="accented">miqqetz</span> means "from the utmost border," and reaches to a far-off time.

The LXX. joins the opening words of the next verse to this. <span class="accented">I was in a deep sleep suggests</span> the case of the three apostles, Peter, James, and John, on the Mount of Transfiguration (Luke 9:82).

It reads, "on the children of thy people." It may have been inserted from <a href="../../par/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, only it is used in such a different sense that that does not seem very likely. It may have been in the original text, and dropped out not unlikely by <span class="accented">homoioteleuton.</span> The missing clause would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;</span>, the last word of which is like two. On the other hand, its omission from Theodotion and the Peshitta is not so easily intelligible. Theodotion is in close agreement with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta is more brief, practically omitting the last clause. We have here the reference to the end, as in ver. 17 it is not the end of the world that is in the mind of the writer, but the "end of the indignation." The Jews, while maintaining their gallant struggle against Epiphanes, have need of being assured that the battle will have an end, and one determined before by God, The angel has to make Daniel know the end of the indignation. It may be said  that the present time, when Israel has neither country nor city, is one of indignation; but the immediate reference is to the persecution against the Jews inaugurated by Epiphanes.

Possibly this may be a survival of that usage. In this case the change is due to scribal blunder. When we turn to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-25.htm">Jeremiah 25:25</a> and Jeremiah 51:11, 58, we have the same phrases used as here: this is probably the origin of the blunder. For any one to ground an argument, as does Professor Bevan, on this, and maintain that it proves the writer to have held that there were two separate empires - one of Media, and the other of Persia - is absurd. When the true reading is adopted, this passage proves the very reverse of that for which Professor Bevan contends. The reasoning of Kliefoth, that the distinction between plural and singular points to the fact that, while several kings reigned ever the Persian Empire, only one ruled over the Greek, is very ingenious, but, unfortunately, it has no foundation in fact. "King," it may be observed, stands for dynasty, only that in the crisis of history, when the two powers encountered, each was ruled and represented by one king - Persia by Darius Codomannus, and Greece by Alexander.

Again all the versions agree in omitting the word "rough," and in inserting "of the goats," as in the fifth verse. The authority of these is much too great to be resisted. The Massoretic reading is probably due to a confluence of readings, as the word translated "rough" also means "goats." The omission of the word "of the goats" is probably due to the inclusion of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">sa'eer</span>).

In this variation we find also Theodotion and the Peshitta agreeing. Jerome has "<span class="accented">ejus."</span> It is difficult to decide what is the true reading here. In the reading of the older versions the meaning is that these kings which should succeed Alexander should not be mighty. The reading of the Massoretic and Jerome implies a direct and natural comparison with Alexander the Great. As for the Greek versions, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is easily mistaken for <span class="greek">&#x3c9;</span> in uncial manuscripts. As for the Syriac,  is apt to be added to of the third person, and produce the difference we find. While the Greek versions and Jerome render, "his nation" instead of "the nation," as in the Massoretic, the Peshitta follows the Massoretic , which is wrong here. The point of the contrast is that the kings that succeeded Alexander were not of his family. Certainly none of the <span class="accented">successors</span> of Alexander had an empire nearly so extensive as his. The only one that really even comes into comparison with the empire of Alexander is that of Seleucus Nicator. But not only had he neither European nor African dominions, he did not possess, save for a little while. Asia Minor, nor Palestine, nor India beyond the Indus at all. The Parthian Empire seen sprang up, and wrested from the Solenoid a large portion of their possessions east of the Euphrates. It can well be said, even of the empire of Seleucus, that it had not the power of that of Alexander the Great. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a></div><div class="verse">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.</span> The versions here are, on the whole, in agreement with the Massoretic. The Greek versions read, "their sins," as if it were the iniquities of the successors of Alexander that had become full, and thus afforded the occasion of the appearance of Epiphanes. The Peshitta and Jerome have "iniquities" generally, without reference to the kings, but with probable reference to the Jewish people. The probability is decidedly in favour of the Massoretic reading; it was an easy suggestion that the iniquities to be punished were those of the heathen kings. The whole analogy of Scripture leads us to look at the iniquity of the people of God being the cause of evil befalling them. Certainly immediately before the persecution inflicted on the <span class="accented">Jews</span> by Antiochus, the progress of the unbelieving Hellenizing party had been very great, as we see by 1 Macc. 1:13-16. It was "like people, like priest;" the people devoted themselves to Grecian games with all their heathen associations, and strove to hide their Hebrew origin and the covenant of their faith, and high priests were ready  to abet their practices. <span class="accented">A king of fierce countenance</span>; "<span class="accented">strong</span> of countenance." This refers to courage and success in war. Thus Amaziah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8</a>), when he wishes to challenge Joash King of Israel, desires to "look in his face." Epiphanes' countenance was one that could successfully stand a hostile meeting. The Greek versions render <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5e6;</span> ('<span class="accented">az</span>) by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "reckless." <span class="accented">Understanding dark sentences.</span> There may be some reference to incantations and superstitious observances; it may mean that he was well acquainted with omens, and how to benefit by them. Regardlessness in the matter of religion was a prominent characteristic of Antiochus; but it is quite a possible thing that, like most irreligious men, he was superstitious. He certainly was very keen-sighted in observing the political signs of the times, and very adroit at availing himself of what made for his own advantage. This last is the interpretation of Ewald. Zockler and Hitzig think it means that the king here pictured "will be cunning to hide his own designs from friend and foe." Yet more common is the view of Keil, Behrmann, Stuart, and Bevan, that it refers generally to his mastery in the use of artifice. The main difficulty in regard to this view is that usage, does not support assigning such a meaning to <span class="accented">heedoth.</span> On the other hand, when we bear in mind that here we have the language of symbol and prophecy, so tricks of strategy and chicane of policy may all be symbolized by "dark sayings," without necessary reference to <span class="accented">sentences</span> such as those with which the Queen of Sheba tested the wisdom of Solomon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a></div><div class="verse">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the holy people.</span> This verse involves many difficulties, grammatical and exegetical. These difficulties may be said to be present in all the versions of this passage. The LXX. renders, "And his power shall be confirmed, and not in his strength, and he shall destroy marvellously, and prosper and do, and shall destroy the rulers and people of the saints." Theodotion is so far slavishly close to the Massoretic text; but he seems to have read <span class="accented">qodesh</span>, an adjective agreeing with "<span class="accented">people</span>," instead of <span class="accented">qedosheem</span>, "<span class="accented">saints</span>;" and he omits the negative clause. The Peshitta is very close to the Massoretic. It emphasizes the negative clause by adding <span class="accented">denaphsho</span>, and translates "<span class="accented">wonders"</span> instead of "wonderfully." Jerome, more intent on expressing what is his own interpretation of the passage than on representing- the original, translates the first <span class="accented">heel</span> ("power") by <span class="accented">fortitude</span>, and the second by <span class="accented">viribus suis.</span> That the power of Epiphanes was great - greater than that of his brother and immediate predecessor - is undoubted. It is also the ease that he was confirmed in his place by the Romans, though, if we are to receive the account of Appian, the direct means of his elevation to the throne was the intervention of Eumenes of Pergamus on his behalf. Thus the reference of the phrase, "not by his own power," may be to this. Little as he might brook the thought, he was but a subject-ally of the great republic. The other interpretations are <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of Theodoret. Keil, Fuller, Havernick. Kranichfeld. and Moses Stuart, that the reference here is to Divine power as setting up Epiphanes to be a scourge to his people; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that of von Lengerke, Kliefoth, Bevan, Behrmann, etc., not by might, but by his cunning; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> that of Hitzig, which combines the two - his cunning is divinely given; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> that of Calvin and Ewald, that the contrast is with the might of Alexander the Great. All of these have something to favour them, but also something against them. There is against the first that there is no reference in the context to the fact, true though it was, that Antiochus was raised up by God for his own purposes. Against the second is the pronominal suffix, which would be needless if the contrast were between force and fraud. Of course, Hitzig's combination falls with this. Against the view advocated by Calvin and Ewald is the fact that it seems a long time to hold the reference to Alexander in abeyance. Still, it may be urged that the vision was before the prophet; on the other hand, the relative strength of Epiphanes and Alexander does not seem to be of importance. We still think that the real reference is to the fact that he did not attain the throne either by inheritance or by his own prowess, but by the help and authority of others, namely, Eumencs and Rome. <span class="accented">And he shall destroy wonderfully.</span> Gratz thinks <span class="accented">yasheeth</span>, "destroy," suspicious, and Professor Bevan suggests <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;</span>, (<span class="accented">yaseeh</span>), and would render, "He shall utter monstrous things;" but, unfortunately for his view, there is no hint in the versions of any difficulty as to the reading, and, further, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">sooh</span>) does not mean "<span class="accented">utter</span>," but "meditate." We must take the words as they stand (comp. <a href="../../par/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19</a>), and translate, "He shall destroy portentously." Certainly Epiphanes was to the Jews a portent of destruction; there had not been his like - not Nebuchadnezzar, who burned the temple, was to be compared to him who endeavoured to blot out the worship of Jehovah altogether: not any other of the Greek monarchs. He was unique in his enmity against God and his worship. <span class="accented">He</span>  <span class="accented">shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.</span> The rendering of the Revised Version better conveys the sense of the original, "He shall destroy the mighty ones." There has been discussion as to the distinction involved here. Ewald regards the mighty as the three other horns of the ten (<a href="../../par/daniel/7-8.htm">Daniel 7:8</a>) - an interpretation which proceeds in the false identification of the fourth beast with the Greek Empire. Rashi imagines the star-worshippers; this seems the height of caprice. Jephet-ibn-Ali, who identifies the little horn with Mahommed, holds the "mighty" to be the Romans. Keil and Fuller hold it to be the heathen rulers generally. Von Lengerke, Kliefoth, and others maintain it refers to the rich of the holy people, while <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">am</span>) are the poor. Hitzig refers it to the three claimants for the crown, whom Antiochus is alleged, on somewhat insufficient evidence, to have overthrown; Behrmann and Zockler, to the political and warlike enemies of Epiphanes, in contrast to the holy people, who were unwarlike. Kranichfeld refers it to the rulers of Israel, as distinct from the people; Calvin to "neighbouring nations." Moses Stuart would render, "great numbers, even the people of the saints;" while Professor Bevan thinks there is an interpolation here, and adopts a reading of Gratz from the LXX. for the beginning of the following verse. On the whole, this seems the best solution of the difficulty. After Epiphanes had destroyed the "mighty," that is to say, the political enemies he had, the Egyptians, etc., he directed his mind the "people of the saints." 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a></div><div class="verse">And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify <i>himself</i> in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken</span> <span class="cmt_word">without hand.</span> The versions here are at variance with each other and. with the Massoretic recension. The LXX. renders, "And against the saints shall his purpose be" - evidently reading, as suggested by Gratz, <span class="accented">v'al qedosheem siklo</span> - "and craft shall prosper in his hands, and his heart shall be lifted up, and by treachery he shall destroy many, and for the destruction of men shall he stand, and he shall make a gathering of power, and shall sell (it)." Theodotion is, in regard to the first clause, considerably more at variance with the Massorctic, "And the yoke of his collar (or chain) shall prosper." Evidently Theodotion had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> (<span class="accented">ol</span>), "yoke," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('<span class="accented">al</span>), "upon," and probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">sib'lo</span>), "his burden," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">sik'lo</span>), "his thought." "And in his heart he shall be magnified, and by treachery shall he corrupt many. and for the destruction of many. shall he stand, and as eggs shall he crush (them) in his hand," reading <span class="accented">k'baytzeem b'yad yishbar</span> instead of <span class="accented">be'eseph yad yishahabayr.</span> The Peshitta has several points of peculiarity, "And in his might he shall prosper: he shall restrain with his hand, and his heart shall be lifted up, and by treachery shall he corrupt many. and against the Ruler of rulers shall he rise up, and with grasp of the hand shall be taken." Even Jerome,. who is usually in close agreement with the Massoretic text, translates at variance with their pointing. He begins this verse really with the last clause of the previous one, "And he shall slay strong ones and the people of the saints according to his will, and treachery shall be directed in his hand, and in plenty of all things he shall slay many, and against the Prince of princes shall he rise, and without hand shall be broken." The most singular thing is the omission by both the Greek versions of the phrase <span class="accented">sar sareem</span>, which both appear to have read <span class="accented">yishhat rabbeem</span> a variation of reading difficult to understand. On the whole, these varying versions seem to have sprung from a text originally not differing much from the Massoretic, save in the opening clause, in which the Septuagint appears to suit the succession of thought better. The return of Antiochus from his expedition to Egypt was the signal for his persecution of the saints; then his "purpose, was against the holy people." <span class="accented">Craft shall prosper in his hand.</span> The account we have in the First Book of the Maccabees shows the perpetual exercise by Antiochus and those under him of treachery. At first, at all events, his craft prospered (1 Macc. 1:30). <span class="accented">And he shall magnify himself in his heart.</span> Bevan thinks this hardly accurate, as the hiphil is ordinarily causative. Only <a href="../../par/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a> has this verb used in hiphil as reflexive. The sense, however, seems to be, not that he shall become proud, but that he has many great projects in his mind one (1 Macc. 1:42) being to unify all the various peoples that were under his sceptre, so that they should be one in religion and law. He further had the design of conquering Egypt and uniting it to his empire, and would have done so had the Romans not intervened. <span class="accented">And by peace shall destroy many.</span> The word translated "peace" means also "<span class="accented">suddenly."</span> The Greek versions both render it by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>. Schleusner suggests that the word was derived from another root. There dues not seem such a root in Levy. The probability is that the meaning passed from "tranquillity" to the notion of "treachery." The meaning assigned to the word by Jerome is inexplicable, <span class="accented">copia rerum.</span> It happens that both the meaning attached to the word <span class="accented">shalvah</span> by the Greek versions here, and that found in other passages, harmonize. The treachery of the chief collector of tribute lay in feigning peace, and then slaying the people (1 Macc. 1:29). <span class="accented">He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes.</span> The Greek versions, as above observed, have instead of this, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - a phrase that might be a rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5d1;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. The Massoretic text here seems the preferable. Antiochus had certainly risen up against God, the "Prince of princes," or, as the Peshitta renders, "Ruler of rulers." <span class="accented">He shall be broken without hand.</span> The fact of Antiochus dying immediately after an ineffectual attempt to rob a temple in Elymais, and dying, not from the effect of wounds received, but from chagrin, is symbolized by this statement. The figure of a horn pushing in this direction and in that is resumed; hence Epiphanes is said to be broken. And that he was not overthrown in battle by any rival for the crown is shown by the statement that it was without hands that he was so broken. The Romans resisted his attempt to take <span class="accented">possession</span> of Egypt, so he was baulked in his pursuit after one object. He desired to unite his whole multifarious empire, so that it should be homogeneous; that was baulked by the victorious revolt of the Jews under Judas Maccabaeus. If he could have made his empire homogeneous, he might have expected to be able to defy the Romans. The defeat of his army by Judas might easily be remedied if he had money to pay his troops, so he attempted the plunder of the temple in Elymais, said to be that of Artemis. The inhabitants resisted so vehemently, that he had to retire baffled. This it was that caused his death. Polybius hints at madness inflicted by a Divine hand. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a></div><div class="verse">And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told <i>is</i> true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it <i>shall be</i> for many days.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word"></span>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. The rendering of the LXX. here is, "The vision of the evening and morning was found true, and the vision has been secured for many days." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">asher ne'emar</span>) has been read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5de;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;</span>, although it is difficult to see the genesis of such a reading from the Massoretic , or <span class="accented">vice versa.</span> The LXX. rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> ought to be observed - not "shut up," in the sense of being "sealed," but "defended from interference by being secured as with a hedge." Theodotion and the Peshitta agree with the Massoretic text, but have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>, construct of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">The vision of the evening and the morning</span> refers to ver. 14. The phrase used. here differs by the insertion of the definite article: but this merely intimates a reference. This statement does not mean that the period indicated by the two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings would end with the death of Antiochus. Certainly, his death occurred in the year following the cleansing of the temple (1 Macc. 6:16). If the writer reckons the beginning of the year according to the Macedonian Calendar, almost a year must have elapsed between the temple-cleansing and the death of Antiochus; but it is the cleansing that is the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span>, not the death of Antiochus. The pollution of the temple was the event that, of all others, would be trying to the faith and patience of Jewish believers; therefore attention is directed to this. As the beginning of this season of trial is the point to which the whole history of the Greek Empire travels, so the termination of this desecration is the end contemplated. <span class="accented">Shut thou up the vision.</span> Certainly the verb <span class="accented">satham</span> means sometimes "to hide;" and it is also certain that it is a characteristic of apocalyptic literature to contain, in the text, elaborate directions fur hiding the vision; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> the Apocalypse of Moses. It has been argued that this is a preparation for the publication of Daniel in the age of the Maccabees, so long after the date at which it purports to be written. But there is no description of how the book is to be hidden, as in the <span class="accented">Assumption</span> of Moses. Moreover, the translators of the LXX. did not understand <span class="accented">satham as</span> "hide." If it had been hidden, and had been discovered, he would have known and translated accordingly. Then when we turn to the next verse, we find that Daniel himself did not understand the command as meaning that he was to keep the vision secret from his contemporaries; so far from that being the case, one at' his reasons for distress is that no one understood the vision. <span class="accented">The vision shall be far many days.</span> That is to say, that a long interval divided the time when the revelation was made from the time of its fulfilment (<a href="../../par/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>); the vision he sees is for many days to come. Before the beginning of the history revealed to Daniel, certainly not many years intervened; but between the days of Belshazzar and those of Antiochus was an interval of approximately four centuries. The Persian Empire rose and fell, and the Macedonian Empire rose and was approaching its fall. At the end of the period, the light of the vision fell most clearly. It was not necessary that Daniel should know the events portrayed to foretell them truly, any more than it was needful that the Second Isaiah should know the exact historical events portrayed so clearly in his fifty-third chapter. Daniel  could not fail to know of Persia, and it even did not require more than a knowledge of the past, and ordinary powers of political forecast, to see that Cyrus might, and probably would, found a world-empire. He knew of the Greeks: there were Greeks in the army of Nebuchadnezzar. Moreover, we learn from Herodotus (1:77) that Nabu-nahid Labynetus had made an alliance with Croesus, in order to check the advance of Cyrus. We know from Herodotus (1:26, 27) that Croesus subdued all the Greek cities in <span class="accented">Asia</span> Minor. To Daniel, who possibly had favoured this alliance with the Western monarch, the King of Javan would mean, not Alexander the Great, as it means to us, but Croesus. But his hopes that Babylon will be delivered by the help of Croesus are shown to be groundless, by the intimation that it will be "for many days." The intimation that he had made to Belshazzar, of the interpretation of the inscription on the palace wall, did not necessarily, in his mind, militate against the hope that repentance might lead to respite. Daniel may have made use of political expedients to help in the result he wished. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a></div><div class="verse">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick <i>certain</i> days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood <i>it</i>.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it.</span> The Septuagint omits "fainted," but otherwise agrees with the above. Theodotion evidently has lind the Massoretic text before him; but he has not understood, and has slavishly rendered it word for word. The Peshitta represents also a text practically identical with that of the Massoretes. Jerome also agrees with the received text; he renders the last clause, non <span class="accented">erat qui interpretaretur.</span> That Daniel should faint, and remain sick for days - "many days," says the LXX. - is quite in accordance with what we might imagine to be the natural effect of intercourse with the spiritual world. The mental strain and the intense excitement incident upon such an occurrence would necessarily produce a reaction. <span class="accented">Afterward I rose up</span>, <span class="accented">and did the king's business.</span> We have no distinct evidence of what the business was that took Daniel to Susa, if he was there in reality, and not merely in vision; but we may surmise that it was about the advance of Cyrus Elam and Media were both embraced in the dominion of Cyrus very early. Cyrus had overthrown the Umman-Manda, and delivered Babylon. At that time there seems to have been somewhat of a <span class="accented">rapprochement</span> between Nabu-nahid and Cyrus; but at the time before us, Cyrus must have begun to realize his destiny, and possibly would not be easy to on. at with. Daniel may have been plenipotentiary of Babylon at the court of Cyrus, endeavouring to secure a treaty. At the same time, aware that Croesus, the rival of Cyrus, might be called in, he continues the negotiation. <span class="accented">I was astonished at the vision</span>, <span class="accented">but none understood it.</span> The idea of the word translated "astonished" is "benumbed;" it may be exegetic of the first clause, explaining the cause of the fainting and subsequent sickness. It is clear that Daniel did not regard the command "to guard <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">satham</span>) the vision" as implying that he should keep it secret. We see, as we said above, that his complaint is that no one understood the vision. Behrmann maintains that <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">maybeen</span>), "to understand," ought to be translated "marked," "observed," but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span> would be the natural verb to use in such a connection, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. Hitzig explains this by saying, "He had imparted the vision to no one." If Daniel had indulged in statements of float kind, the word before us would not have inaugurated a new form of literature. Professor Bevan's interpretation is as farfetched, "And I was no understander thereof." The example he brings forward of ver. 5 is not to the purpose, because the distinction between the first person and the third is too great. Moses Stuart has the same view. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 7"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 9"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"><html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="canonical" href="https://openbible.com/pulpit/daniel/9.htm"><title>Daniel 9 Pulpit Commentary</title><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../bible.css" type="text/css" media="Screen" /><link rel="stylesheet" href="../../print.css" type="text/css" media="Print" /></head><body><div id="fx"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" id="fx2"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="30" scrolling="no" src="../cmenus/daniel/9.htm" align="left" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div><div id="blnk"></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable"><tr><td><div id="fx5"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="112" scrolling="no" src="../top.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav1/daniel/9.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tr><td><iframe width="100%" height="54" scrolling="no" src="../../nav2/daniel/9-1.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="maintable3"><tr><td><div id="movebox2"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><iframe src="../../menu.htm" width="100%" height="50" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe></td></tr></table><table border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="topheading"><a href="../daniel/8.htm" title="Daniel 8">&#9668;</a> Daniel 9 <a href="../daniel/10.htm" title="Daniel 10">&#9658;</a></div></td></tr></table></div><div align="center" class="maintable2"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"><tr><td><div id="leftbox"><div class="padleft"><div class="vheading"><table width="100%"><tr><td width="100%" valign="top">Pulpit Commentary</tr></table></div><div class="chap"><div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-1.htm">Daniel 9:1</a></div><div class="verse">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-27.</span> - THE SEVENTY WEEKS. This is the chapter of Daniel which has occasioned most controversy. It was appealed to by Tertullian and the early Fathers as a demonstration of the correctness of our Lord's claims to Messiahship. It is now received by critical commentators that to our Lord this prophecy cannot refer. Many treatises have been written on the "seventy weeks" of Daniel, and none of them have entirely cleared up the difficulties; indeed, it may be doubted whether all together they have illuminated the subject very much. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans; in the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord same to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem</span>. The version of the Septuagint goes on the assumption that the critics are correct in their belief that the author of Daniel imagined a Median Empire between the Babylonian and the Persian. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In the first year of Darius son of Xerxes, of the seed of the Medes who, that is, the Medes - the LXX. seems to have read <span class="accented">malkoo</span> instead of <span class="accented">homlak</span> - "reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood by the books the number of the years when the ordinance (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) about the land was (revealed) to Jeremiah the prophet to accomplish seventy years to the fulfilment of the reproach of Jerusalem." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic, only he does not seem to have read the hophal of "reign," but the kal. Further, Theodotion omits the second statement of the year of Darius, with which, both in the LXX. and in the Massoretic, the second verse begins. We have in Tertullian a few verses from this chapter in the Old Latin Version, called sometimes the Vetus. It coincides exactly with neither of the Greek Versions, nor with the Massoretic, but is in closer relationship with Theodotion. The Peshitta in the first agrees in the main with the Massoretic texf, but renders the second verse thus: "In the first year of his reign, I Daniel understood in the book the number of years; I saw what was the ordinance  of the number which Jeremiah the prophet had said concerning the completion of the desolation of Jerusalem - seventy years." Theodotion, the Vetus, the Peshitta, and also Jerome, neglect the fact that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">hom'lak</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> hophal, and translate as if the word were kal. This neglect is due to the difficulty of understanding the semi-satrapial position occupied by Gobryas. He had regal powers given him to appoint satraps in the divisions of the province of Babylonia. Not improbably, further, be could fulfil certain sacred functions which customarily only a king could fulfil. This is the only case where the hophal of this verb occurs. Such a unique use of a verb must imply unique circumstances; such unique circumstances existed in the position of Gobryas in Babylon. Only a contemporary would have indicated this singular state of matters by the use of an out-of-the way portion of a verb without further explanation. It is singular that critics will not give the obvious meaning to the persistent indications that the author of this book gives, that he regards Darius, not as an independent sovereign, but as in some sort a vassal of a higher power, on whom he is dependent. <span class="accented">Of the seed of the Medes.</span> This statement naturally implies that while Darius was of Median descent, he was naturalized into some other race. <span class="accented">In the first year of his reign.</span> This phrase has the appearance of representing the original beginning of the narrative. Probably there were originally two recensions of this narrative, one of them beginning with the first verse, the other with some modification of the second verse which has been still further modified till it has reached its present form. The year indicated corresponds to  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, the year of the capture of Babylon, therefore sixty-eight years from the time that Daniel was carried captive. The period, then, which had been foretold by Jeremiah during which the Jews were to be captive and Jerusalem desolate, was drawing to a close. According to the critical assumption, that this date is to be reckoned from the captivity of Jehoiachin ( <span class="date">B.C. 598</span>), there were yet ten years to run, and if it reckoned from the capture of Jerusalem during the reign of Zedekiah, there were twenty years. There is a certain dramatic suitability, if no more, in Daniel studying the prophecies of Jeremiah, with always growing eagerness as the time approached when God had promised release. <span class="accented">I Daniel understood by books. The</span> critical school have assumed that this phrase "books" applies, and must apply, to the canon; therefore it is concluded that this book was written after the formation of the canon, and therefore very late. Unforth-nately for the assumption brought forward, <span class="accented">aephareem is</span> by no means invariably used collectively for the books of the Bible, but K'thubim, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Talmud Babli Shabbath (Mishna), p. 115<span class="accented">a</span>, was also used. Many of the cases where <span class="accented">sephareem</span> appears it is used distributively, not collectively; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Talmud Babli Megillah (Mishna), p. 8<span class="accented">b</span>. From the fact that the same word was used for the third division of the canon, and for the books of the canon as a whole, there was liable to be a difficulty, and hence confusion. Traces of this we find in the prologue to the Greek Version of Ecclesiasticus. Thus in the first sentence the translator speaks of "the Law, the Prophets, and the <span class="accented">others</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)," <span class="accented">as if</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> were mentally supplied before <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. While <span class="accented">sepher is</span> used for any individual book of Scripture, and <span class="accented">sephareem</span> used for a group of these books, as the Books of Moses, it is not used for the Bible as a whole, just as in English we never call the Bible "the books," but not unfrequently "the Scriptures; "on the other hand, we speak of "the Books of Moses," never of the "Scriptures of Moses." If <span class="accented">sephareem</span> does not mean the canon, what does it mean? We know from <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-1.htm">Jeremiah 29:1</a> that Jeremiah sent to the exiles a "letter," and in that letter (ver. 10) it is said, "For thus saith the Lord, After seventy years be accomplished for Babylon, I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place." It is true that this letter is called <span class="accented">sepher in</span> Jeremiah, but in <a href="../../par/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14</a> and <a href="../../par/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a> we have <span class="accented">sephareem</span> the plural, used for a single letter. This is proved by the fact that in Isaiah all the suffixes referring to it are singular; in Kings one is in the plural by attraction, but the other is singular as in Isaiah. The correct rendering of the passage, then, is, "I Daniel understood by the <span class="accented">letter</span> the number of the years, whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet." It is clear that the reference in this verse is to Jeremiah's letter, for we have the use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">Jahw</span> (Jehovah), which out of this chapter does not appear in this book; we have in this verse <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5ea;</span>, which we have in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>; it is vocalized as infinitive piel in Daniel, and infinitive kal in Jeremiah, but there is probably some error in Daniel. Another peculiarity which connects this passage with the "letter" of Jeremiah is the form the prophet's name assumes. In the rest of his prephecy it is usually called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span> (<span class="accented">Yir'myahoo</span>); in the section of which the 'letter forms part, as in this verse in Daniel, he is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (<span class="accented">Yir'myah</span>). It is thus clear that Daniel had in his mind Jeremiah's "letter;" hence it is far-fetched to imagine that he claims acquaintance with all the books of the Hebrew canon, in order  to know the contents of a letter. Even a <span class="accented">falsarius</span> of the most ignorant sort would scarcely fail to avoid the blunder attributed to the author of Daniel by critics. How do the critics harmonize their explanation of this verse with their theory that the canon closed in  <span class="date">B.C. 105</span>, while Daniel was written in the year  <span class="date">B.C. 168</span>. It would be as impossible for an author to speak of the canon in terms which denote it being long fixed, sixty years before it was actually collected, as four hundred years. The impossible has no degrees. <span class="accented">That he would accomplish seventy years.</span> That seventy years would fulfil the period of desolation to Jerusalem. It is to be noted that the word translated here "accomplish" occurs in Jeremiah's letter in regard to this very period (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10</a>). The word for "desolations" is connected by Furst with "drought;" it is also connected with the word for "a sword." The date at which the vision related in the chapter was given was, as we have seen, shortly after the fall of Babylon. The period set by God, if we date from Daniel's own captivity, was rapidly nearing its conclusion. As yet Cyrus had given no sign that he was about to treat the Jews differently from the other nations. The King of Ansan had declared himself - whether from faith or policy we cannot tell - a fervent worshipper of Merodach and the other gods of Babylon: would he not be prone to pursue the policy of the kings of Babylon, whose successor he claimed to be? He had certainly ordered the return to the various cities of the images of those gods which had been brought to Babylon by Nabunahid, but there was no word of the return of the captives of Zion. Would Jehovah be true to his promise or not? Like believers in every age, Daniel takes refuge in prayer.

The true rendering is, as Professor Bevan points out," to set to prayer." Theodotion is nearly as slavish; only he omits "ashes," and has "fastings." The Peshitta is close, but does not follow the change of construction in the last clause. Jerome seems to have read, "my God." The cessation of the temple-worship, with its sacrifices, was naturally fitted to bring prayer as a mode of worship into a prominence it bad not before. Yet we find prayers made while the first temple was yet standing, as the prayer of Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15</a>), of Jehoshaphat (<a href="../../par/2_chronicles/20-6.htm">2 Chronicles 20:6</a>). The comparison more naturally stands with the prayers of Ezra and Nehemiah<span class="cmt_word">,</span> as the subject of their supplication is similar to that of the prayer before us. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-4.htm">Daniel 9:4</a></div><div class="verse">And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I prayed unto the Lord my God, and made my confession, and maid, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments.</span> The versions do not call for remark. The first clause is somewhat of a repetition of the end of the previous verse, and may thus be the indication of there having been two recensions; at the same time, the Oriental style allows greater repetition and redundancy than in Western countries would be permitted. There is a reference here to <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, from which the latter clause is quoted <span class="accented">verbatim.</span> It is also quoted with equal exactness in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-5.htm">Nehemiah 1:5</a>. The chapter in Deuteronomy exhibits God's love for Israel, and hence, as that love is his plea, Daniel appeals to it. We note the evidence of careful acquaintance with preceding Scripture. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-5.htm">Daniel 9:5</a></div><div class="verse">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments:</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments.</span> While otherwise close, neither of the Greek versions retains the change of construction before the last clause, which is exhibited in the English versions. The Peshitta fails in this way ale, but uses participles all through. This verso has a strong resemblance to <a href="../../par/nehemiah/1-6.htm">Nehemiah 1:6, 7</a>, only in Nehemiah there is more elaboration and all the signs of a later development. There is a climax here from simple sin to rebellion; at the same time, this heaping up of terms so nearly synonymous is more liturgic than literary; these words may have been used in the synagogue service in Babylon. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-6.htm">Daniel 9:6</a></div><div class="verse">Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets, which spake in thy Name to our kings, our princes, and oar fathers, and to all the people of the land</span>. The Septuagint, while agreeing in the main with the Massoretic, translates "to all the people of the land" as "to every nation on the earth." Theodotion is more accurate, but the Peshitta maintains the ambiguity. Daniel continues his confession of sin. Not only will they not keep God's commands, but when God sent prophets, men of their brethren, to speak to them with human voice, they would not hearken. The designation of the ordinary inhabitants, the common people, as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e6;</span> ('<span class="accented">am ha'aretz.</span>) is a usage that became more pronounced in later days, when all not educated as rabbin were called 'am <span class="accented">ha'aretz.</span> The resemblance is striking between this passage and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-30.htm">Nehemiah 9:30-32</a>. It is, perhaps, impossible to settle on merely critical grounds which is the more primitive form. There is much in both  passages that would suggest a third form, the independent source of both. Not unlikely the source was some liturgic prayer. As the shorter, the passage before us may be nearer this original source. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-7.htm">Daniel 9:7</a></div><div class="verse">O Lord, righteousness <i>belongeth</i> unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, <i>that are</i> near, and <i>that are</i> far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither thou hast driven them. because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee. O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The versions are all very close to the Massoretic text. The most important variation is Theodotion's repetition of the first clause of ver. 7 at the beginning of ver. 8. Neither of the English versions brings out the contrast in the Hebrew of the second clause of ver. 7; it is "man," not "men," of Judah. This contrast is observed by Theodotion and Jerome, but not by the LXX. or the Peshitta. These two verses have a strong resemblance to Bar. 1:15, 16, "And ye shall say, To our God <span class="accented">belongeth</span> righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as <span class="accented">it is come to pass</span> this day to man of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers." This confession is introduced into the text of Baruch as a quotation. The captives on the river Lud send money to Jerusalem for offerings and sacrifices, and with the money send certain advices. As the circumstances in which the Baruch version purports to be written do not so naturally suit the words used, we can, we think, have no difficulty in recognizing that it is not the primitive recension. The words have the look of a liturgic prayer. The relationship between the present passage and Jeremiah is close; "confusion of face" occurs in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7-19.htm">Jeremiah 7:19</a> as well as <a href="../../par/ezra/9-7.htm">Ezra 9:7</a>. The most marked case is the collocation, "man of Judah, and <span class="accented">inbabitants</span> of Jerusalem." This phrase is frequent in Jeremiah; <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="../../par/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/11-2.htm">Jeremiah 11:2</a>; <a href="../../par/jeremiah/17-25.htm">Jeremiah 17:25</a>. There is also a resemblance to Ezekiel in the phrase, "their trespass that they have trespassed against thee;" <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="../../par/ezekiel/15-8.htm">Ezekiel 15:8</a>; <a href="../../par/ezekiel/20-27.htm">Ezekiel 20:27</a>. The language thus is in strict dramatic suitability to one who has just been studying the prophets of the Captivity. <span class="accented">To our kings</span>, <span class="accented">to oar princes.</span> This could not be used naturally after the date of Daniel. To him who remembered kings and princes in Judah and Jerusalem, this language is natural. In the age of Epiphanes it would be absurd and meaningless. The phrase is used in the liturgic prayer in Nehemiah, because there is a narrative of the history of the people. When we compare the Psalter of Solomon, we find the only King of Israel is God: yet Alexander Jannseus, who was not long dead when that Psalter was written, had assumed the crown; and his sons had competed for the possession of it.

There is a change here which has the appearance of marking an interpolation. The prayer ceases, and an explanatory narrative begins. In content it resembles the parallel passage in Bar. 1, but is much briefer, and therefore more likely to be the older. "Forgivenesses" occurs only here and <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a> in a prayer that otherwise seems borrowed from that before us.

The prayer is resumed during the greater part of this verse. The reference here is to <a href="../../par/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a> and <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>, the probability being more in favour of the latter, from the reference to the "oath." The last clause is a lapse again into the narrative style. In the parallel passage in Baruch it is narrative throughout. This clause may easily have been a gloss added by a scribe and inserted in the text by a copyist. There may, however, simply be an error in the prenominal suffix.

The rest is farily in accordance with the Massoretic. It is clear that in the text before the LXX. translator the word was <span class="accented">shephattanoo</span> instead of <span class="accented">shephatoonoo</span>, that is to say, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">tau</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">vav</span>). These letters in earlier scripts were liable to be confounded. The meaning assigned to  <span class="accented">shaphat</span> in this reading is unusual; but this is rather in favour of it being the true reading; and the return to the second person, while awkward, also has weight. Theodotion and the Peshitta do not call for remark. The use of the word "judges" for rulers generally ought to be noted. If we take the Massoretic reading, there may be a reminiscence of <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a>. Among the Carthaginians the principal magistrates bore the title <span class="accented">suffetes</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">shopheteen. Under the whole heaven hath not been done as bath been done upon Jerusalem.</span> Such language is to be regarded in any case as the exaggeration of grief; but it would have something like a justification twice in the history of Jerusalem, and only twice - after the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and after its capture by Titus. No one has maintained that the origin of Daniel is so late as the latter event; hence we are thrown back upon the former. With the fact before him that temples had been plundered everywhere, and desecrated, and cities sacked, the writer could not have regarded the case of Jerusalem, and its temple, in the days of Epiphanes, as unique under all heaven. After the capture of Jerusalem by. Nebuchadnezzar, the temple was left in rums and the city deserted. Such measure, so far as we know, was not meted out by Nebuchadnezzar to any other city. Only rarely had even the Ninevite monarchs taken such terrible vengeance on rebellious subjects.

Theodotion agrees in the main with the Massoretic text. The Peshitta differs only in joining the first clause of the next verse to this. Ewald makes the prenominal suffix at the end of the verse third person, not second. The very awkwardness of the construction is an evidence in favour of the received reading, "As it is written in the Law of Moses." The passages referred to are those denoted previously (<a href="../../par/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>; <a href="../../par/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.). <span class="accented">All this evil is come upon us</span> - the curses referred to there. <span class="accented">Yet made we not our prayer before the Lord our God</span>; literally, <span class="accented">entreat the face.</span> The face being the sign of favour, "entreated not the favour of the Lord" would be really what is meant; therefore not quite as Ewald renders, "appeased not Jahve." <span class="accented">Understand thy truth.</span> Hitzig thinks here the reference is to God's faithfulness, either in promises or in threats. Keil objects to this, contending that <span class="accented">baamitheka</span> with the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b5;</span> cannot mean "faithfulness," but" truth." This is a mistake; the preposition might alter the significance of the verb it follows, but not that of the noun it governs. The truth is that the word here is extended to its fullest meaning, "God's supreme reality." God's being God implies necessarily that every word he utters of promise or threatening is true; veracity and faithfulness are equally involved in Jehovah being God. At the same time, from the connection it is the evil  - the judgments - he had threatened that bulk most largely in the prophet's mind.

The Peshitta, when one remembers the different division of the verses, is also identical. There is an obvious resemblance here to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/44-27.htm">Jeremiah 44:27</a>, "Behold, I am watching over you for evil, and not for good." The verb <span class="accented">shaqad is</span> somewhat rare, occurring only twelve times in Scripture, and five of these times in Jeremiah. It is not always an evil watching; in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-28.htm">Jeremiah 31:28</a> the two meanings are contrasted. Then follows an acknowledgment of the righteousness of God in so dealing with them Bar. 2:9 is really a version of this verse; the original Hebrew would be almost identical. There are few indications which, did this verse stand alone, would enable one to decide which is the more primitive. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a></div><div class="verse">And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</span> The versions are in agreement with the Masoretic text.

In Jeremiah it is fuller, in Daniel we have only a condensed reference. <span class="accented">Hast gotten thee renown</span>, <span class="accented">as at this day.</span> This is an exact quotation from Jeremiah. The exactness is obscured in our Authorized Version, in which <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-20.htm">Jeremiah 32:20</a> is give)), "Hast made thee a name, as at this day:" the words rendered, "made thee a name," in Jeremiah, are precisely the same as these rendered above," gotten thee renown."

<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-16.htm">Daniel 9:16</a></div><div class="verse">O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people <i>are become</i> a reproach to all <i>that are</i> about us.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O lord, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, lilly holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</span> The Septuagint rendering here is in close agreement with the Massoretic. The only point to be noted in regard to Theodotion is that he gives the late, and in this case inapplicable, meaning to "righteousness" of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, "almsgiving." The Peshitta, imagining a certain want of completeness in the last clause, inserted after "Jerusalem" "is scattered into all lands." The appeal is made to God's righteousness, because now the seventy years were nearing their end, and God's righteousness was involved in the time not being exceeded. "'Righteousness' here signifies the fair dealing (<span class="accented">wohlverhalten</span>) of God to his people in reference to the fulfilment of hie promises" (Behrmann). "Righteousness" is really <span class="accented">righteousnesses</span>, in the plural, the reference being to the many proofs God has given in the past of his benevolence (Keil). "Thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain," forms a further argument: "The mountain of thy holiness" (<a href="../../par/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>). A reproach <span class="accented">to all that are about</span> us. There is a striking resemblance here to Jeremiah: repeatedly in his prophecies are the Jews threatened that they will become a reproach (<span class="accented">herpa</span>). Especially is there a resemblance here to <a href="../../par/jeremiah/29-18.htm">Jeremiah 29:18</a>, the letter of Jeremiah, to which reference is made in the beginning of the chapter. This whole prayer is saturated with phrases borrowed from Jeremiah. The apocryphal Book of Baruch, which has expanded on tiffs prayer, has also drawn from Jeremiah. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-17.htm">Daniel 9:17</a></div><div class="verse">Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.</span> The Septuagint differs here, "Now give ear, O Lord, to the prayer of thy servant, and to my supplications; for thy servant's sake lift up thy countenance upon thy holy mountain which is desolate, O Lord." The omission of the <span class="accented">vav</span> in <span class="accented">tahenoonayiv</span> would occasion the LXX. rendering, "my supplications." They had read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> before, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d1;&#x5d3;&#x5da;</span>. Certainly the Septuagint rendering gives better sense than the violent change to the third person from the second. Keil would escape the difficulty by translating, "because thou art the Lord" - a translation that is independent of Hebrew grammar. The conjunction would not naturally be <span class="accented">lema'an</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>), but possibly '<span class="accented">eqeb asher</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5e7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;</span>). Further, the covenant name would certainly have been used in such a connection, and it would necessarily have been followed by "thou." As it stands, it really asserts that the desolations are on account of the Lord - an assertion which would not be germane to the tenor of the prayer. The reading of the LXX. is thus better here. Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic text, but instead of "O our God," reads, "O Lord our God," and avoids the change of person in the last clause by reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;</span> as a vocative, and inserting <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. The Peshitta has, "our supplication," and avoids the awkward change of person by reading, "for thy Name's sake." Jerome gives a fairly accurate rendering of the Massoretic. only in the last clause he omits "Lord" and renders <span class="accented">temet ipsum.</span> The influence of the Psalter is to be seen in this verse. The first clause is a slightly altered and condensed version of <a href="../../par/psalms/143-1.htm">Psalm 143:1</a>. The verb that ought to open the second member is omitted. The word <span class="accented">tahooneem</span> is not a very common one. <span class="accented">Cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary</span> has a close resemblance to <a href="../../par/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3, 7, 19</a>. As they had no temple sacrifices in Babylon, the captive Jews would have only the psalms of the sanctuary to keep the sense of worship alive in their hearts. 
<div class="versenum"><a href="../../par/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a></div><div class="verse">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.</div><div class="comm"><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18, 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy Name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

The version of the Seventy differs but little from the Massoretic; they read "hear me" instead of simply "hear." The translator also connects the "desolation "with the city, against grammar. The LXX. adds, "Be propitious to us (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>)." The repetition of the vocative in the nineteenth verse is omitted, but "Zion" and "Israel" are inserted after "city" and "people" respectively. Theodotion is in yet closer agreement with the received text. The Peshitta is very close, but adds "ruin" to "desolation." The Vulgate affords no cause of remark. <span class="accented">Our desolations.</span> The word used here occurs in Lamentations. In the prophecies of Jeremiah a cognate word is used, differing from that before us only in vocalization (comp. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12</a>, where it is applied to Babylon after the seventy years of Babylonian rule are ended). <span class="accented">Which is called by thy Name.</span> This phrase is used repeatedly in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/7.htm">Jeremiah 7</a>. of the temple. <span class="accented">Present our supplications.</span> The words used suggest the posture in presenting a petition  - falling down before the person to whom it is addressed. It is one frequently used in Jeremiah, sometimes of persons (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/38-26.htm">Jeremiah 38:26</a>), of God (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/42-9.htm">Jeremiah 42:9</a>). <span class="accented">Not on account of our righteousnesses.</span> There is a marked advance in spiritual insight exhibited by this. The old position was reward according to righteousness, and mercy because of it<span class="cmt_word">.</span> The Jews before the Captivity had very much the heathen idea of paying God by sacrifice for benefits received or asked; but the long cessation of sacrifice raised them above this. <span class="accented">But for thy great mercies.</span> This plea to God because in the past he has multiplied his mercies, is in the same elevated plane. We find a similar line in <a href="../../par/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>, only as an occasion of thanksgiving. It is remarked by Professor Fuller that the repetition of the word <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, and the short sentences, give a feeling of intensity to the prayer suitable to the circumstances. The words used are all echoes of Jeremiah; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "forgive," "hearken," are used in connections that would suit Daniel's study of Jeremiah. It is impossible not to observe to how great an extent this prayer is coloured by Jeremiah. <span class="accented">Excursus on Baruch and Daniel.</span> Professor Ewald, in his 'History of Israel' (v. 206), and afterwards in his 'Prophets of Israel,' emphasizes the resemblance between the opening chapters of the apocryphal Book of Baruch and the ninth chapter of Daniel. After, in the first place, arbitrarily assigning Baruch to the Persian period, he assumes a tendency to rebel against the Persians - a thing of which we have no evidence. Certainly we have no proof against this, because we have no history of the period at all. He assumes that there was constant communication between the Jewish community in Jerusalem and that in Babylon during this period, which, though possible, is not certain. The further assumption, however, that the Babylonian Jewish community would take such a cumbrous device as the apocryphal Book of Baruch to convey their advice to the Jews of Jerusalem, to avoid rebellion, is a strange one for a man of Ewald's acuteness. By the introductory hypothesis in the Book of Baruch, the Jewish community of Babylon send a letter by Baruch to the remnant of the Jews in Jerusalem. If that were so, then it is in Jerusalem, not in Babylon, that this letter, or a copy of it, might be supposed to turn up. Therefore the <span class="accented">falsarius is</span> to be looked for among the Jews of Jerusalem, not among those of Babylon. In Jerusalem would, of necessity, the farce of finding this epistle be enacted. Altogether, there seems no support for the date or origin assigned by Ewald to this book. Of course, if we could have assumed the conclusion of Ewald in regard to the date of Baruch to be correct, it would have been of advantage in our further argument. Ewald further assumes that the opening portion of Baruch has been the original from which the prayer in the ninth chapter of Daniel has been imitated. The resemblance cannot be denied, the question to be decided is - Which is the original and which the imitation? It is a general rule, and one of almost universal application, that the shorter form of a poetical composition - and the prayer in Daniel and in Baruch has that character - is the more original. Unquestionably, if we apply this test, the prayer in the Book of Baruch is later than the parallel prayer in <a href="../../par/daniel/9.htm">Daniel 9</a>. In Baruch the prayer occupies at least sixty verses, in Daniel only sixteen. We would not press the mere fact of brevity, did this stand alone as evidence for the priority of Daniel, as it is possible, but we think little more than barely possible, that the version in Daniel might be a summary of that in Baruch, though summaries are much rarer in poetic literature than expansions. The nature of the differences seem more naturally to be due to expansion than to summarizing. Thus if we compare two closely parallel passages (Bar. 2:9-12 and <a href="../../par/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14, 15</a>), we find the differences are all due to expansions in Baruch on changes that might appear to make the succession of thought easier. Of the latter, an example is" works which he has commanded us," compared with" works which he doeth." The former makes the transition to the thought of disobedience easier. It is possible this change may have been due to the translator misreading the Hebrew before him. The expansions are more obviously additions to the text - they have the invariable character of such things, additions to the words of a passage without being any real addition to the sense. Thus the last clause of <a href="../../par/daniel/9-14.htm">Daniel 9:14</a>, "For we obeyed not his voice," is expanded into "Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice to walk in the commandments of the Lord, which he hath set before us." After the first eight words, which may be regarded as exactly equivalent to the six in Daniel, the rest is mere expansion. Again, the last obtuse of <a href="../../par/daniel/9-15.htm">Daniel 9:15</a>, "we have sinned, we have done wickedly," is expanded into "O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we have dealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances." Any one can see that here the differences are mere expansion, without any addition to the thought. We might carry our investigation further, and would only make our point clearer; but this would be mere loss of time. This expansion and paraphrasing prove the dependence of  Baruch upon Daniel, and therefore the priority of the latter. More important is the utter failure of the writer of Baruch to comprehend the condition of matters at the time he supposes himself writing. In Bar. 1:2 we are told that the Chaldeans "had taken Jerusalem, and burned it with fire." Jerusalem thereafter ceased to be inhabited, for Gedaliah stayed in Mizpah. Yet (Bar. 1:10) the Babylonian Jews say they have sent money "to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings," which it would be impossible to present before God as the temple was a mass of ruins. <a href="../../par/jeremiah/41-5.htm">Jeremiah 41:5</a> cannot be quoted against this, because the Shechemites and Samaritians there mentioned are carrying an unbloody sacrifice, which might be offered to the Lord at the ruins; but there is no word of burnt offerings or sin offerings. And in harmony with this there is no stress laid in the prayer in Baruch, as there is in the prayer in Daniel, on the absoluteness of the desolation of Zion. On the supposition in the Book of Baruch, Jerusalem had still inhabitants, and there was still a high priest, a state of matters utterly at variance with that implied in the Book of Ezra. No such anachronism can be detected in Daniel; his whole prayer speaks consistently of the desolation of Jerusalem. We do but mention the fact that the high priest "Joachim, sen of Cheleias, sen of Salem" (Bar. 1:7) has no existence in the list of the priests we find in Chronicles and Nehemiah. In <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/6-15.htm">1 Chronicles 6:15</a> we are told that Jehozadak "went into captivity," and we know that Joshua was his son. We shall lay no stress on the otherwise unheard-of return to the land of Judah of the vessels "which Sedecias, the son of Joaias, king of Judah had made" (Bar. 1:8), nor on the date in the first verse, "the fifth year in the seventh day of the mouth;" they are in perfect harmony with the general non-historical tone of the whole book. The Book of Daniel has nothing like them. Another historical blunder must be noted  - one that proves the dependence of Baruch on Daniel, and disproves the opposite view. The Babylonian Jews declare their intention (Bar. 1:12) to live "under the shadow of Nebuchodonosor King of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son." This makes Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and his associate on the throne, in contradiction of history as we know it now. We know now that Belshazzar was not the son of Nebuchadnezzar, but of Nabunahid. He may have been the grandson of the great conqueror, but not his actual son. The statements in Daniel, while liable to be interpreted in the sense in which the author of Baruch has taken them, do not necessitate this sense, as we have shown above. In Daniel Belshazzar is never described as the son of Nebuchadnezzar in the same way as Darius is called the son of Ahasuerus. It is true Nebuchadnezzar is called his father, and he himself, according to the Massoretic text, speaks of him as his father; but this means no more, in the court language of Assyria, than that he was his predecessor and was famous. As there is no note of chronological succession in Daniel, Belshazzar's occupation of the throne as representative of his father Nabunahid might be any number of years after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, without contradicting anything in it. A writer acquainted with Daniel, and living long after the events, would naturally drop into the blunder of the writer of Baruch, and make Belshazzar the son of Nebuchadnezzar. On the other hand, it is difficult to imagine the writer of Daniel - if he were a novelist - having Baruch in his hand, and not introducing Belshazzar alongside of Nebuchadnezzar. The artistic possibilities of the situation would have been too great to be resisted. We then feel ourselves necessitated to place Baruch long posterior to Daniel. It is difficult to settle the date of Baruch. The latter two chapters, which are certainly by a hand other than the first three, and probably later, have signs in them that make them late. Bar. 5. is an imitation of the Psalter of Solomon 11. The utter inability to comprehend the cessation of burnt offering and sin offering, implied in Bar. 1:10, shows that it was written before the destruction of the temple under Vespasian. It is scarcely possible that it could have been written after the desolation of the temple by Epiphanes. This definitely overthrows the theory of Kneueker, that Baruch was written in Rome after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus. One who had seen the desolation of Jerusalem under the Romans would not have been under the hallucination of the writer of Baruch, or imagined that burnt sacrifices could have been offered by a high priest in Jerusalem after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. Not unlikely the first three chapters were composed in the reign of the Lagid princes, and had for their object to reconcile the Jews to subjection to the foreign yoke. Israel certainly was still scattered among the countries. The huge Jewish communities in Egypt and Babylon, not to speak of the smaller communities scattered over every city round the basin of the Mediterranean, amply proved that. They were no longer an independent nation, they were always subject to some power, and that was a cause of humiliation. If we are  right in our idea of the date of the Book of Baruch, and of the relation between it and the Book of Daniel, we have proved that Daniel must have existed long prior to the Maccabean struggle.

As to the meaning of this word, there is a difference of opinion, Gesenius holding that it means "wearied out" - a meaning unsuited to the subject or to the context, though in accordance with the use of the word elsewhere.

Furst suggests that it means "shining in splendour" - a meaning perfectly suited to the circumstances, but for which there seems little justification in etymology from cognate tongues. Furst suggests a transposal from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. Winer gives it, "celeriter ivit, cucurrit." This view is taken by Hitzig, yon Lengerke, and Havernick. Ver. 20 is largely an expansion of the first clause of ver. 21. <span class="accented">Whiles I was speaking</span>, <span class="accented">and praying.</span> (comp. <a href="../../par/genesis/24-15.htm">Genesis 24:15</a>, "And it came to pass, before he had done speaking"). This shows the rapidity of the Divine answer to prayer; even before we ask, "our Father knows what things we have need of." <span class="accented">The man Gabriel.</span> The name Gabriel, as mentioned above, means "Hero of God;" and the word here translated "man" is the ordinary word for "man," '<span class="accented">ish.</span> It may be remarked that in Scripture angels are always "men;" never, as in modern art and poetry, "women." <span class="accented">Whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning.</span> This really means "whom I had seen previously in vision," the reference being to <a href="../../par/daniel/8-16.htm">Daniel 8:16</a>. <span class="accented">Being caused to fly swiftly. As</span> above mentioned, there is considerable difficulty in deciding which meaning is to be taken as the correct. Kliefoth's and Meinhold's view would be the simplest, if there were any certainty that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;</span> means "faintness." <span class="accented">Touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</span> Daniel is so absorbed in his devotions that not till Gabriel touched him did he recognize the presence of an an gel-visitant. The time of the evening offering does not imply that those offerings were made in Babylon, but simply that, through the half-century that had intervened since the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar the sacred hour had been kept in remembrance, not impossibly as being one consecrated to prayer. Daniel had been using this season to make known his request and petition to God. "Oblation," <span class="accented">minhah</span>, the bloodless meat offering (<a href="../../par/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1, 4, 14</a>).

The LXX. and Peshitta render the first clause, "And he approached and talked with me." It is difficult to understand how that reading could have arisen from the Massoretic text, or how, on the other hand, the Massoretie text could have arisen from that behind the Septuagint. The rendering of the Septuagint in the last clause is better than that in our Authorized Version, and is in accordance with our Revised, "to make thee skilful of understanding." Theodotion agrees with the Massoretic. Although Daniel was highly endowed, and although he had before him the inspired words of Jeremiah, he had need of yet higher endowments to understand the secrets of the Divine plan. He knew that if he reckoned seventy years from the time when he himself had been carried captive, then the period was drawing to a close: but the <span class="accented">sins</span> of the people were still there. It might be that God would restrain the fulfilment of his promise; the more so that, if the prophecy of Jeremiah were reckoned from the fall of Jerusalem, twenty years would yet have to run. Daniel is concerned about the <span class="accented">sins</span> of his people, knowing that, unless they were removed, renewed punishment would befall them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth, and I am come to show thee; for thou art greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision</span>. The version of the LXX. differs somewhat from this, "In the beginning of thy prayer a commandment came from the Lord, and I came to show thee, because thou art merciful, and do thou understand (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>) the command." The other versions do not present much worthy of remark. <span class="accented">At the beginning of thy supplications.</span> This affords a reason why it was while Daniel "was yet speaking," that Gabriel came to him; the moment the desire was strong enough to shape itself in words, the answer was on  the way. <span class="accented">The commandment came forth.</span> The word translated "commandment" is the very common Hebrew word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">dabar</span>), "a word," "a thing," "a matter," in which sense it occurs in the penultimate clause of this verse. <span class="accented">And I am come to show thee.</span> The angel Gabriel is the messenger sent forth to interpret to Daniel the ways of God with his people. The angel Gabriel is sent to give Daniel an explanatory oracle or word that he may be comforted concerning his people. The reason of this is, "for thou art greatly beloved." This phrase has caused considerable difference of opinion. The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>; the Peshitta, <span class="accented">regee</span>; Jerome, <span class="accented">vir desideriorum</span>; Hitzig's rendering is "darling" (<span class="accented">liebling</span>); Ewald, "dearly beloved one." <span class="accented">Hemoodoth</span> means "desires," "loves;" hence may either be understood subjectively or objectively; in this case, most probably the latter, "a man, the object of love." <span class="accented">Therefore understand the matter</span>, <span class="accented">and consider the vision.</span> The reader will have observed that the last clause is omitted from the LXX. There is a false succession here. Daniel is first commanded "to understand the matter," and then "to consider the vision." Another rendering of the Massoretic avoids this by neglecting the <span class="accented">ethnach</span>, and connecting <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span> with the preceding clause, gives, "thou art greatly beloved and understanding in the matter."

Neither of these seems to be the original of the Greek. Schleusner suggests to read <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. Against this is the fact that Paulus Tellensis renders <span class="accented">lemaz'or</span>, "to bring to nothing" (<a href="../../par/jeremiah/10-24.htm">Jeremiah 10:24</a>, Peshitta). How Wolf ('Siebzigwochen,' p. 26) can say the LXX. confirms the Massoretic K'thib, is difficult to see. The author of the first rendering of this phrase seems to have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5ea;</span> (<span class="accented">ha</span>-<span class="accented">thath</span>) instead of <span class="accented">hatham</span>; the other translator must have read <span class="accented">mahah</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>). The phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to understand the vision," seems a doublet of the clause, "to seal up the vision." There seems to have been in one of the manuscripts used by the LXX. translator a transposition of words; for one of them must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">lehoothan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, since he renders <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. This is an impossible change, but the mistaking of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5df;</span> is perfectly easy to imagine, if <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> had been written in place of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, and it transferred to the place in the Massoretic text occupied by <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span>, then we can easily understand <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5df;</span>. In the last clause the LXX. translator must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;</span>, a clearly inferior reading. The impression conveyed to one is that the translators were able to put no intelligible meaning on the passage, and rendered the words successively as nearly as they could without attempting to make them sense. We must admit, however, that the phenomena that cause this impression may be due to corruption of the text. Theodotion renders, "Seventy weeks are determined (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) upon thy people and on the holy city, to seal sins and wipe away unrighteousness, and to atone for sin, and to bring the everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies." Theodotion, it will be seen, as the LXX., has "prophet" instead of "prophecy," which certainly is more verbally accurate than our version; he omits "to finish transgression," having instead, "to seal sins." The Peshitta has followed the K'thib and renders, "finish transgressions," and instead of "prophecy" has the "prophets." The text of the Vetus, as preserved to us by Tertullian, is, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">breviatae</span>) upon thy people, and upon the holy city, until sin shall grow old, and iniquities be marked (<span class="accented">signentur</span>), and righteousnesses rise up, and eternal righteousness be brought in, and that the vision and the prophet should be marked (<span class="accented">signetur</span>), and the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>) be anointed." Jerome renders, "Seventy weeks are shortened (<span class="accented">abbreviate sunt</span>)<span class="accented">upon</span> thy people and upon thy holy city, to end falsehood (<span class="accented">prevarieatio</span>), to end sin, to wipe out iniquity, to bring in the everlasting righteousness, to fulfil the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies (<span class="accented">sanctus sanctorum</span>)." The Hebrew here is peculiar; the word for "weeks" is in the masculine, which is unexampled elsewhere in the plural. The singular masculine is found, <span class="accented">e.g</span> <a href="../../par/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>; there is no case of feminine singular. Mr. Galloway ('Shadow on the Sundial,' p. 51) would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>  <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, and would render, "by weeks it is determined." There seems little evidence for this reading; against a few late manuscripts is the consensus of versions. "Determined" is also a word that occurs only Lore; it is Aramaic, but not common even in that language. It means "to cut off." It may thus refer to these weeks being "cut off" from time generally; hence "determined." It is singular, and its nominative is plural. "To finish" also causes difficulty; so translated, it implies that the word should be written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>; but it is written <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;</span>, which means "to restrain," "to enclose," "to separate off" (Furst). Hence if we translate as it stands, it should be "restrain transgression." "To make an end of" in also "cause transgression to cease" This in a rendering of the Massoretic Q'ri; if the K'thib had been taken, the translation should rather have been "to seal." "Sins:" this word is plural in the K'thib, but singular in the Q'ri. A large number of manuscripts write the word plural; the Greek versions give the plural; the Pe-shista and Vulgate, Aquila and Paulus Tellensis, singular. "The prophecy," it is clearly an it stands "the prophet." Jerome is the only one of the versions that takes the word in the sense in which it is taken in our versions. Professor Bevan renders it "prophet" (so Hitzig and Hengstenberg). One is tempted to adopt the reading of Michaelis <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, "the vision of the prophet," which has some manuscript authority (Wolf, 'Siebzigwochen,' p. 15). The overwhelming mass of evidence is in favour of the present consonantal text. <span class="accented">Seventy weeks.</span> "Week," while generally a week of days (<a href="../../par/daniel/10-2.htm">Daniel 10:2</a>), was occasionally week of years, as <a href="../../par/genesis/29-27.htm">Genesis 29:27</a>, "fulfil the week of this," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the seven years of service. Among the later Jews this became a recognized mode of reckoning, as in the Book of Jubilees, each jubilee in divided into successive weeks. From what follows it is necessary that the weeks here are sevens of years. "Are determined," as already indicated, means "cut off," not "shortened," which does not seem to be the meaning of the word in any case. "Upon thy people and upon thy holy city." Daniel has been praying long and earnestly for his people; so there would be no inability to see what was meant by "his city and his people." "To finish transgression" is equivalent to "to restrain transgression." Transgression is apt to become bold and imperious; it is a great deal when it is even somewhat "restrained." It is to be noted that, as Daniel's prayer was greatly confession of the sins of the people and prayer for forgiveness, the promises here are largely moral; but still the Messianic period even was not to be expected to be one in which there will be no sin - it is to be restrained. "To make an end of sins" - though "to seal sins" seems the better reading diplomatically it is the K'thib, and that of some of the versions. It is difficult to give the phrase an intelligible meaning. Moreover, the occurrence of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5ea;&#x5dd;</span> so immediately after is against it. Something may be said for <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span>, which occurs in a similar connection with <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5dd;</span> that this does in <a href="../../par/lamentations/4-22.htm">Lamentations 4:22</a>. This is the reading of one of the translators in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> - the spirit of lawlessness would be restrained and the past iniquities and their guilt wiped away. "To make reconciliation " - "to make an atonement." The verb used is the technical word, "the offering of an atoning sacrifice." In this sense it occurs some fifty times in Leviticus. This might apply to the renewal of sacrificial offerings in the temple after the fifty years' cessation during the Babylonian captivity, or to the renewal after the shorter cessation under the oppression inflicted on the Jews under Epiphanes. The next clause implies a wider application and a loftier sacrifice. Professor Bevan is right in maintaining that, despite the accents, this clause is to be connected with the next. <span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">bring in everlasting righteousness.</span> This is more than merely the termination of the suit of God against his people (<a href="../../par/isaiah/27-9.htm">Isaiah 27:9</a>). The phrase occurs in <a href="../../par/psalms/119-142.htm">Psalm 119:142</a>, and is applied to the righteousness of God. These two, "atonement for sin" and "the everlasting righteousness," are found in Christ - his atoning death and the righteousness which he brings into the world. It is true that when Daniel heard these words spoken by Gabriel he might not put any very distinct meaning on them - in that he was but like other prophets; the prophets did not know the meaning of their own prophecies. <span class="accented">To seal up the vision and prophecy</span>; more correctly, <span class="accented">to seal vision and prophet - to</span> set to them the seal of fulfilment (von Lengerke, Hitzig, Bevan). This does not refer to Jeremiah, because his prophecy referred merely to the return from Babylon, and this refers to a period which is to continue long after that. Jeremiah's prophecy was about to be verified. This new prophecy required four hundred and ninety years ere it received its verification. Some event to happen nearly half a millennium after Daniel is to prove the prophecy God has given him to be true. <span class="accented">And to anoint the Most Holy.</span> This phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh qodasheem</span>), is used some forty times in Scripture, but almost always of things, as the altar and the innermost sanctuary (Bevan, 155). Hengstenberg ('Christ.,' 3:119) points out that the phrase for "sanctuary"  is "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;</span>, with the article. He appeals to <a href="../../par/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a> as a case where, without the article, the phrase applies to an individual, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">vayibba-dayl Aheron leheqdeesho qodesh qadasheem</span>), "And he separated Aaron to sanctify him as a holy of holies." This seems almost the necessary translation, despite the versions; for the prenominal suffix must be the object, and "holy of holies" must be in apposition to it. The act of anointing as a sign of consecration, though applied to the tabernacle (<a href="../../par/exodus/30-26.htm">Exodus 30:26</a>; <a href="../../par/exodus/40-9.htm">Exodus 40:9</a>), to the altar (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-10.htm">Exodus 40:10</a>), the laver (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-11.htm">Exodus 40:11</a>), is never applied to the holy of holies. It is applied most frequently to persons; as to Aaron (<a href="../../par/exodus/40-13.htm">Exodus 40:13</a>), to Saul (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), to David (<a href="../../par/1_samuel/16-3.htm">1 Samuel 16:3</a>). The words of Gabriel thus point forward to a time when all iniquity shall be restrained, sin atoned for, and a priest anointed.

The version of the LXX. is widely different from this, "And thou shalt know and shalt understand and shalt discover that the commandments are determined, and thou shalt build Jerusalem a city of the Lord." The change in the first clause is due to a doublet reading <span class="accented">- tishmah</span> being also read as well as <span class="accented">tishkayl</span>, which may have become confluent in the Hebrew text before the Septuagint translator wrote.

The last clause may be regarded as omitted. Not impossibly this may have resulted from the end of the one verse being so like the beginning of the next. Theodotion's rendering is much more in agreement with the received text, "And thou shalt know and understand, from the going forth of the word to determine and build Jerusalem, until the anointed leader, is seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, and he shall return, and the broad places and the wall shall be built, and the times shall be distressful." As above remarked, <span class="accented">harootz</span> is read instead of <span class="accented">hasheeb.</span> The Peshitta differs considerably from the received text, "Thou shalt know and understand from the decreeing of the word to restore and build Jerusalem, to the coming of the anointed king, is seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, to restore and build Jerusalem, its wall, and its palaces, at the end of the time." The rendering of the Vetus, as preserved to us in Tertuliian, runs thus, "And thou shalt know and perceive and understand from the going forth of the speech (<span class="accented">sermo</span>) for the restoring and rebuilding of Jerusalem, even to Christ the Leader, are sixty-two weeks and a half; and he shall return and build in joy, and the wall (<span class="accented">convollationem</span>), and times shall be renewed." Jerome's rendering is," Know and understand from the going forth of the word that Jerusalem should be again built, even to Christ the Leader, shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, and the squares shall be again built and the walls in hard times." What cannot fail to impress one is the confusion that exists as to the original text. Of necessity conjectural emendations have been resorted to, with not much advantage. The most plausible is the suggestion of Professor Bevan to read <span class="accented">lehosheeh</span>, "to repeople," instead of <span class="accented">lehasheeb</span>, "to restore;" but there is no sign in the versions of such a reading being accepted. On the whole, a reading not far removed from the received has probability in its favour. <span class="accented">Going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem.</span> To what does this refer? Hengstenberg ('Christology,' 3:128) says, "There can be no doubt that <span class="accented">motza dabar</span> signifies the issue of the decree." This view has the advantage that in ver. 23 we have the same combination, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">yatza dabar</span>), "a command went forth." The probability is always in favour of holding a word not to change its meaning in contiguous verses, unless there is some indication that a change has taken place. Other commentators assume as strongly that the word must be the word of the Lord to Jeremiah; hence Bevan renders <span class="accented">dabar</span>, "promise," without so much as a hint that there can be any doubt in the matter. Behrmaun takes the <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span>, the sign of the infinitive, as being equivalent to ut, and that hence this is a case of indirect speech - a usage gravely to be suspected, as certainly unexampled elsewhere in Biblical Hebrew.  He refers to Ewald's 'Grammar,' but at his reference Ewald says that yKi is the sign of the semi-oblique narrative used in Hebrew. In a note Ewald refers to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5e8;</span> as introducing speeches; but that is not in point here. If <span class="accented">dabar</span> had meant "promise" or "prophecy" here, it would have been followed with the words in which the prophecy was announced. If, on the other hand, <span class="accented">dabar</span> is taken as" a decree," the infinitive is natural. The question, then, arises, "Whose decree is it that is here referred to?" Daniel was hoping for a decree being issued by Cyrus; of this he would naturally think, but what he thought is not to be taken as necessarily true. The prophets did not always know the meaning of their own prophecies. We must examine the record, and see what decree suits best with the words of our text. Many commentators think the reference here is to a Divine decree (Hengstenberg, Wolf. etc.). The difficulty of this view is that there is in appearance a definite starting-point given for the period named to begin. Now, a decree of God has no visible time-relation. This view, when maintained by those who hold that the prophecy of Jeremiah is referred to, may have some justification, only that a prophecy is never regarded as a decree, rendering certain its fulfilment. It must be, then, a human decree. The decree of Cyrus did not involve any rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem. The altar was set up - that was all; the temple, even, was not built. The terms of the decree of Cyrus, as we have it in <a href="../../par/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a>, are, "The Lord God of heaven...  hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem." This clearly is not the decree intended. When Darius Hystaspis founded his permission to build the temple on the decree of Cyrus, there was no word of permitting them to rebuild the city walls. When, in the seventh year of Arta-xerxes, Ezra and his companions left Babylon and came to Jerusalem, still, though there was no command given to build again the walls of Jerusalem, there is more nearly implied a restoration of Jerusalem as a city. We may, then, start from  <span class="date">B.C. 458</span>. To Nehemiah, in the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, was there a positive command given to build the wall of Jerusalem. This date brings us to  <span class="date">B.C. 445</span>. Starting from the first date, the end of the 490 years is A.D. , and the end of the 69 weeks (equivalent to 483 years) is A.D. . If, again, we start from the latter of these dates, the termination of the 490 years is A.D. , and of the 483 years A.D. . No one can fail to be struck with the fact that these dates are very near the most sacred date of all history - that of the crucifixion of our Lord. We know there is considerable diversity of opinion as to the date at which that event occurred. But, further, we are not to expect that prophecy shall have the accuracy we have in astronomical ephemerides. We admit there are great difficulties. We admit, further, that seven weeks mark, with wonderful precision, the time which elapsed from the capture of Jerusalem to the accession of Cyrus to the throne of Babylon. The interval was really fifty years. We do not know the occurrences that marked the relation of the Jewish people to their Persian masters during the century and more which elapsed between this twentieth year of Artaxerxes and the overthrow of the Persian Empire by Alexander the Great. The city walls and internal buildings of Jerusalem may have taken fifty years to erect - we simply cannot tell. It is, at all events, a singular thing that the date of our Lord's crucifixion so nearly coincides with the termination of the 483 years. What is the result of starting from the date at which the prophecy was given? Assuming that the writer lived in the reign of Epiphanes, and meant to indicate the date of some event near his own period by the end of the 490 or the 483 years, let us see what follows. If we take the Massoretic date of the prophecy, it was given in the year of the accession of Nebuchadnezzar, or the next year - his first year, according to Babylonian chronology, that is to say,  <span class="date">B.C. 606</span> or  <span class="date">B.C. 605</span>. Subtract 483 from either of these, and we have the utterly inconspicuous years  <span class="date">B.C. 122</span> and  <span class="date">B.C. 123</span>, that is to say, twelve or thirteen years after the death of Simon the Maccabee. If three years and a half are added, to reach the middle of the week, we have  <span class="date">B.C. 119</span>, an equally inconspicuous year. Professor Bevan, however, follows Ewald, and begins with the destruction of Jerusalem. That the statement contradicts the text, which dates "from the going forth of a promise to people and build again Jerusalem," according to Professor Bevan's own translation, not from the destruction of Jerusalem, is looked upon evidently as of no importance. Of course, the refuge is the ignorance of the author of Darnel, notwithstanding that Jeremiah (Jeremiah 25:1) dates his first prophecy "the fourth year of Jehoiakim," and his letter (Jeremiah 29:2), after the captivity of Jeconiah, and immediately after. Moreover, something more than ignorance is needed to explain the author of Daniel confounding the going forth of a prophecy to rebuild Jerusalem with the destruction of it. If we take the date of the destruction of Jerusalem,  <span class="date">B.C. 588</span>, and add 483 years, we reach  <span class="date">B.C. 105</span> - a year conspicuous only for the death of John Hyrcanus. This is so obvious, that many  devices have been tried to square matters. Ewald drops out seventy years. Professor Bevan justly characterizes this device as fantastic. Hitzig would make the first seven years run parallel with the first seven weeks of the sixty-two. Professor Bevan rejects this as "highly artificial, and scarcely reconcilable with the text." So, again, in company with Graf and Cornill, he takes refuge in the author's ignorance. If, again, we take  <span class="date">B.C. 164</span>, the date the critics wish to make the <span class="accented">terminus ad quem</span>, which is chosen because it is the year of the purification of the temple; if four hundred and eighty-three years are added to that date, we have  <span class="date">B.C. 647</span> - a date that falls within the reign of Manasseh. As, however, the point of time is the anointing of a holy one, and there is reference also to an anointed prince in this verse, a more plausible date would be  <span class="date">B.C. 153</span>, the year when Jonathan the brother of Judas the Maccabee assumed the high priesthood (1 Macc. 10:21); to this add 483, and 636 is the result - a date during Josiah's reign. Of course, the refuge is the ignorance of our author; he didn't know any better. The difficulty is to understand, if he was so ignorant as to what was so comparatively near his own time, how he was so well informed as to Babylonian affairs. The critics cannot make the author of Daniel at once exceptionally ignorant and exceptionally well-informed. If, however, we take Mr. Galloway's reading ('Shadow on the Sundial,' p. 48) of the LXX. Version of this verse, we have "seven and seventy weeks" or five hundred and thirty-nine years. If we reckon these years from the decree of Cyrus,  <span class="date">B.C. 538</span>, we reach A.D. . <span class="accented">Messiah the Prince</span>; "the anointed prince." Both priests and kings were anointed, as a sign of consecration to their office. Very rarely are priests referred to as "anointed," and never without a distinct statement that they are priests, whereas "the Lord's anointed" always applies to kings. Priests are sometimes called "rulers," <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span> (<span class="accented">negeed</span>), but only in relation to the temple. Never is princedom and the anointing combined in regard to priest. These ideas are connected in regard to Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>). We do not deny that this title would apply to the later Maccabeans, like Alexander Jannseus, who was at once high priest and king. We also note, however, that it applies to our Lord, who claimed to be anointed "to preach good tidings" (<a href="../../par/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>). <span class="accented">The street shall be built again. Rehob</span>, "street," is really "broad place." Instead of the heaps of confused rubbish, the city was once more to be laid off in orderly streets and squares, so that Zechariah's prophecy might be fulfilled (<a href="../../par/zechariah/8-5.htm">Zechariah 8:5</a>), "The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing." <span class="accented">And the wall</span>, <span class="accented">even in troublous times.</span> This was certainly fulfilled in the days of Nehemiah; one has only to read the Book of Nehemiah to see that. The word <span class="accented">harootz</span>, translated "wall," is of somewhat doubtful significance. It means (<a href="../../par/isaiah/10-22.htm">Isaiah 10:22</a>) "a determination." In <a href="../../par/job/41-22.htm">Job 41:22</a> (30) it is translated "a threshing-wain," whereas in <a href="../../par/proverbs/3-14.htm">Proverbs 3:14</a> it means "fine gold." Furst would make it mean here "a marked-off quarter of a city." Gesenius makes it mean here "a ditch " - a view that Winer also holds. Cornill ('Siebzig Jahrwochen,' p. 5) says most interpreters explain <span class="accented">harootz</span>, from the Targumic, as "ditches." It would seem that a bettor rendering would be "a palisade;" the ruling idea of all meanings, save the last, as pointed out by Winer, is "sharpness." "A ditch" or "a wall" conveys no suggestion of sharpness, but "a palisade" does. Not impossibly, before the wall was erected, the city was protected by "a palisade," and would certainly be set up in troublous times. It is to be observed that the events referred to in these two last clauses have no distinct temporal relation to the weeks. We might surmise that it referred to the time during which the city was being rebuilt - street and palisade - but we are destitute of informatiou which might enable us either to confirm or contradict that view. This period may be during the Maccabean struggle; we cannot tell. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself; and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined</span>. The version of the LXX. is nearly unintelligible as it stands, though the genesis of each separate clause from a text akin to the Massoretic can be easily understood, "And after seven and seventy and sixty-two, the anointing shall be taken away, and shall not be, and the kingdom of the heathen shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the Messiah, and his end shall come with wrath, and it shall be warred with war till the time of the end." The first clause has strayed from the end of the preceding verse, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shibeeem</span>), "seventy," is confused with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bb;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shibooeem</span>), "weeks." It is a possible thing that the Kabbalistic use of numbers had something to do with this number, for if these numbers are expressed in letters, and the letters taken as initials, we have the initials of this sentence <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5dc;&#x5e2;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5d1;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5d6;&#x5de;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span>, "The time until the overthrow of Babylon." They must have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5d7;&#x5d4;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>. It is difficult to understand  how "the people of the prince that shall come" could be read, "the kingdom of the Gentiles." save by supposing a somewhat arbitrary paraphrase. The last clause has probably assumed the present shape through the insertion of some part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5dd;</span>, and the omission of the end of the verse. Theodotion's rendering is in closer agreement with the Massoretic text, yet is wide from it too, "After the sixty-two weeks anointing shall be utterly destroyed, and judgment is not in it (or 'him,' <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>), and he (it) shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the leader that cometh; they shall be cut off with a flood, even until the end of the war, having been arranged by disappearances in order." The introduction of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span> is difficult to explain, except as an explanatory addition from <a href="../../par/isaiah/53-8.htm">Isaiah 53:8</a>. Still more difficult is it to understand the genesis of the last clause. The Peshitta, though considerably closer to the Massoretic in the beginning of the verse, is as far apart in the last clause, "And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed shall he killed, and there was not to him, and the city of the holy shall be destroyed with the king that cometh and his end is with a flood, even until the end of the war of the fragments of destruction." The Vetus, as represented by the quotation in Tertullian, is not so close to the LXX. as it usually is, "And after the sixty-two weeks, even the anointing shall be destroyed, and shall not be, and with the coming leader he shall destroy the holy city, and thus shall be destroyed in the end of the war, because he shall be destroyed even to death." This version agrees neither with the LXX. nor with Theodotion. Jerome translates into an eminently Christian sense, "And after sixty-two weeks Christ shall be slain, and his people who will deny him will not be. And his people with a leader about to come, will destroy the city and sanctuary, its end wasting, and after the end of the war desolation determined." <span class="accented">And after three score and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off</span>. The period of sixty-two weeks must begin after the seven weeks have ended, as the completed period to Messiah the prince is seven weeks and sixty-two weeks. <span class="accented">The Messiah</span>: the word has no article, and, therefore, it is argued, it ought to be rendered "an anointed one;" but the use of the article is not so rigid. It is omitted in poetic and semi-poetic passages: <span class="accented">eg.</span> the first word in the Hebrew Bible is anarthreus, although we are obliged to translate it with the article. Further, the Messiah the Prince has already been mentioned, and, therefore, comes somewhat into the region of proper names, as <a href="../../par/amos/7-12.htm">Amos 7:12</a>, "the sanctuary of <span class="accented">king</span>," instead of "the king;" so <a href="../../par/1_kings/21-13.htm">1 Kings 21:13</a>, "curse God and king." We take "Messiah" here as equivalent to "the Messiah" above mentioned. Who is it that is here referred to? The common critical position assuming, without reason assigned, that "anointed" without any subject may refer to a priest, asserts that the reference here is to Onias III. The account of his murder is given in 2 Macc. 4:39. He had succeeded his father, Simon If., as high priest,  <span class="date">B.C. 198</span>. In connection with his high-priesthood is the legendary story told (2 Macc. 3.) of the attempt of Heliodorus to spoil the temple. On the accession of Epiphanes, Jason, the brother of Onias, endeavoured to undermine him with the king, and succeeded: Onias, displaced, in favour of Jason, retired to Antioch. Three years after Jason, in turn, was superseded by Menelaus, who, according to 2 Maccabees, was a Benjamite. Onias rebuked Menelaus for selling some of the sacred vessels; Menelaus bribed Andronieus to put Onias to death, which he did, alluring him from the sanctuary of Daphne, in which he had taken refuge. Josephus gives a different account of matters ('<span class="accented">Ant.</span>,' 12:05), "About this time, Onias having died, he (Epiphanes) gives the high-priesthood to his brother Jesus, for the son whom Onias left was only a child. This Jesus, who was brother of Onias, was deprived of the high-priesthood. The king, being angry with him, gave it to his youngest brother Onias." Josephus adds, "These two brothers changed their names  - Jesus became Jason, and Onias Menelaus. After a little, Onias (Menelaus) was expelled from Jerusalem, and retired to Antiochus and abjured his religion." In 1 Macccabees there is no reference to the death of Onias at all. Certainly the First Book of Maccabees does not take up this part of the history, but if this Onias was murdered, and his murder so affected Jewish feeling, that it became a date of superlative interest in Jewish history - the writer would at least have referred to it. The whole story, as told in 2 Maccabees, has a doubtful look. Even if we disregard the Heliodorus legend altogether, and the suspicion of the whole history which it engenders, we have Menelaus, a man who, according to 2 Maccabees, is a Benjamite, intruded into an office for which only Aaronites were eligible, without a hint that the writer thought it an additional element in the guilt of the usurper. Josephus mentions it as a point against Alcimus, that he was not of the high-priestly family ('<span class="accented">Ant.</span>,' 11:9. 5), yet Alcimus was a descendant of Aaron (1 Macc. 7:13). We have, further, a zealous Jew retiring to Antioch, and, when in danger, betaking himself for safety to the heathen  sanctuary of Daphne. We know the orgies that consecrated the groves of Daphne. These would make Daphne the last place in which a Jewish high priest would seek refuge; if his very presence in the sanctuary would not be held by the Greeks as polluting it. Titus, even though we had not the express evidence of Josephus against it, the narrative is self-condemned. The whole story is baseless, and, whether true or false, did not affect Jewish imagination in the way assumed by critics. Had the story been that, while high priest, he was allured from the sacred precincts of the temple at Jerusalem and been murdered, then the legend, even if untrue, might well have affected the Jews deeply. But a high priest who had surrendered his office and retired into a heathen city was a less sacred person, and his allurement from a heathen sanctuary and his murder was a less heinous crime. The whole notion that Onias III. can be thought of here is an absurdity that would have been scorned at once by these critics, had any necessity of argument required it. The origin of this legend of the murder of Onias IIl. is to be sought in the murder or execution of Onias Menelaus by order of Antiochus Eupator (Jos., '<span class="accented">Ant.</span>,' 12:09.5; 2 Macc. 13:5). Is the anointed one Seleucus Philopator? Bleek, von Lengerke, Maurer, and Ewald hold this view. Seleucus is alleged to have been murdered by Helio-dorus: this rests on the sole authority of Appian, in a narrative in which there is evidence of confusion. Even if it be granted, it is difficult to imagine a heathen prince called "Messiah." Certainly Cyrus is called so in the Second Isaiah, but this is because of the work he is to do for Israel. There seems a necessity to maintain that it was some one who was to be the anointed prince of the Jewish people, who should thus be cut off. <span class="accented">But not for himself.</span> Great difference of opinion exists as to the precise meaning of this phrase. The meaning expressed by the Authorized Version would have required at least in normal Hebrew, not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">v'ayin lo</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span> (<span class="accented">velo'lo</span>). The Revised Version is preferable, "and shall have nothing." It may mean "he shall not be," but that is not so natural. The Revised, however, is vague, and one is inclined to seek for an explanation in a parallel passage in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5e2;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;</span>, "And there was no helper to him." It is no sufficient answer to say, as does Professor Bevan, that <a href="../../par/daniel/11-45.htm">Daniel 11:45</a> applies to Epiphanes, and this does not. The same statement might be made of two different persons. It seems to be a more condensed expression of what we find in <a href="../../par/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>, "Of the people there was none with me." Behrmann's translation is indefensible, "No one remains to him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> follows him;" he gives no particular reference. This view assumes Onias III. to be the Messiah. He was, according to Josephus, on his death succeeded by first one and then the other of his two brothers, because his son was too young for the office. The further assumption has to be made that, in the opinion of the pious, they were not successors of Onias. The pious of that time have left no record of their opinions. <span class="accented">And the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.</span> The word translated "prince" is rarely to be rendered" king." The only cases are these of Solomon (<a href="../../par/1_chronicles/29-22.htm">1 Chronicles 29:22</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="../../par/2_kings/20-5.htm">2 Kings 20:5</a>). The former was anointed, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>, while his father was still living; the latter occurs in a poetical passage. Priests are sometimes called" princes," or "rulers," but that is simply in regard to the house of God and the sacerdotal arrangements. If the verse stood by itself, there would seem little possible difficulty in regard to accepting the old Jewish interpretation which made "the prince" Titus, who was left to carry on the siege of Jerusalem while his father was in Rome, busied with the duties incumbent on the occupant of the imperial throne. Certainly the Romans, the people of the prince, did destroy the city and the sanctuary in a more thorough way than any one since Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="accented">And the end thereof shall be with a flood.</span> It is difficult to decide the reference of "thereof" here. The reference grammatically seems to be restricted to "the people," as that is the nominative of the preceding verb. It may, however, without much grammatical strain, refer to the prince. In regard to prophecy, especially apocalyptic prophecy, grammar cannot be regarded as affording a final canon for interpretation. The main subject of the verse is the Messiah who shall be cut off. There might, therefore, be a reference to him, "his end" being the vengeance that came upon the people for deserting him. This is the interpretation of the Septuagint, "The kingdom of the heathen shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the Messiah," identifying "prince" with "Messiah," and his end shall come with wrath." Theodotion refers to the city and the sanctuary, for he has, "They shall be cut off with a flood." The Peshitta refers to the king that cometh. The Vetus has <span class="accented">finem belli.</span> Jerome has <span class="accented">finis eius vast#as</span>, his reference being to the city. The idea of Hitzig, that the prenominal suffix refers to the campaign, seems the most natural one. Of course, Hitzig refers it to the campaign of Antiochus, but the interpretation does not necessitate that.  <span class="accented">With a flood</span>; not a literal flood. This word does not elsewhere refer to a number of men, save in the eleventh chapter of this book; that chapter, however, is of doubtful authenticity. All that we draw from the use of <span class="accented">shateph</span>, "a flood," for "a multitude of men," and of <span class="accented">shataph</span>, "<span class="accented">to</span> overflow," "to overrun," is that, in the opinion of the author of the eleventh chapter, the phrase here means "a multitude of men." "Wrath," or "devastation," seems to be the best meaning of the word. The latter seems, on the whole, the more natural rendering here. If so, no one can fail to see how apt a description it gives of the state of Judaea, and especially of Jerusalem, after the war which was concluded by the capture of the city by Titus. <span class="accented">And unto the end of the war desolations are determined.</span> Rather it should be rendered, "until the end was the decree of desolations," viz. the end of this campaign above referred to, and until that end is reached, <span class="accented">war</span>, which is itself a decree of desolations, is determined. Taken thus, this clause explains that which has gone before. The text here, however, is evidently in such a corrupt state that no decision can be made with any feeling of confidence. The Septuagint appears to have read <span class="accented">yillahaym</span> instead of <span class="accented">nehresheth</span>, and has omitted the last word altogether. Theodotion has, "by order in disappearances," but one cannot tell what Hebrew words these represent. The Vetus, which usually stands closely related to the Septuagint, omits a number of words.

In this mass of confusion this much is clear - the clause, "the covenant shall be strong (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) upon many," is a doublet of the clause, "when he shall confirm the covenant to many weeks." The clause, "and after seven and seventy times and sixty-two years," is a doublet of the beginning of the twenty-sixth verse; "Till the end of the war, and the desolation shall be taken away," is an alternative version of the last clause of the twenty-sixth verse. When those extraneous elements are got rid of, we have left a rendering of the twenty-seventh verse, which may afford us light as to the text. "The covenant shall be strong upon many" is a possible rendering of the Hebrew (see <a href="../../par/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>). The alternative reading, "when he shall confirm (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) the covenant during many weeks," implies the infinitive with the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5b0;</span>, and "weeks" in the plural, and one omitted - the latter is omitted, indeed, by both. "And in the end of the week" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">qaytz</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">hatzee</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "sacrifice and offering shall be taken away, and upon the temple shall be the abomination of desolation"  -  reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>), "holy," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>), "wing," "outspreading," or it may be tendered "wing of temple" - "until the end, and an end be given to desolation" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">toottan</span>), "is given," or "appointed," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tittak</span>), "poured out." Theodotion is closer to the Massoretic, "And one week shall confirm (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) a covenant to many, and in the middle (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) of the week my sacrifice and offering shall be taken away" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">zebehee</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d6;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span> (<span class="accented">zebah</span>), and possibly <span class="accented">min hath</span>, instead of <span class="accented">minhah -</span> "and upon the temple (shall be) the abomination of desolations, and till (at) the end of the time an end is set (given) to the desolation." It will be observed that Theodotion agrees with the LXX. in reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>), and <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5bb;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span> (<span class="accented">toottan</span>) instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tittak</span>) The Peshitta is closer still to the Massoretic, but the last verb the translator seems to have read as <span class="accented">tanah</span>, "shall rest." Tertullian, in his quotation from the Vetus, shows that in this verse it follows Theodotion, or rather the version which he made his basis. He, however, connects "half a week" with "one week." The Vulgate rendering is, "One week also shall confirm the covenant to  many, and in the middle of the week sacrifice and offering shall cease" - reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>: (<span class="accented">yishbath</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "and in the temple shall be the abomination of desolation" - therefore reading with the Greek versions and the Vetus, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span> - "and even to the consummation and end shall the desolation continue" - reading, therefore, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>, and omitting the preposition <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> ('al), "upon" - the latter is not a probable reading. From this examination of the versions one thing is clear - we must accept, with all its difficulties, "confirms." Gratz would change one letter, and translate, "he shall cause many to transgress the covenant." The wilder supposition of Professor Bevan, which would change two letters, and translate, "the covenant shall be annulled for many," is equally out of court. The next point is <span class="accented">kenaph</span>, "expansion." Here the Greek and Latin versions, including that in <a href="../../par/matthew/24-15.htm">Matthew 24:15</a>, but excluding the doublet mixed up in the text of the Vatican and Alexandrian Codices, have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>. The Peshitta and the author of the reading intruded into the Alexandrian Codex have read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>. (<span class="accented">kenaph</span>). However, these two are not agreed as to the interpretation. The Peshitta renders "wings," the Vatican and Alexandrian scribes render <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, the word used (<a href="../../par/matthew/4-5.htm">Matthew 4:5</a>) for a pinnacle of the temple. There is, whichever is preferred, not the slightest justification for the suggestion of Kuenen that we should read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span> Professor Bevan thinks "this emendation is well-nigh certain." If that is so, any suggestion of any critic may be equally commended. We have practically four Greek versions here, two Syriae if we include Paulus Tellensis, two Latin, and not one of them gives the slightest hint that this "well-nigh certain" reading was in existence. The balance of evidence is decidedly in favour of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (<span class="accented">qodesh</span>), especially so in the light of our Lord's words. Had the text with which his hearers were familiar contained the suggestive word <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>, "wing," it was impossible, speaking as he did of the setting up of the Roman eagles in the temple, to have avoided remarking on the word used. Our Lord in this case must have had the Hebrew before him, as he does not render as the Greek versions do, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>. We must thus hold <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> to have been the original text. <span class="accented">And he shall confirm the covenant with many.</span> What is the subject of the verb here? Hengstenberg, Hitzig, and yon Lengerke make the one week the nominative of the verb. Professor Bevan objects that to represent a week making a covenant, or making it burdensome, is without analogy. Both Hitzig and Hengstenberg appeal to Malachi 3:19; <a href="../../par/isaiah/22-5.htm">Isaiah 22:5</a>; <a href="../../par/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3</a>, where a "day" is represented as acting. Theodotion translates thus. The natural meaning, according to the Hebrew, if we do not pass beyond the clause before us for the subject of the verb, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, (<span class="accented">bereeth</span>), "covenant." Thus we ought naturally to render either - taking the hiphil in its causative sense - "a covenant," or "the covenant shall confirm;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> secure "one week to many," or - and this is better, as supported by <a href="../../par/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> (4), in the sense given to the hiphil of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span> (<span class="accented">gabar</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> "the covenant shall prevail for many during one week." This agrees with the first version we find in the Septuagint, The covenant - God's covenant with Israel, and this it must be here - "prevails with many;" his covenant to send a Messiah, a part of the eternal covenant with Israel, would prevail with the hearts of many of Israel during one week. If we reckon our Lord's ministry to have begun in the year A.D. , and the conversion of St. Paul A.D. , we have the interval required. After the conversion of St. Paul, the Gentiles more than the Jews were brought into the Church. Another theory is that it is the coming prince who is referred to. This is assumed by critics to be Antiochus; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald. Moses Stuart, who adopts this view, refers to the covenant made with Antiochus by many of the Jews. But <span class="accented">bereeth</span> thus absolute, is used not of alliances, but of the Divine covenant. The theory that the coming prince is Jason the brother of Onias does not suit with the idea of confirming the Divine covenant, so the interpreters that hold this view - <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bevan - do not make "the prince" the subject of the verb. If <span class="accented">bereeth</span> is the Divine covenant, as by usage it is, then the prince whose people were to lay waste the temple and city cannot be he that confirms the covenant. We might take the last clause of ver. 26 as in a parenthesis, and regard the subject of the verb "<span class="accented">confirm"</span> as the Messiah who was cut off. It seems, however, preferable to take the construction as we have done above, and make <span class="accented">bereeth</span> the subject of the verb. <span class="accented">And in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease.</span> In accordance with our interpretation of the previous clause, we would interpret this, "The covenant shall cause offering and oblation to cease." What covenant is this? The new Messianic covenant promised in <a href="../../par/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>. The author of the Epistle to the Hebrews (Hebrews 8:8) quotes this passage as Messianic, and as proving that sacrifice and offering had ceased with <span class="accented">Christ's</span> sacrifice of himself. Interpreters of the critical  school are reduced to considerable difficulties in their endeavours to square this passage with their preconceived notions Bevan admits that the natural subject of the verb <span class="accented">yashbeeth</span> is the "prince who shall come;" but having come to the conclusion that this coming prince is Jason, he could not be said to make sacrifice and offering cease. Professor Bevan is constrained to change the reading from hiphil into the kal. He has certainly the justification that the Septuagint and Theodotion both make the word passive. Ewald regards the coming prince as Epiphanes. If so, then he must be the subject all through. In that case we are obliged to contradict usage and maintain that the covenant confirmed refers to an alliance made with apostate Jews; but this, as we have said, contradicts the usage in regard to "covenant" in this absolute position. Further, we have, in the end of ver. 26, the "end of the war" referred to. Yet, according to this interpretation, after the war is over the prince is making sacrifice and offering to cease. Ewald, recognizing the difficulties of his interpretation,declares, "As soon as the discourse touches upon the man and his projects, it is at once agitated with the profoundest disorder." <span class="accented">The midst of the week.</span> On the ordinary Christian interpretation, this applies to the crucifixion of our Lord, which took place, according to the received calculation, during the fourth year after his baptism by John, and the consequent opening of his ministry. Hitzig and many critical commentators see a reference in the half-week to the time, times, and half a time, and they identify that with the time during which Antiochus had set up the heathen altar in the temple. It is to be observed that this view has the support of 1 Macc. 1:54, which applies the next clause to Antiochus. If the traditional view is correct - that the prophecy published in the days of Cyrus applied to the coming Romans - then it was but natural that a writer in the clays of John Hyrcanus should be prone to interpret the prophecy of events in his own time. As we have already seen, the reference cannot be to Antiochus. The extreme popularity of Daniel by the time 1 Maccabees was written, probably about  <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, is to be observed. <span class="accented">For the overspreading of abominations</span>, <span class="accented">he shall make it desolate.</span> This is rendered in the Revised Version, "And upon the wing of abominations shall come one that maketh desolate;" in the margin the rendering is, "upon the pinnacle of abominations." We have seen that the great balance of evidence was in favour of inserting <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, "holy place," instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>, "wing." Even if we take the Massoretic reading, and render it according either to the text or the margin, we have difficulties. We have no instance of a bird supporting itself by one wing. If <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;</span>. (<span class="accented">konaph</span>), "wing," is retained, the reference to the Roman eagles can scarcely be resisted. The word has several derivative meanings: "The edge" of the earth, as <a href="../../par/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>; from this is derived the rendering in the Revised. In the present passage, Gesenius, Furst, and Wirier regard it as equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>; but no such meaning is elsewhere found in Hebrew. "<span class="accented">He</span> shall make <span class="accented">it</span> desolate." In Hebrew, this is only one word, <span class="accented">meshomaym</span>, the participle. The word occurs twice in <a href="http://niv.scripturetext.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1, 4</a>, and there means "astonished," "stupefied." It is imitated in <a href="../../par/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>, but the preceding word, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">shiqqootz</span>), is in the singular, and agrees with <span class="accented">meshomaym.</span> Here we have the noun <span class="accented">shiqqootzeem in</span> the plural while the participle is in the singular. In <a href="../../par/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a> we have another variation, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>. The versions translate as if the word had been in the singular; hence we may doubt whether the noun was not originally singular, all the more that in the parallel passage (<a href="../../par/daniel/11-31.htm">Daniel 11:31</a>) we have the singular used. An accidental reduplication of the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span>, which begins <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, would explain the present reading. Professor Bevan suggests that we read <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5bb;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, the hophal participle plural from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span>, "to sit;" but the evidence of the versions is decisive against this. The rendering of the clause would be thus, "and upon the temple the abomination of desolation." The usage of <span class="accented">shiqqootz</span> leads us to think of heathen idols, as <a href="../../par/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1</a>, Chemosh, the abomination of Moab; Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon, <a href="../../par/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a>; Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Zidonians. More important is <a href="../../par/jeremiah/32-34.htm">Jeremiah 32:34</a>, "They set their abominations in the house that is called by my name, to defile it." We have here the combination suggested by Professor Bevan. From the fact that Daniel seems to have been saturated with Jeremiah, his suggestion might have had weight; but the utter want of any hint in the versions that the reading was even doubtful, compels us to be against this view. There is no case where <span class="accented">shiqqootz</span> means "altar," but many where it means" idol." So the setting up of a heathen altar is not what would naturally be thought of in this connection. The traditional opinion, that this refers to the Roman eagle standards, which were in a sense "idols," and were regarded especially as such by the Jews, is certainly at least plausible on grammatical grounds, and may be regarded as certain from other reasons; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> its suitability to the meaning of the other verses. <span class="accented">Even until the</span> <span class="accented"> consummation</span>, <span class="accented">and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate.</span> The Revised Version is very different here, "And even unto the consummation, and that determined, shall <span class="accented">wrath be</span> poured out upon the desolator." We have already seen that <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tittak</span>)," poured out," must be abandoned, as not present in any of the versions. Most of them have read    <a href="../../par/1_samuel/2-15.htm">1 Samuel 2:15</a>. The generality of the phenomenon is due to the normal structure of the Hebrew clause. An end shall be set some time to the desolation of Zion, although that end may coincide with 'the end of all things. <p> <p> </div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">Pulpit Commentary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://openbible.com">OpenBible.com</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span></div></div></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="../daniel/8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="../../leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="../../left.png"' title="Daniel 8"><img src="../../left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Daniel 8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="../daniel/10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="../../rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="../../right.png"' title="Daniel 10"><img src="../../right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Daniel 10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="../../botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="../../botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="../../botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="../../botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="../../botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="../../botmenu.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html><script>
